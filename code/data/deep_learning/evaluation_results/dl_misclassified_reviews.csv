Buffalo,airport,Seth Dobso,10/30/2018,"Security gave bad information on where to pickup Megabus. This is a chronically late bus service and security knew they weren't giving good info. It's not marked in the bus area. The whole situation is sketchy. I never got to take my trip, lost a lot of time and some money on a chilly morning. Really had it with these people, thanks again for keeping us safe.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abu Dhabi,airport,4 reviewsNash Degaonkar,12/13/2024,"The Airport is pretty decent in a lot of aspects. The duty free is vast, the airport staff and security are ultra professional, helped me guide through the terminal on where to find my gate. However, the Wi-Fi experience could have been better, because doing facetime calls was a problem, considering whatsapp is not allowed. Anyhow, it is massive.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Burgas,airport,Mike Lambert,9/7/2020,"Rude, offensive and arrogant staff. Unbelievable old-style bureaucratic approach. The customer is always wrong. Do not live up to the values they have on the Fraport website. Only 3 members of staff to process a huge queue when no other flights. Priority queue much slower than non-priority queue. Would recommend all members of staff attend customer satisfaction training.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Cagliari,airport,Lorenzo Pasquini,1/27/2006,"New nice and clean. This is the way I found this airport services are quite good even if restaurants bars and services in general could be improved. But this is a recent airport and the overall experience has been positive maybe in the future it will earn some more ""stars"".",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Agadir,airport,H Chown,10/14/2011,"Arrived in the middle of a hot summer's day with a temperature over 40 degrees. There is no air-conditioning in the airport but that isn't necessary due to the design of the terminal which keeps it airy and cool. The border staff looked like they had been asleep for five hours and were surprised by our arrival. Unfortunately there were lots of people outside fighting for the right to carry our bags 20 metres to the taxi. It's a bit of an annoyance but just say ""NON"" very assertively. All signs in French and Arabic announcements too.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Brasilia,airport,G Castro,9/23/2009,Brasilia airport is probably the best Brazilian airport. The shopping/eating area is good and with a great variety. The information desk is good and people friendly not to mention the architecture that is beautiful. The bad things about the airport are Transportation - Buses not as frequent as they should be. No metro or train. Boarding area - once you pass Security the airport is too crowded and not having the same amenities as the pre-boarding area make the journey less comfortable. Too small for the traffic it has. Drop off/Pick Up passengers: There is a lack of enforcing the laws and people park in the drop off areas making it difficult to approach sometimes.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,T Butz,4/2/2022,"Could not be worse run. The absolute model of inefficiency. The say allow 3 hours to check in, and they mean it. Line 1 - cue to enter, docs checked. Line 2 covid test verification Line 3 bag tags docs checked. Line 4 Aruba customs docs checked. Line 5 go through screening docs checked, Line 6 reclaim bags, Line 7 check bags again docs checked, Line 8 US customs docs checked, Line 9 go through screening again - I’m not kidding you have to have your carryon and yourself screened twice. You have to drop off, reclaim and drop off your bag again. My passport and boarding pass was checked no less than 5 times. I had to answer the screening questions 3 times. I booked a repeat visit and have now canceled it. The only reason for 2 stars not one is that there is a nice wine bar but chances are you won’t get to enjoy it as you waste your life away in hours upon hours of senseless lines. The airport process is an astonishing failure in customer service.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Ahmedabad,airport,1 reviewsM Hurvil,6/20/2024,"I've been to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport a few times and each time my experience hasn't been good. When I go on family trips, the wheelchair facility is terrible. They board people with wheelchairs last, which hasn't happened at any other airports I've been to. The second issue is that there is no crowd management, everyone just boards the plane at once which leads to shoving and pushing people. However, even with all these people, the airport lacks chairs and seats at the gates. Every time I've traveled from AMD, all my gates had only 15-20 seats which is clearly not enough considering how busy the airport is. The worst part of this airport is the staff, they do not understand requests and are not sympathetic at all. The positives of this airport are the food options is good and has a variety of meals. The other positive thing about the airport is the cleanness.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Bacau,airport,A Dron,7/20/2013,Probably the smallest airport I have experienced. On arrival distance between the entry doors from the apron to the immigration desks can not be more than 5 yards. This means that passengers have to queue outside which in inclement weather must be unpleasant. Passport checks were fast however. On departure similarly tiny landside area with minuscule cafe to left of entrance doors. Incredibly cramped check-in/security area to right of doors although check-in agent friendly and helpful. Security checks are very thorough - had to remove belt watch etc and they found small jar of jam I'd absent-mindedly packed in my carry-on bag. Departure lounge was standing room only for a single Boeing 737. Couple of vending machines are the only refreshment sources. Local people told us that a major expansion of the airport is planned but from look of abandoned foundations beside the existing terminal this is unlikely to be completed any time soon. In short staff seem fine but can not recommend because of lack of space and facilities - even allowing for the fact it's a regional airport not a major hub.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bari Palese,airport,Vasilis Mintzolis,7/19/2023,I wanted to leave my baggage at the airport and visit the city as I had a few hours between flights. But since there is no left luggage at the airport I had to stay at the airport as I couldn’t move in the city with 35 degrees carrying my suit cases. It would be nice for the officials to create such a place. It will endeavor passengers to explore the city of Bari,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Blantyre,airport,Wilbert Wolfs,2/2/2009,Arriving at Blantyre's Chileka airport is a colonial experience. Arriving from Johannesburg the airplane is taxied in front of the arrival hall. School classes have already been run out to see the big bird landing. The building has a wooden veranda and there is a special area were people are expected to cheer after the president has landed. The first time I arrived at Chileka the luggage was simply dropped on the tarmac. The passengers had to fight to get their possessions. Of course quite some passengers did not find any luggage at all as it had stayed behind in Jo'burg. Immigration is quite impressive with a lot of stamps in passports and on listings. To get out you have to go through a door then you turn sharply turn left and right. Again left until you bump into the departing passengers and their luggage. Since half a year we have a new arrival hall at our airport.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Bishkek,airport,Kieran Shotter,6/29/2019,"Small airport which seemed a bit chaotic. Flew with Turkish airlines their first flight was delayed so check in for mine was busy due to 5 counters checking in two full flights. Immigration was quick didn't ask to many questions. Security metal detector doesn't work they just pat down everybody coming through. After security, not much food places on one end can get busy in the departure area. Boarding was a mess no queuing system for two flights with desks close together so people kept getting into the wrong queue. Fine airport for a short time.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Bahrain,airport,Tony Williams,6/3/2024,"I enjoyed 2 lengthy stop overs here on a recent flight to BKK in Biz class with Gulf Air. The airport is amazing, clean, and transit was smooth. The lounge was fantastic and food and drinks were excellent. Staff throughout the airport were amenable and friendly. Overall it is a much less stress free and agreeable experience in comparison to transit through Doha or Dubai.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Aalborg,airport,Klaus Malling,2/11/2014,"A small very effective airport with few flights. Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well. There is a nice viewing pavilion at one end of the airport. Outside note the famous ""kiss and goodbye signs"". Restrooms outside terminal however few.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,S Adewale,3/3/2007,In Nigerian standards relatively clean and organized. However I was bored out of my mind when waiting for my flight because the shopping and entertainment possibilities is nil. Overall and compared to Lagos domestic terminal this airport is paradise on earth.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Beijing Daxing,airport,Andy Wilson,6/9/2023,"Big, nice and clean airport. But that’s all. The airport (international departure) is way too big, the airport is very empty. Check-in is very frustrating. Travelled with Qatar Airways and always have had pleasant experiences with them. Not at Daxing airport. 2kg overweight for 2 person was an issue. Needed to re-arrange. After that the check-in lady wanted to weigh the cabin luggage. That was slightly overweight as well. But she wanted to charge 40USD/kg. Although it is the airlines right, never had this experience before with Qatar Airways. She didn’t want to issue the boarding pass until we cleared some stuff. After some negotiations we said we will clear at the gate. This frustrated the journey. At the end they did not check anything at the gate. The queue at the check-in counter was very long. After queuing for a while we realised a separate queue for online-check-in. Time wasted. The signs were not clear and the personnel was not pro-active to inform people. You also need to do a health declaration (arrival and departure). But the machine at the airport is a joke and doesn’t work most of the time. The security check checks every inch of your body, never had this experience as well. They have to take a photo of you prior you clear immigration, at the immigration and when going through security. Every baggage you have they need to take a photo of you and the baggage. For what?! Shops were closes in the evening (after 10pm) and hardly any food courts or restaurants. Disappointing. The connection to the airport is not so convenient: high speed trains every hour or so from Beijing West Railway Station, but the tickets need to be bought in advance. Or metro, but if you are coming from downtown, you need to change metro couple of times. Taxi would be an alternative. Overall, I would prefer Beijing Capital International Airport.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bergerac,airport,Richard Lindsay,6/24/2013,This airport is small so whilst access is good facilities are very limited. Airside there are only 2-3 vending machine so if you want anything to eat or drink best use the bar Landside. Do not carry tins (eg Duck Confit Pate etc) that are greater than 100g in hand luggage - they will be confiscated at security.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Baku,airport,1 reviewsC Anderson,1/29/2019,"Very new, modern looking airport. Easy check in process, short lines. Affordable luggage wrapping process. Departing lounge spacious, easy to use. Definitely security process can be improved - only 1 or 2 lanes available.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,M Edwards,5/3/2018,"I had an awful experience at this airport. The screening agent was extremely rude and disrespectful. She emptied out the contents of me up bag and toiletries into a dirty bin that is used by thousands of people. My personal hygiene products, everything. I had a wonderful trip in Barbados but this type of experience cast a negative view over my overall trip. I wouldn’t return here because of this. Terrible staff in the airport, not the lasting impression that should be sent on with visitors.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Broome,airport,Joshua Smith,10/11/2005,Nice little airport. Size is adequate for the small number of flights a day. Departures and arrivals are separate buildings so it is quick to check-in and collect baggage. Departure hall is basically a pergola with a shop and a bar but it's fine. On arrival you get free trolleys which is a bonus.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,Paul Wharmby,9/8/2013,We travelled to Turkey on Jet2 mid-August returning early-September. We travelled from Blackpool as the holiday was some £250 cheaper than using Manchester. The car park ticket machine had run out of tickets but that didn't matter as the barriers to P2 had been broken off. We parked a good 5 minutes' walk from the terminal but it's free so I don't really see that being a problem. The terminal building is very basic and is more reminiscent of a coach station but check-in and security were both quick and easy (as was paying the ADF) and we were sitting in the bar area enjoying our first drink of the holiday while we'd still have been in the security queue at Manchester. An important point was that because we were going on a small plane to a small airport check-in at Dalaman on our return was incredibly easy drawing jealous stares from fellow travellers who were in 200-long queues. On our return to Blackpool from wheels stop through security and baggage reclaim to leaving the airport took less than 30 minutes. You absolutely cannot get better. The airport has a runway planes somewhere to sit and somewhere to get a drink. What else do you need?,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Antwerp Deurne,airport,Karel Hladky,7/21/2008,What an amazing little airport ! All flights depart from Gate 1 - there being only Gate 1. Nice little shop the restaurant is being rebuilt. Do not arrive too early for your flight as everything shuts in-between flights.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Amman Queen Alia,airport,Jaime Cousin,3/8/2024,"Awful experience during the security check as a female traveler. My bags went through the scanner and they requested to physically check 2/3 bins. After a rude check of my 2 bins they decided without reason & at the final moment to check my 3rd bin. I had food, which included cheese, they decided that cheese is liquid and refused that I take it. This bin was not flagged by the scanner - and cheese is not liquid. This was an arbitrary nonsensical decision. I’m furious that they are making this calls without any checks and balances. Furthermore I feel like I was discriminated upon as a female solo traveler.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Beijing Capital,airport,Josh Gee,7/23/2024,"Be careful when having duty-free. I took Air China from Singapore to Beijing Airport for a layover, we were hand carrying our duty-free bought in Singapore for my relatives. When passing customs into domestic flights, we were told Duty-Free were to be put in cargo so we sent it to be put in cargo. Keep in mind we were using a fabric bag so it's not very protective. We put the fragile sticker on the bag and GUESS WHAT? They put 2 heavy hard casesd luggages on top of our bag and they threw our bag onto the belt to bring it to cargo hold. I could feel the thud from the throw as I was in a Window seat above the cargo hold. They even threw our bag in the cargo hold. They threw our bag 2 times so hard I could feel the thud in the cabin. After we got our bag, we found the duty-free leaking. It was a $60 bottle of alcohol for my relatives. Airport was ok just the ground crew.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Brussels Charleroi,airport,1 reviewsMarc Harris,9/28/2024,"Really not sure what all the hate and negativity is about. Through security in six minutes. Through border control in two minutes. Loads of seats. Really good quality restaurants and bars which weren’t an absolute rip off. Toilets are only pay toilets before departures. Then all free, assume due to stop people wandering in and using. Sat by gate 25 now for a full flight back to Manchester and all is fine. Was proper worrying before but it’s been a pleasure. Only negative was went in wrong car park dropping the hire car back, but that my my fault.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Akron–Canton,airport,M Anderson,5/6/2017,"Easy to get around. It was the perfect size for someone on foot. The staff seemed like a small town community. Everyone seemed to be in effective communication with each other. Traveler satisfaction was clearly a priority for the staff at Akron Canton airport. I felt a good, positive energy there. I liked the choices of food and beer that were available throughout the gates. I liked how well my emotional support dog was greeted and welcomed into the airport and on all three flights I took home. I will fly to and from this airport in the future.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Bucharest Otopeni,airport,Joe Ghinet,6/22/2024,"When standards are low you don't know any better. No responsibility, no accountability no vision, no desire to change for better. Change for worse is easy, you don't do anything. All standards are improving in the industry but here is only complacency, and ignorance. Staff is disgruntled, aware that nothing works therefore no respect for their job. Processes that should work smoothly are just road blocks such as recovering luggage once flight was postponed. Airport in huge disrepair, and miserable as if you were waiting in a bus station close to a garbage dump. Business lounge Dacia, another bad experience, smoker area inside the lounge but they have air where the lounge doesn't have air conditioning. The attendant from the lounge entrance made a joke saying that nobody complains about it, and by the way no worries she had a fan to ease up on the challenge. It seems that my country will be forever the bus station near a mountain of garbage. I personally think it is a shame to claim that we are part of Europe.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Antonio Ferreira,9/6/2010,"The new ""linha verde"" - green line was a very good improvement in this airport access; all the journey now takes about 35 minutes in express way. Even with more and more passengers increase month a month it's still lacking international 3 cities (Miami Lisbon and Panama City) are directly connected. The baggage claim is a problem: only 1 is located in international area (and is very small and you must wait a lot of time until you get your baggage).",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Belfast,airport,Margaret Kyle,6/16/2022,"In general the airport is tired and shabby and in urgent need of a total upgrade but I was really shocked at the poor standard of cleanliness at this airport. The ladies toilets throughout were awful. Granted we were flying out at a busy time, but arrived back at a quieter time in an evening. Many toilets were blocked, dirty and smelly!! No evidence of cleaning staff around, which is evident at most other airports. What a welcome to visitors from other countries!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Amsterdam Schiphol,airport,Francesca Muizelaar,9/2/2024,"Schiphol has numerous eGates, automatic self-service border checkpoints. It is easy to cross the border faster than with a manual inspection because you scan your own passport. YET, most of the time 50% or more of these are out of service generating long queues. How can this be? It is extremely ineffective and needs to be fixed! Otherwise, Schiphol is definitely one of the better European airports.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Baltimore Washington,airport,M Walker,1/3/2024,"My adult daughter had just returned from her connection in Las Vegas to Baltimore Airport in route to her final home destination in Maryland. My daughter had difficulty locating her car and had gotten on the wrong airport bus. Now normally this is frustrating for anyone, but my daughter is autistic so trying to problem solve while in a heightened emotional state is a big struggle for her. Morgan is higher functioning and prides herself on how independent she is, but after a night of flying across country and running to connection flights, she was feeling defeated and concerned about finding her vehicle as the sun was going down. A bus driver named Chris on bus 407 was her guardian angel. He went out of his way to get her to the correct bus before it got dark when the main office confirmed they were too swamped to assist. He even had to deal with an angry traveler yelling at him for taking the extra time of getting Morgan to the correct bus connection although Morgan said he was very efficient and quickly navigated her to the correct destination. Thank you Chris, your kindness is noticed and the world is a better place because of people like you!",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Jens Mueller,3/21/2005,Oldest airport that is still in use but great! The mother of all airports has an impressive architecture huge size and is very close to the city.

Unfortunately they want to close it in the next years but the building will not be destroyed.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,R Riley,12/15/2024,"We flew into Atlanta on a Delta flight from Paris with a connection (from Atlanta) to Orlando. Once off the plane it was easy to get to and complete passport control. However, all required interactions/processes beyond passport control were chaotic, loud, noisy, and rude. Specifically, - Part of the CBP process requires international arrival passengers to claim and then recheck luggage (if connecting). We waited at the assigned and posted carousel for over 30 minutes and then heard an unidentified person (employee?) yell out the bags for our flight were coming up two baggage claim carousels at the same time. How are passengers expected to know bags are coming in on the assigned carousel AND another carousel not posted for the flight? - After picking up checked bags, there was no posted guidance as to where to go or what to do. We rounded a turn and three separate airport employees were yelling three different sets of directions. One said to get into a particular line/queue but said nothing about checked luggage drop off. So we got in line. A separate employee came over yelling that our checked bags needed to be dropped across the room...no signage identified this and the only direction was to get in the line...so how would we know? - After sorting out the checked baggage drop, we went to another line for a security checkpoint. At the beginning of the line some unidentifiable airport employee was standing off to the side talking with people and it was not at all obvious she had anything to do with the security screening process. So, we proceeded into the line where other passengers were waiting. The employee then yelled something rude at my wife who was ahead of me. I asked the rude employee what she wanted. She said ""open your passports to the photo page."" So while fumbling with my passport and holding my carry-on, I asked ""why, the line is so backed up it will be 30 minutes until we get into the security checkpoint?"" The obnoxious rude employee then said ""you'll need to step aside"" and continued her side conversation with others. She then blurted out to other passengers ""ya'll can pass him by, I don't know what he be doing."" So the employee wanted people to open the passport but she was not looking at the passports and further did not appear to be in any way part of security, TSA, etc. Her uniform resembled cleaning crew. To make this worse, after opening the passports, the next employee just before the security checkpoint was instructing passengers to put the passports back in the bags with other items to clear security screening. -The security screening process was simple enough but employees were yelling with no clue that multiple people yelling means few instructions are understood and passengers are offended by their interaction. In a nutshell, many of the employees in Atlanta stand around barking instructions that cannot be understood. Many of these people should be replaced with signs like most modern airports have. Once beyond passport control Atlanta seems to have few signs or posted instructions as to what is required when arriving on an international flight with a domestic connection. Other airports around the world are far better at informing passengers and in my experience are less likely to be yelling at people like they are herds of cattle. Many employees at the Atlanta airport are unnecessarily rude if asked any questions or if asked to repeat whatever they are yelling. Avoid Atlanta if possible!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bonriki International,airport,18 reviewsGyan Fernando,11/24/2018,"Kiribati is a very small country and as expected the main airport (Bonriki, Tarawa) is very small. It is about the size of a very small warehouse but it was undergoing re-refurbishment. Being a very small airport, the staff were very friendly.

Bahrain,airport,A Zubairi,2/2/2023,Really beautiful airport after the renovations. All major fast food places available apart from local cuisine.

Bergen,airport,M McMillen,5/30/2023,Poor wheelchair assistance on departure and arrival. Departure was worse as I really needed a wheelchair to get me to the gate. Was told to wait at a particular spot and if no one showed by 3 PM that I should probably try to make it on my own. Well 3 PM came and I hobbled as best as I could to the gate. I have traveled extensively and used wheelchair services for more than 10 years in multiple airports both domestic and international. I have never received such poor service. Never traveling to this airport again.,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,airport,E Malton,6/30/2024,"Great airport, but it is huge and can take up to 25 minutes to get from gate to gate if in transit. Good variety of shops and restaurants, lots of toilets which are always clean. It's a shame there's no areas to relax apart from at gates. Singapore, Doha, KL etc all have sofa areas and big TV's to watch, which is great when you have a long lay over. I always thought there were smoking rooms here, but weren't. Not an issue if you have a lay over of more than 5hrs as you can go through immigration and leave the airport. I did, however, find cigarette butts behind floor standing AC units on two occasions at un-manned gates, where passengers and probably staff hide and have a quick smoke. I even smelt cigarette smoke at one point, so people obviously are smoking in the terminals. Some staff seemed quite unhelpful and stand-offish though when I asked about a few things, but mainly young ones who were more interested in what was on their mobile phones.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Beirut,airport,S Madein,6/25/2022,"Beirut is one of the worst airports ever witnessed. The official staff are rude and disrespectful especially those at the passport sections. You wait for sometimes an hour to get thru passports. You complain but nothing every gets corrected. Very unhelpful staff whether it is customs, passports or even local airline staff. I have never seen such an unorganized airport in my life. One can put up with a lot of things but for officials to treat you with disrespect is totally unacceptable. For a devastated bankrupt country that relies on tourism they have a long way to go in getting their entry and exit places up to spec. Horrible airport.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Brussels Charleroi,airport,Zhana Gulova,2/6/2025,"Avoid Brussels Charleroi Airport at All Costs! Every time I travel through Brussels Charleroi Airport, I face unnecessary trouble caused by the staff. The security personnel are shockingly aggressive, treating passengers with hostility instead of professionalism. The staff at the check-in and service counters are just as bad—rude, unhelpful, and completely indifferent to passengers’ needs. My most recent experience was the worst yet. I was aggressively treated by a security officer, which is absolutely unacceptable. To make matters worse, when I arrived in Varna, I discovered that the protective covering of my suitcase was missing—something I am certain happened at Charleroi. It is disgraceful that such an international airport operates with this level of unprofessionalism. I strongly advise travelers to avoid this airport if possible!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Belgrade,airport,V Korvan,11/9/2024,"The experience at this airport is highly unpredictable. A once-friendly environment can turn completely unfriendly, particularly at the transfer desk managed by the operator Menzies. On two separate occasions, due to inability to issue a boarding pass to the final destination at the departure airport, I was forced to deal with them. The service was disastrous — unprofessional, arrogant, and unfriendly. Despite having three people behind the counter, only one appeared to be working. One staff member redirected passengers to a nonexistent line while visibly stressed by the mere presence of customers, as it interrupted her phone-checking. Meanwhile, the other employee was busy arranging a massage over the phone. This level of service is unacceptable.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bermuda,airport,Bertram Forbes,1/29/2007,Bermuda's airport and Bermuda generally could be much more a pleasurable experience if it's government got rid of some nasty aspects of Bermuda for American British Canadian and European tourists. I refer to the mere $100 in duty-free allowances it offers its own residents compared to $800 allowed in the USA - and only $35 allowed by Bermuda in duty- free allowances to tourists. These token allowances are cheap and nasty make the government look greedy and uncaring are rigorously applied and when residents or visitors bring in more a 30% duty applies.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bagdogra,airport,Amullya Rai,3/13/2021,The worst airport I've ever been to. Small and always crowded. Limited amenities and a hassle to go through the security check. But scratch all that cause that is not the actual reason why this airport sucks the posterior like an industrial grade vacuum pump drawing water in the centre of the Sahara desert during the hottest day of a drought caused by divine retribution. The reason why this airport is totally annoying is because the ground staff have no idea how to provide service. No clue whatsoever. It's as if these airline companies purposefully choose their worst dolts to represent them in the most unprofessional way possible. They think of themselves as some celebrities who are entitled to your subservience since they work at the airport. It's like a really really bad joke. You wonder what is going on in the their minds while the try their utmost to make your life harder in whatever way possible. I despise having to use this airport but I have no choice since it's the closest one from where I live.

Ajaccio,airport,O Beyr,10/20/2008,Nice little airport right next to the sea and beaches. There is not much you can expect during waiting time it is only a regional airport.

Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Albuquerque,airport,Amy Dees,1/7/2021,"Avoid American Airlines at this airport. I have had horrid customer service in December 2020 and January 2021. I had a female ticketing agent charge me $170 for 1 overweight bag (54 lbs) because she claimed my husband's military orders were dated in March. Orders aren't posted the month you transfer ma'am. As a 17 year active duty wife, I may know a thing or two. Then said ""just because you are a military dependent doesn't mean you get free luggage"". I never in my life have experienced such horrid disrespect. On top of it I am a COVID crisis relief RN. I was blown away and have since vowed to never fly American again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,11/18/2013,Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal. One walks up a sort of sideways V shaped ramp to get to one's plane (I think they may offer use of umbrellas if it rains).,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Brussels Charleroi,airport,M Kouzi,5/11/2024,"Extremely poor quality of services, if non existent at all. My family and I had to wait at the luggage belt for more than an hour after arrival from EU. There was no assistant or supervisor around. I have been flying from/to Brussels Charleroi airport for years and it is becoming worse and worse. The premises are dirty, the toilets are filthy, with a few of them not flushing. What is audacious is the fact that one has to pay 1 EUR to be able to use them. In addition, there are no trolleys (there have never been) to help travellers carry their heavy and voluminous luggage to the parking. Overall, the worst airport.

I watched hundreds of flyers standby and watch their flight times pass by as the line stayed stagnant taking just over two hours to even get to baggage check. From an operational standpoint - Atlanta's airport should be momentarily shut down and reorganized. They need to up their headcount severely and while replacing operational leadership to more experienced individuals who are capable of getting security wait times below 2 hours. Truly an embarrassing organization where critical thinking goes to die. No other business or operation could survive with this leadership and conduct.

Cagliari,airport,Luca Carboni,9/23/2006,This is my home airport. Completely renewed a few years ago it's now a very good and modern airport. Near the city center (just 5 minutes by car). It's a small airport but it's probably the better choice to come to Sardinia. Depending on winds you can have a fantastic view over the famous sardinian beaches from your airplane window. In the summer sometimes you may find crowds at security checks. There are just a few overpriced shops but this is common in italian airports.

Berlin Tegel,airport,Tim Leborgne,2/24/2020,I believe Tegel is one of the worst airports I have visited in Europe.

Ballina Byron,airport,G Bray,6/6/2015,This is a small domestic airport that has outgrown it's small terminal by a long way. It strains to handle anything more than two aircraft at a time. When I arrived there were 3 planes trying to be turned around in the same hour. Arriving passengers packed out the baggage hall with their friends and relatives while departing passengers filled up every other space in the airport. The queue through security went out the terminal door resulting in some passengers mistaking this as a line for check in and missing the check in cut off time limit but thankfully airport staff allowed them to still check in with the chaos. Beyond the single security point it was standing room only. With only two gates side by side more confusion occurred at people lined up for the wrong aircraft because of snaking lines in the small space. A new terminal which is planned but not going to be built for some time it can not come quick enough.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Many places to eat-local, Starbucks, KFC. They don't seem to use jetways even though they were present and I was on an early morning mainline flight.

Finding a taxi was not obvious but a friendly airport employee walked us across the car park to the taxis - make sure you agree a price in advance. When we departed Abuja although it was quiet and there was no one in front it still took an hour to check-in. Bags had to be x-rayed and PAX go through a metal detector bags then manually weighed and manually searched after which we could check- in. Due to a computer crash boarding cards were manually written - however ground staff later gave out printed cards at the gate. The business lounge was rubbish but at least the sofas were comfy.

Belfast,airport,Brandon Ferris,1/7/2023,"I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews of this airport but I wanted to reassure people that the airport is not as bad as it seems. Most of the travel crisis in July 2022 was not the airports fault. Yes it is slightly run down but the service was excellent and it serves as a good base for EasyJet and Jet2. Security was a breeze and Jet2 queues were non existent. I actually found the toilets clean and the airport was clean with clear signs to the gate and there was no delays. I am sorry if you had a bad experience during the travel crisis but with more airlines joining in 2023 I can only assume the airport will improve. Jet2 has 24 locations from Belfast. I found it clean, convenient and will travel again with Jet2 next year. Staff were polite, even when I accidentally left my aftershave in my hand luggage going through security. They gave me a plastic bag to put it in and were friendly with me. I’ve never had any problems with the airport. The other thing is, the Northern Ireland economy isn’t Dubai economy, so it’s not like you are walking into Dubai International with Etihad Airways and expecting everything to be made of glass. Belfast City may be more efficient for short haul flights, but Belfast International has more destinations overseas. I think for an airport in Northern Ireland with the current economy, Belfast International is actually an excellent airport despite the reviews. It’s probably best to bear in mind, Dublin Airport and London Heathrow Airport faced the same kind of issues as Belfast when it came to delays, so Belfast isn’t the odd one out. It probably gets more of a bad reputation just because it’s slightly run down. But I think it’s excellent and is set to improve. I have heard reports of vomit on the floor and rude staff, but perhaps that was sorted by the time I was travelling. Many external factors meant there was delays and issues. It could do with being updated and prices reduced but apart from that it is excellent. I don’t have a photo but the lounge looks first class! I would highly recommend this airport and would give it 5 stars all the way considering the issues it faces were not it’s fault, it’s just got a worse reputation than it actually deserves! Airport Hotel nearby means it’s efficient and there are plenty of car parking spaces too! Brilliant! Would highly recommend this airport!",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

Bergen,airport,Peter Thackray,12/13/2016,"A relatively small but busy airport serving a key city on the coast of Norway. Most flights are domestic within Norway. Domestic Arrivals mix with departures and there are 2 baggage belts on the ground floor behind the check-in desks, no specific separation between general public and flying public. On the ground floor there are 2 convenience shops selling snacks, drinks etc and a small café/bar. The Check-in is predominantly self-service with very few staff evident. Upstairs to Security and Departures. The main domestic departures has a few food outlets, a book shop and a convenience shop, there is a further section for International Travellers with full Duty Free options. Most planes land at a gate with pier so little need to be outside. No announcements or ""Last Calls"" are made so you need to look at one of the many monitors to check your flight status.

In Schiphol it has become normal for passengers to have to wait for over an hour to collect their luggage, luggage is often damaged by the handlers in that airport, security screening is horrendous, the toilets are dirty, the staff are obnoxious and rude.

You have to queue with everybody in order to get your boarding pass even if you only have hand luggage. Ground personnel very slow until the call was made to invite people for boarding.

After scanning boarding ticket I went to bag security check that is maybe 5min away. There I needed to scan my boarding pass again when giving my bag. Not really efficient in my opinion. But my problems started when I was waiting for gates to announce. The gates was announced 45min before the flight and to go to the gates I need to pass passport security. And there my fun begin. I was waiting in the line for 20min. And than the security guy who was checking my passport and who barely spoke English told me to move in the side of the line to serve others. He had issue with my passport I have for almost a year and passport I used to arrive in the country. I gave my id to confirm my identity. But instead of letting me through he started to scan each page with UV light and checking each page in the scanning system. He started to scratch my passport with a nail and drop my id to see how its lands. My mother come back checking what take me so long because the airplane company already announced the last call. When like 5min left the manager come, check my passport for 1min and let me pass. I was the last one boarding. I wonder what would happen if they would keep me longer without explanation. Would I need to purchase a new flight ticket because the passport security guy didn't like my passport and id I arrived in the country and been using before to travel to the country.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Belize,airport,S Barton,3/7/2025,Unwelcoming airport with poor customer services.

It has looked like an ongoing building site for years. Access poor - hideously expensive quick drop off car park. The 20 min free car park is just far enough away to mean you cannot get to the terminal and back before having to pay. The check in queues seem to be everywhere. The escalators are intermittently out of service. The signage is poor or non existent in places. One of the few airports I have been through recently where you still have to pay for a trolley not that you would be able to push one through the crowds. There is not enough seating in the duty free area. It is hardly every possible to get on a plane without going through a basement holding are to get on an overcrowded bus to be taken practically to the other side of the airport. On arrival you are invariably also put on a bus and taken to a little flight of stairs like a trademan's entrance. This is a shocking way to welcome visitors to the UK.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,S James,3/18/2018,"The arrival process at this airport post passport control is truly, truly awful.

On one section of the compulsory entry form I was shouted at for not completing the section on how many children were accompanying me. When I said I had none, and that if this was the case the form said to pass on to the next section the customs lady shouted at me and told me to complete it anyway. Residents and visitors alike are treated with equal disdain - unless of course you pay for a porter or private pre-arranged fast track.

It’s so bad you want to come 8 hours early just so you have a moment to ask to speak to someone higher because it’s so bad they deserve to know the disrespect the travelers that help pay their salaries are just sick of it! I travel too much to be spoken to or watch other people be spoken to like dogs! Never in any airport in this country or outside of this country have I come across the sheer disrespect I have in Atlanta! If it were easier to drive to a whole other state to leave from I would.

Brasilia,airport,Rob Brook,8/21/2012,Arrival from Lisbon - long queues for non-Brazilian passport holders at Immigration and then again at Customs after baggage pick-up. Only one person checking everyone from an A340 plane (it took over an hour) so decided not to line up but sit down and wait it out. At least there is a small shop to relieve the tedium. Bring a good book. Plenty of taxis outside to take you into the city. Mine was metered so the fare was as expected. Departure on an internal flight to Sao Paulo. Check in was rapid and lines at security not too bad. But eat outside in the pleasant concourse before you go through security. There is only one small snack stand (that we could find) on airside and the seating area waiting for the transfer bus is small and crowded. No wi-fi either. Essentially many parts of the airport seem not to have expanded with increased traffic. How this airport will cope with the crowds attending World Cup 2014 can only be imagined.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

I was just passing through, in transit from Cairo to Copenhagen and I’ve never been treated this badly at an airport before. I was singled out and stopped for hours after leaving the airplane and treated like a suspect for no apparent reason. After hours of questioning they finally let me go with the explanation that it’s normal procedure for anyone travelling to Europe! Which is a lie as I saw others pass through with no interrogation, and I’ve traveled back and forth to Europe from many other destinations without any trouble before and especially not when in transit. After they let me go I had to show my passport to every staff member that I passed through and they were all rude and unprofessional. The airport was too small and lacked many facilities, seating area was too crowded. The wifi was almost non existent and their coffee prices and food was too expensive and tasteless!

I explained i'm transiting to LHR an that I have 2 hours until my next flight leaves i should have been able to walk through the first security queue. He then demands i join the back of the 2nd queue (approx 200 people) while the people from my flight walk through security in the 1st queue. I explained again, i'm going to be late for my flight but was ignored completely! 1 hour later he then merges both queues together to speed things up. So, what was causing the delay? 1 man in security with no magnifying glasses or machinery going through liquids under 100ml looking for specific ingredients! What's worse! By the time we get to this point he's trying to chat up my wife! This is the worst airport i have transited in! Never again! The staff are rude and are not interested in helping/listening. They don't know what customer service is! nor how to operate an airport. There is a lot of learning that need to happen here. I highly recommend you don't transit through Amman if you don't want to lose your sanity.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Cagliari,airport,S Shaw,9/14/2020,"The only complaint is the lack of logic in boarding flights. In COVID time would be ideal to board from seat number starting from the back of the plane in order to avoid contact with people seating in front rows. In Cagliari don’t seem to know at all this method that we have experienced at Heathrow airport and Fiumicino airport as well. We tried to suggest it to the airport staff doing the boarding but they seem clueless and helpless. Big crowd gathering at the same time with no proper queue and security distance. I wish a manager at Cagliari airport would have the kindness to reply and explain why. It would be so easy to update the system and believe me, the boarding will be quicker and safer. Thank you.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

A ramp had been put in at the rear of the plane for her to get off of by way of a wheel chair. Young lad by the name of Oliver was her helper in this. Walked us through passport and customers. He asked where we were parked. I had 2 cases and 2 small bass on a trolley. He took us all the way to where our car was parked.

Bahrain,airport,3 reviewsC Han,2/19/2023,"The terminal offers an array of restaurants and shops, which gives passengers a well rounded experience. The security was smooth and quick with just only a few passengers waiting in line. The airport has a very white theme which makes the interior very bright. Staff at the airport are generally helpful and able to speak basic to intermediate level of English. I had troubles connecting to the WiFi network. I asked the airport staffs to help me out because they couldn't figure out the reason of not being able to connect the WiFi.

In fact, although small, I found it large enough not to be claustrophobic, with clean and spacious toilet facilities, and mercifully adequately air conditioned. Not many shopping or eating options, but how much do you really need on a short layover? The staff seemed engaged and friendly. Before flying I consulted the government's website for the airport, but it was pretty poor - the site was very so old-fashioned and extremely short on useful information. There were more details from passenger forums.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Bangalore,airport,1 reviewsBruce Lyman,8/27/2024,"The new international terminal is a nice building but the traveller experience was awful. I should add it was not just our experience but the same as others caught in the same ridiculous situation. We had arrived via a domestic flight (Indigo) which was seven hours before our international departure. We were bused to the new international terminal and told we could not enter the building because our flight didn't open for another four hours. The expectation was that we would wait on the kerb where there are no amenities, for four hours. Bureaucratic nonsense and bad experience one. After pressing the security staff we were eventually allowed into the ticketing foyer. But we were not allowed into the terminal proper and had to wait there for four hours where there are no amenities for transiting passengers. We had boarding passes for our international connections but were not allowed into the airport proper where we could make use of cafes and the lounges and bathrooms. Bad experience two - waiting in a hall not designed for waiting passengers. And not just ourselves but numerous other transit passengers as well. A nice building let down but business processes that make no sense. Worse, when I attempted to email management (feedback emails advertised everywhere) they blamed the airlines for not aligning their flights! That was really poor form. If you have a poor business process (and you do) don't blame someone else for it - solve it. The management team here need to look at every other half decent terminal around the world to see how it's done. Singapore. Bangkok. KL. Dubai.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

The body search officer (female) was unable to communicate that she wanted 3 women inside the search area, at the same time, obviously I had no idea that's what she wanted because nothing like that has ever happened before. You call one woman inside, get one done and then the other one enters the cubicle. She pulled me inside, checked two other women in front of me and then it was my turn. This was definitely not normal behaviour. Extremely disgusted and upset. This was my fifth visit to Baghdad and the first time anything like this has ever happened.

They will show you 20 Euros in coins and ask for a note in exchange. They are expert at a sleight of hand confidence trick. You will not get the correct change once they count it out for you. 2) There is a cafe on the first floor of international departures that is open 24x7 and is the only non-airside seating area. Particularly useful if your flight is delayed and are awaiting check in to open. 3) The Duty Free was open until 0100 am for the Air France Paris flight 4) I flew Kenyan Airlines to Nairobi, this was a flight originating in Mozambique or Reunion but assigned seat was not available as the transiting passengers were already stretched out over all seats.

Berlin Tegel,airport,Hoi Wong,12/7/2019,"Me and my family just arrived today and had the worst experience ever in the Berlin Tegel airport. First of all, the queue of immigration was terribly long and we waited for an hour and a half just to go through immigration. Once we got through the immigration me and my brother got our baggage but my mum’s baggage went missing, so we waited till there was no baggage on the belt anymore. I called the “missing or damaged baggage” but no one picked up. Then I saw staff with a bright green vest so I went to her for help. But the answer she gave me was: missing baggage is not my area, don’t ask me is not my business, then she walked away quickly. I was standing there feeling helpless then I saw the sign of baggage service, so me and my family went there for help. The staff there asked me to fill in a form and wait till they have any news. We are really worried so I ask her when exactly can we get back our baggage, she replied she didn’t know. We felt the answer she gave was really unhelpful so we went to the customer service counter, I told the guy at the desk that my mum has health issues and all of her medicine is in the baggage, then he replied that’s not his problem because my mum shouldn’t have put the medicine in that bag in the first place. He was really rude and judgemental since the reason my mum didn’t take the medicine out of the bag is that the cabin bag was supposed to be taken onboard by herself but the easyJet staff told her that the plane has not got enough space so they had to check in her cabin bag. My mum has all of her heart medicine, sleeping pills and antidepressant in her baggage. Now my mum might have to fly back to the UK since she has been in serious health condition for over 10 years.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Airport staff will make your life hell just to say your last good byes to family. My Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi was slightly delayed coming into the airport due to a power cut! I have never experienced anything like it! My arrival into the airport was just as bad with airport staff wanting to open all bags and wanting bribes in order to keep things.

Amritsar,airport,A Anderson,4/28/2017,This is a small and quiet airport. The aerobridges are still not in use which is cumbersome for families travelling with children and disabled people. The buses used to transfer to the terminal are jerky so again elderly and small children need to be careful. The luggage arrived with in 40 minutes except baby pram which was delayed by 2 hours as they treat it as a luggage. It was really stressful for us as we were waiting for a good 2 hours for our pram after a 14 hour flight and on the top of it they asked for money / bribe as they had to carry it from airside as it can damage the luggage belt. The immigration is bit slow at this airport and make sure that they have stamped the correct arrival year on your passport as some passengers passports were stamped for 2016. They may harass you for their own deliberate mistakes at the time of departure because stays exceeding 180 days as per Indian Immigration rules have to get the exit stamp from local police station or FRO.

Albury,airport,W Harding,6/14/2016,Albury is a pleasant airport. The staff are kind and knowledgeable. There are 5 gates - 4 departure and 1 arrival.

The airlines that you need to go through security for are Qantas and Virgin Australia but not Regional Express. The terminal is clean especially the toilets. The café is overpriced but the food is ok. The only shopping in the terminal is the café. Unlike most airports it is almost impossible to get lost in ABX. The only drawback is that to get to and from the terminal to or from the plane you have to walk across the tarmac. Out of all the airports I have been to ABX has been the best.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

This airport is an excellent option for passengers travelling to or from the southern part of the former East Germany or to the north of Bavaria (I live in Bamberg and the drive is much shorter and more pleasant than to the next nearest Ryanair airport at Frankfurt Hahn).

Accra Kotoka,airport,K Teague,9/21/2018,"Beautiful state of the art equipment but some poor organisation despite lots of friendly staff. Nobody tells you the procedure, join this queue then shuffle along only to be told you should have gone to the luggage weigh-in queue first. Weigh luggage then rejoin back of check in queue. Told to go to security, shuffle along for a bit then someone asks for departure card. Leave security queue, go to desk where you collect and fill departure card then rejoin back of security queue. Suggest check in desk staff give you a departure card so you will know to fill it in before going through security. Takes a while to shuffle through that and go through immigration departure check then security check. All took about one and a half hours. At gate we were divided into groups 1-5. Not enough seats for group 5 although most passengers are in this group. Infrastructure is very impressive and no doubt they will eventually streamline procedures. Sign posting would be a good start. Shopping and dining facilities are mostly not yet open so I cannot comment on this aspect yet. So, first taste of new terminal: not half bad.

Bradley,airport,G Bartel,6/21/2022,"Hartford airport is very small - I arrived 2 hours before my flight because I was coming from Vermont and wanted to allow for traffic, but that was way too early for what was available at the airport. The hall immediately past security has plenty of restaurants to choose from, along with a number of rocking chairs that have a nice view of the apron. The Gates 1-12 concourse also looked like it had been recently renovated and also had a nice selection of restaurants and shops. However, the pre-security areas and the Gates 20-30 concourse were dark and dim, and were unpleasant places to wait. Fortunately, everything at this airport is very close, so if your flight leaves from Gates 20-30 you can wait in the post-security hall and go to your gate at the last moment. Still, it'd be nice if the airport would renovate the Gates 20-30 concourse and the pre-security areas so that it looks as nice as the Gates 1-12 concourse.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

Algiers,airport,9 reviewsAndre Bouzid,10/28/2015,"Arrival from London was fine but the immigration hall was packed and it took a bit of time to get through. Baggage claim is always a nightmare at Houari Boumidienne airport (Algiers) because everyone has so many huge bags and the system isn't very efficient. Connections to the city are ok but we got a taxi. On the way back, check in had a very long line. But since we had online check-in, they allowed to go into Club Europe's queue though the way the agents work so lethargically, it wasn't much quicker. Immigration was smoother than on arrival. Security was separated by gender which annoyed some less conservative Algerians. I have to say we got the timing spot on as we were able to buy some Algerian wine and after a few minutes, we were boarding. But then, there is more security after the boarding gate which slows everything down as the X-ray kept breaking. What I personally don't like about Algiers airport is that there is so much ""security"" when in fact, the officers behind the screen are just chatting and laughing, barely looking at the screen. Overall, it is an ordinary airport with nothing particularly good but not bad either.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

Billund,airport,Christian Britten,9/17/2009,Billund is an excellent airport with good facilities practical layout and friendly and efficient staff.

I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away. As the airport is far from where most foreign travellers want to be (unless they really like Lego) you often have little option but to wait for the bus or pay even more for a taxi.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Buffalo,airport,Robert Isenhart,8/22/2024,"This airport is horrible, they don't accept cash. Read the notes, it's legal tender. What a rotten rule,is this the USA or not. Whoever made these rules is a complete fool. Insensitive elite losers. Many people use cash we don't want to be taken advantage of by these banks and institutions that hate people.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Almaty,airport,S Baltanek,12/16/2021,"Almaty airport international departure lounge is only one hall, where everyone on all flights is jammed together. Extremely small space. The cafeteria available there are horrible to put it best, there is a Starbucks with very few tables. The cleanliness is substandard. Try not going to the toilets if you can: it is just a psychologically traumatic experience: the smell is horrible, not clean, often no paper towels available, the soap dispensers are just unpleasant to touch. Business class lounge at Almaty Airport is a huge scam, do not go there. It has very small space, poorly ventilated, all airlines crammed into one room, and the scam is that they charge for everything there, including for water, at overpriced rates. The security procedure is ridiculous. The passport control check passport and checks the face matches passport. The security check is roughly 10 meters after passport control, where there is a separate counter with someone checking passport and asking to show face. Now, the funniest part is that right after the counter, literally after taking 3-5 steps, there is another person who asks to show passport and checking the face again. I am not joking, this is seriously being done by people at the airport, literally three separate passport and face checks within 20 meters. Almaty Airport is a disgrace, shame to the country and to beautiful city of Kazakhstan.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bari Palese,airport,Claudia Erath,4/5/2022,"Arrival security check took a while. However departure was nice and easy and only took 1 min. Was worried we would not have enough time, but was all good. No queues and plenty of cafes and shops airside.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,Klaus Malling Olsen,3/7/2016,"During rush-hours (evening) Kotoka Airport felt very crowded, but check-in was surprising quick, as well as security check, this works well if you arrive at least 3 hours before departure. Rush hours here mean departure within half an hour for several wide-body plans, creating a severe lack of seating and extremely long rows of slowly boarding passengers, making you realize that you are in a far too small airport to handle several aircrafts with a capacity of 3-400 passengers within a short time limit. Thi is especially the case when you arrive. The rows of arriving passengers at the immigration was long enough to last for almost one hour, and was followed by usual slow deliverance of luggage. Furthermore, the staff controlling the yellow cards for vaccinations are not very well inset in the rules, including the knowledge that persons over a certain age are not required vaccination against yellow fever. However, as a whole Kotoka was not too bad an experience, just accept some more time than required in more updated and modern airports.",NEUTRAL,POSITIVE

Agadir Al Massira,airport,Dawn Mohammad,6/30/2017,Awful. Nearly 2 hours to get out of Agadir Airport on arriving. Departure took 3 hours. Never have I been to such a disorganized airport. Security had no queue system on arrival or departure. My transport to my hotel waited 2 hours and cost a small fortune because of the wait. I actually needed more than 4 hours on departure. Never again. I usually fly to Marrakesh and travel to Agadir but this time I could not find a bus to connect with the flight so I flew direct. Big mistake - rude staff not helpful at all. Only good thing is the smoking area inside airport. A horrible experience.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Inside it is clean but lacks better signaling.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Barcelona,airport,Jason Birch,10/31/2024,"Absolutely awful. Be prepared for the longest walks imaginable, rude uninterested employees, ridiculous lines, awful and rude passport control, and bring an air conditioner because it is so hot in this airport it is insane. After what seemed like a mile walk to my gate, none of the chargers work in the “charging seating area”. I am the only one here. I arrived 4 hours early. Walked around to try to find a place to charge my phone. Tried adaptors, plain usb, usb-c, nothing. I’ve lever left a review before cause honestly I never cared enough, but I had to for this airport.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Bremen,airport,Eric Decamps,9/6/2015,"Nothing special to write, it looks more like a train station than an airport but it's a small city anyway so that's fair. Access from the city center by tram makes it the easiest, cheapest and fastest airport to reach I've seen in my life. Fans of space will love the huge International Space Station model in the main hall and aviation fans will love the souvenir shop where you can buy many Airbus collector's items. One thing: they should put more power sockets.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

Barcelona,airport,Emily Curran,7/27/2024,"I took a flight on Air Senegal from Dakar to Barcelona and was meant to transit in Barcelona to Dublin. My bag did not arrive in Barcelona, and due to long immigration lines I missed my flight to Dublin. I rebooked a flight for that evening, and then spent the entire day tracking down each of the four luggage carriers in Barcelona airport; all of them claimed to not work with Air Senegal, and kept sending me back to each other. I went back and forth from Terminal 1 to 2 repeatedly, and when I asked for help at information kiosks the staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful, acting as if it was an inconvenience for them to provide information, which is their job. I was in tears after a few hours of this. Each luggage carrier claimed that they don’t work with Air Senegal so they would not allow me to fill in a declaration form, which is needed for the lost luggage to be entered in the system. I also was unable to claim the insurance on my lost bag that I had prepaid for because they would not allow me to fill the declaration form. The only luggage carrier that was helpful was Avia Partner; there were two staff there who were really lovely and the male staff member even helped me to fill a declaration form manually. Unfortunately a manual form does not enter the loss into any systems, it just documents that I was there. I called Barcelona Airport repeatedly after finally arriving in Dublin and the Barcelona Airport staff refused to help me once again. I still have no idea where my bag is one month later. While this is a shared problem between Air Senegal and Barcelona Airport, I felt that I was not treated respectfully by the majority of staff in the airport and overall it was an awful experience of which I hope does not happen to anyone again. If anyone finds a large red suitcase lying around Barcelona Airport, please let me know. I would seriously consider switching airports if you can on your trip and avoid Barcelona completely. I hope I never have to set foot in that airport again, and I sincerely hope that one day my bag will be found.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Addis Ababa,airport,Gulnar Manji,1/6/2024,"This is one of the most chaotic airports I’ve ever had the experience of being in. We were a family with a child in transit to Dar Es Salaam. On departure to Dar there were several gates and hundreds of people lined up in a corridor of 6-8 feet while other passengers waking up and down the same aisle pushing and shoving as there wasn’t room. Transfer buses were so unorganized with no one giving clear directions and people were pushing and shoving to get to the bus. On our return to Toronto, the security checks were so crowded, it was a shamble, and trays for shoes, purses took forever to come, and when a few trays came everyone tried to grab them creating such chaos. We had to go through security twice and body search!. On our way to gate A16 we had to go through the body scanner. My son was holding his three year old child and the security staff attempted to grab the child so only the father would be scanned. My son put his child down and told the security staff not to touch him yet the staff tried to grab the child and seeing a stranger the child of course started crying. When I told the female staff I would report them she rudely said to me go ahead and refused to give me her name and turned her badge around so I could not see the name. Just going through this airport was not only stressful but frustrating.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Brussels Charleroi,airport,1 reviewsMarc Harris,9/28/2024,"Really not sure what all the hate and negativity is about. Through security in six minutes. Through border control in two minutes. Loads of seats. Really good quality restaurants and bars which weren’t an absolute rip off. Toilets are only pay toilets before departures. Then all free, assume due to stop people wandering in and using. Sat by gate 25 now for a full flight back to Manchester and all is fine. Was proper worrying before but it’s been a pleasure. Only negative was went in wrong car park dropping the hire car back, but that my my fault.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Astana,airport,Jack Sheldon,11/2/2006,Small ultramodern terminal. Check-in was fairly efficient except for flatheads who queue-jumped. In the end I had to spread my elbows to get attention. Business-class desk not manned. Unable to check-in bags or myself to connecting flights (even on the same airline). There’s not a great deal to do in the airport whilst waiting for flights. Once airside all there is is a small bar. In theory the terminal is non- smoking though there is a separate smoking room but the whole terminal smelt of smoke most of the time I was there.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Batumi,airport,Zeyad Gh,1/7/2020,"Very bad, too long waiting in checking, I waited more than two hours to check in while they checked my small bag. It took so long and I was all the time not knowing what they were doing.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Broome,airport,Joshua Smith,10/11/2005,Nice little airport. Size is adequate for the small number of flights a day. Departures and arrivals are separate buildings so it is quick to check-in and collect baggage. Departure hall is basically a pergola with a shop and a bar but it's fine. On arrival you get free trolleys which is a bonus.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

Overall it is a much less stress free and agreeable experience in comparison to transit through Doha or Dubai.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Anchorage,airport,M McManus,10/16/2011,Went to Anchorage in late 2011. Airport has some restaurants on the security side of the airport but not a good choice and the quality was not too good. The gift shops on the other hand are excellent especially if you are looking for Native American art. Be warned that quite a few souvenirs are like snow shakers with water which will be taken off you by security if you need to pass through them again. Information screens were useful. Plenty of seating and quite a view out of the terminal window.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Aalborg,airport,Paul Van Alsten,5/22/2011,AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Aalborg,airport,S Kroes,2/13/2013,This is a nice and modern airport at the moment they are expanding the airport so there is a lot of building going on but in the departure area you will not notice this very much. The Airport has got free Wifi and a small restaurant with shop on the land side. Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Belfast City,airport,M Harrison,1/9/2019,"Thumbs up for Belfast City Airport. Excellent revamp. New improved security area. Bigger Duty Free Shop - not sharing any space with other retail. Much more passenger seating. Good new bar, with charging points and a family / table service area. The views of the apron have not been compromised. This makeover is long overdue - now gives Belfast International a run for its money, and much more user friendly than London City, my final destination today.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Bournemouth,airport,Jayne Whittaker,1/14/2019,"Our Ryanair flight was late, we were ushered to the departure gate like sheep with comments of move along please when the aircraft had not even arrived! Made to stand for 1hr and 20 minutes a lot of this time outside, freezing cold. There was absolutely no reason that we could not have waited in relative comfort at the gate. The airport is small but so unorganised. Only 3 flights leaving at the time we departed, they couldn't even look after the customers that were there. I also flew into Bournemouth, arrived at 5pm, the arrivals Hall was absolutely freezing with no facilities and the main departure hall had not one place open to get provisions whilst awaiting collection. Truly terrible. If I could put zero for overall rating I would. Maybe OK for summer but avoid in winter. Will never use again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,S Adewale,3/3/2007,In Nigerian standards relatively clean and organized.

Berlin Brandenburg,airport,1 reviewsSilviu Ursu,6/19/2024,"Berlin Brandenburg (BER) is not probably, is definitely the worst airport I have ever been in more than 20 years of flying all over the world. It is an embarrassment to Germany with its stereotypical image of order, organization and respect. As many times the case, things are not always as they are marketed/sold, but here the gap is truly wide. In my ranking of over 200 airports I’ve been at, BER “excels” as the international airport with the most miserable/rude staff I have ever had to deal with, a definite 0/10. Probably never flying from here again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abidjan,airport,Simon Gooch,5/3/2016,"I have been through Abidjan a few times and whilst I was impressed on my first visit, progressive improvements since then mean that it is definitely the best airport I have been to in Africa.

Athens,airport,Mia Nielsen,6/25/2024,"This airport need to up their standards! Even though you check in and print your bag tag you still have to wait in line with everyone else, which kind of defeats the purpose. And the line moves so extremely slow. I’m sure the staff at the check in counters are lovely people but I have never seen anyone work slower. This resulted in a man from Aegean having to shout out for passengers to flights that were on closing because they couldn’t make it through the line on time. Then you finally get to security and here they have staff guiding you to the different security points but they seem to have no sense of which line is actually full - I was directed to the longest line. Overall not a good experience. Arrived to the airport at the estimated time but couldn’t even make it to my gate before they started boarding.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Almeria,airport,Susan Davis,7/18/2007,I found the airport to be more than adequate. We were there in July and it was busy but check in was OK as was security. The waiting area is small and there are not enough catering facilities but the roof top terrace was brilliant it was a pleasure to wait for the plane for once and you can have a cigarette in peace! The toilets were clean and tidy wastebins emptied frequently so all in all not a bad airport - have certainly spent time in much worse,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Antwerp Deurne,airport,S Smith,12/20/2009,Fantastic airport. I go in and out at least once a month. Yesterday I timed my arrival and from walking off the plane to being outside at a taxi was 43 seconds!!! 15 minute check in for departures.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Boa Vista,airport,1 reviewsDaryn Johnson,6/18/2015,"I personally really like this airport. It's small but does everything it needs to. It looks more like a sand castle than an airport but every time I've used it it's been easy to check in. Unfortunately there is no smoking area anywhere in the airport and considering a fair portion is non smoking I find that a bit strange. Also, once I was delayed and as there are no tannoy announcements you are left wondering about that status of your flight which if you've travelled TACV can be understood. However, if you're a resident of Cape Verde you do get used to the ""no stress"" mentality even if it can be frustrating sometimes. There's a bar either side of check in/customs and they serve snacks. There's also a small duty free shop but most airline's stock would be more comprehensive.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,A Frankowski,5/6/2016,"The new terminal at Antigua airport has only been open for a few months, and it is quite magnificent. It's up there with the best European airports, although not anywhere near as large. The 2 duty-free shops are amazing - particularly their rum selections which include Clement Rhum Agricole from Martinique and some genuine sugar cane syrup to mix it with. The souvenir shop also looked very good, although I didn't have enough time to look round it in great detail.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Iain Bagwell,8/29/2015,"Overall I like BHM. It's small, staff (at least at Delta check in and gate) are super friendly. The amenities are good for a small regional airport. Bags are usually quick to retrieve. My one gripe is parking. The parking deck is always almost very nearly completely full, so finding a space can often take as long as the short flight to connect in ATL. The one other thing that annoys me every time I do find a space is total lack of smart carts in the parking lots. Hey listen up Airport managers. This is an airport and customers travel with baggage. Don't you think it would be a great idea to facilitate this process of getting bags to terminals by offering a cart service in the parking lots?",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,Elizabeth Abraham,1/23/2025,This is a very modern airport but they have not thought through all details. There is no place for a non premium tired traveler to stretch their legs and relax. Many of the other supports I've been at have a reclining chair with possibility to stretch legs. Not all of us can afford the lounge or the on sure hotel. 130 usd for 4 hours! Also there are not enough phone and computer charging capabilities in this modern airport. Very disappointed.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Claire Baksa,12/13/2016,"This airport has the most ill mannered Customs Staff we have ever had the misfortune to encounter, border control staff represent their country and the visitors they meet are paying their salaries. We queued for over two and a half hours in the arrivals hall area. There were 3 immigration officers on duty the rest of the booths were empty, please review staffing levels. The officer who processed our forms was not friendly but that was acceptable he wasn't rude. Next were the female customs staff, we have never encountered anyone so openly hostile, rude, ill mannered officers at any airport and we are frequent travellers. One officer was marching up and down the line being openly aggressive, while the other one who checked your documents did not speak but pointed and clicked her fingers to communicate with you without eye contact. Meanwhile the redcaps were walking by with passengers and were exempt from this why? We will avoid this airport in the future this is not the face Barbados wants to present to the world, please re train or replace these individuals, meanwhile remind them that we (the visitors) are paying their salaries and treat the people they serve with some respect or at least basic manners.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Brasilia,airport,G Villela,4/8/2009,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice. But a light-rail line is planned for the next couple of years and that should improve things a lot.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Bangalore,airport,Dimpi Majumdar,3/12/2023,Only good thing about Bangalore airport terminal 2 is it is beautiful and clean. No other facilities available like other airports. It does not have much food stalls and shopping area near GATES. Moreover toilet are very far from gate location. Less seating areas.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Agadir Al Massira,airport,J Davidson,3/28/2018,The security checks at this airport in Agadir is over the top. Luggage checked twice and passport control 4 times. Don't they trust each other? One customs officer has to check the work of the other customs officer? And rows and rows of people trying to find the quickest lanes. Completely inefficient process. It took 2 hours to get through to the gate. I have traveled extensively and even India (in lots of chaotic situations) has a much better organisation. I can understand that security is important but this is absurd and a waste of my time.,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,A Anderson,5/21/2024,Spent the last two days and one night inside the airport. My husband went to several different bathrooms and he said they all smell like urine. Terrible like the guy mopping is just smearing all around. The women’s bathroom had dirty floors and pieces of trash lying around. Several of the toilets weren’t flushed. Food options are very limited. Bham is a foodie city and we should show that off to the world. Maybe allow local favorites to set up pop ups during the tourist seasons!! I could give you tons of recommendations as to who to invite and share their menus with travelers. Give them a true taste of Birmingham.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Asturias,airport,Roland Rodriguez,7/5/2010,Went to OVD on a day trip from BCN in mid June 2010 to visit family in nearby Castrillon. I seen the airport evolve for the last thirty years into a very nice compact and efficient operation. Everything is laid out in a logical sequence. You arrive into a small check-in area as there are still less than a half dozen or so carriers that use it go through a quick and orderly screening area and up to the gates. There are various shops to include a regional Asturias gift shop stores transportation outlets and the such. Public areas are clean and not crowded by any means. There is the typical cafe with lots of room and reasonable pricing. We found taxis right outside the terminal along with two bays for ALSA busses running to both Oviedo and Gijon. Be advised that the trip to the provincial cities of Oviedo Gijon and Aviles all take about a half hour or so to get to. All in all a very nice user-friendly airport.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

Aalborg,airport,M Andersen,8/7/2012,A very nice airy terminal - that seems modern enough. Free WIFI and free parking. Everything within walking distance.

My departure was from Terminal 2 and after entering it there was no place where I could get it. It is important that such things as sanitarny paper or diaper for babies are available to buy on an airport. It should be available in the toilet, or in one of the shops. I had to ask several women which were also waiting for a plane whether they have sanitary paper. It was uncomfortable. I found sanitary paper, cause one of the women had it, but I could be less fortunate.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Aalborg,airport,K Fischer,8/4/2010,Very quick check-in and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,9/8/2011,Bob Hope Airport as it is formally known is small and easy to navigate. Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus. You can also take one of the parking shuttles to the nearby Metrolink/Amtrak rail station.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Astana,airport,8 reviewsMaarten Caspers,12/23/2016,"Astana is a small international airport, that is well connected to Europe via Frankfurt, London, Paris and Amsterdam through Kazakhstan's Air Astana. The airport has only one terminal for Domestic and International flights. A new terminal is being constructed next to the existing facility which is planned to be opening in spring 2017. The arrivals and baggage reclaim is small. Immigration quite smooth and officers were friendly, but remember to fill in your immigration card with a blue or black pen, not with a red one as it is not accepted. I had almost no queues. Taxi pick-up at the terminal is not well-organised and taxi recruiters can be annoying. The central hall for departures is quite spacious and there is sufficient seating around the check-in area. Check-in areas are small and somewhat old-fashioned, but work fine. Friendly ground staff. Short queuing time at check-in, passport control and security. Emigration passport control is fine. There are few F&B and retail facilities at the international departure gates. There is plenty of seating at the end of the concourse close to the small cafe in the back. Transferring between international flights is quick and easy. Passengers do not have to pass immigration, only security screening. It took me only 5-10 minutes from arrival gate to departure gate. F&B and retail facilities are limited, especially in the departure are after immigration. Food choice is limited. Very good wifi while waiting for check-in or for your flight. Password can be obtained via SMS. Terminal and toilets are clean. Remote arrivals and departures (via bus) in winter when temperatures can go below -20 Celsius can be cold and slippery, but also a very interesting experience.

Bandung,airport,F Lakana,9/26/2019,"Bandung Airport is a quaint airport in the middle of the city (used to be the HQ of. Indonesia’s domestic aircraft industry, meanwhile non-existing). It served a number of domestic and international destinations and was a real asset to the city. Then the government decided to build a grand new airport in Majalenka, about 60 or so kilometres north of Bandung, which had to cater for a growing population in the Bandung area and East Jakarta. It was opened pretty much on schedule, which is rare in Indonesia, but in the middle of nowhere; far away from current populations and with poor connections. Since no airlines wanted to move there, the government forced the move of 56 domestic flights from Bandung to the new Kertajati airport. This included the popular Bandung- Bali routes. The result is that it now takes longer to get to the new airport (about 3 hours), than it actually takes to fly to Bali. Some people now prefer to drive all the way to Jakarta, for more choice and cheaper flights. Efforts are made to reinstate some domestic flights in Bandung, but that does not include the Bali route for the time being. Overall, such a shortsighted decision to move all these flights from Bandung to Majalenka.:. So; for as long as Bandung Airport remains an ‘empty shell’ in terms of domestic flights, I will have to give it a low rating.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Basel Mulhouse,airport,Vincent Menting,8/21/2024,"I have been using Basel airport for two decades and the service quality has been bad ever since. Compared to for instance Zurich staff are so rude and unfriendly at Basel. There is far too little terminal seating or staff will not let you use it. Toilet Cleanliness is an issue here as well. Shopping is overpriced and on and on. Anyway since then the quality level is pretty low over decades there is no expectation that improvement may be expected, nor does management show any interest in improvement.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bermuda,airport,Raymond Breland,4/20/2005,"Like Bermuda itself this airport is a thoroughly civilized experience - not very busy so not crowded with a rather predictable traffic pattern of arrivals and departures. Facilities are very adequate and the duty-free shop has a reasonable variety albeit a bit expensive. On entry customs officials are polite and welcoming. When checking in for our departing flight the official who had to ""pat me down"" for a follow-up security check (the machine beeped when I went through) apologized for having to do so and thanked me for accommodating the security process! All in all a refreshingly unique experience - one that is alas vanishing amid the all-too-common post 9/11 over-zealous and ironically ineffective security measures elsewhere - Bravo to Bermuda and its airport!!",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Banjul,airport,30 reviewsD Sarzen,4/13/2023,"First of all, plan on leaving very early as the road to the airport is always congested, after that being said, be prepared for some hassle. First you need to line up in order to pay a 20 USD or equivalent ""Development tax"", then the airline ""security"" will photograph your passport and all the stamps/visa in it, then you will be allowed to check in. After that, you will need to clear immigration, be prepared to have people jumping the queue in front of you and no one will say anything. Some officers want you to fill the departure form, others will let you go without it. Security line is fast as long as you do not have computers etc... inside the carry on. Do not shop in foreign currency at the duty free or you will be ripped off, if you need to exchange your last dalasis, you will be able to, but they will give you lots of coins, which for me was just fine. Blackouts are common at this airport, just saying. Boarding is chaotic, they do not respect the classes or groups, anything goes. People needing wheelchair will literally be carried by 3-4 men from the tarmac to the plane and be prepared to tip. The only thing that worked fine in here believe it or not was the WiFi, it was free and fast.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Anchorage,airport,M McManus,10/16/2011,Went to Anchorage in late 2011. Airport has some restaurants on the security side of the airport but not a good choice and the quality was not too good. The gift shops on the other hand are excellent especially if you are looking for Native American art. Be warned that quite a few souvenirs are like snow shakers with water which will be taken off you by security if you need to pass through them again. Information screens were useful.

Antalya,airport,N Carlan,9/5/2024,"Antalya airport is the most expensive airport I have ever been to. The prices are extortionate, for anything from the duty free to the various cafes and fast food restaurants, for the price you expect the food to be at least hot, the food was cold and stale. I just do not understand how they can charge so much for bad quality food. I understand airports are expensive but this was a different level of expensive. The rest of the airport is alright, easy to find where you’re going and helpful staff. You did have to go through double security once at the door and after you check in your luggage, so be mindful to not buy any drinks from downstairs. Also there is no airport WiFi you have to pay. Overall I will not be returning to Antalya because even outside of the airport prices are extortionate and vendors do not know how to trade in their own currency of lira. Everything is in Euros.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Beauvais,airport,S Hunter,9/25/2024,"Having spent far too much time of my trip to Paris looking at reviews of BVA and becoming convinced that I'd definitely miss my flight/my luggage would be pulled apart/I'd have to stand for 4-5 hours with no rest, to say I was pleasantly surprised by my airport experience would be an understatement. Beauvais is a hub for budget airlines. No one should be under any illusion that you're flying out of CDG or another mega airport in a capital city. Could the departure hall use a lick of paint? Probably. Could a few more benches be put in? Absolutely. But as a functioning airport with many flights departing at similar times, it manages the best it can. We arrived at the airport early due to all of the fear-mongering in reviews, but it allowed us to see that the airport tries its best to manage the flow of traffic. There are screens over security confirming when you'll be able to go through passport control in relation to your flight time (approx. 2.5 hours for us, in line with the bag drop opening), and from there through to the end of security, it was barely even 5 minutes until we were in duty free. As I removed my liquids and electricals in advance (as nearly all airports expect and clearly have signposted, as is the same in BVA), there were no issues with security. Duty free is admittedly sparse, but there were signs up confirming that maintenance work was ongoing. The toilets were adequate, and there was a café open for use, as well as vending and hot drinks machines. There were plug sockets (FYI - not usb ports) and, in the grand scheme of things, a fair number of benches - there are 5 departure gates, and 2 of those are in a separate area, so the space is distributed fairly. In fact, the only issues that I could see occurring were from fellow passengers themselves! People with luggage double the size of the restrictions were being asked to pay the fee at the gate, but this should not be a surprise for anyone who spends even 30 seconds looking at their boarding card information. Likewise, an outgoing flight was held, but this was due to passengers being late to the gate (the call was done in English, French and the language of the flight destination, so there really were no excuses). If people try to blame the airport for this, then they should be taking a longer look at themselves. I'm ultimately reviewing BVA for what it is; a budget friendly space to travel for those of us who don't want to break the bank.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Buenos Aires,airport,S Galerte,3/13/2023,"I flew into EZE and out of EZE a week later, international flights for both. The arrivals process took about an hour and the lines moved slowly, but the staff was proactive in getting us through the process as quickly as possible, including by waving us over to the Argentine Citizen lanes once all the citizens were processed. Departure, however, was a considerably worse experience. The signs on the road into the airport clearly state that all international departures check in at Terminal A, so that's where my taxi driver took me. However, it turns out that Delta and Aerolineas Argentinas international departures check in at Terminal C, so I had to make the 5 minute walk over there in the hot sun (it was in the 90s Fahrenheit that day). After arriving at Terminal C I changed into long sleeved clothing because I was flying somewhere much colder; however, the Air Conditioning in the buildings was poor, so I sweated through my clothing very quickly just while waiting to check my bag. Finally, it seems that EZE has a rule that nobody can bring liquids over 100 mL onto a plane going to the United States. This rule seems was enforced on all flights to the US. But I have not seen that rule enforced on flights to the US from Europe or Asia, so it seems like it's airport (or at least Argentina) specific. It was incredibly annoying because it meant that I couldn't take any water with me on the plane. Unfortunately, if you're visiting Buenos Aires from very far away you'll likely have no choice but to use EZE. But be prepared for confusing directions, poor climate control, and stricter security protocols then you'll see elsewhere.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bengkulu,airport,3 reviewsRafael Suarez,6/27/2018,"I traveled to Bengkulu, Indonesia to visit friends for the first time in November 2017. Flew on Lion Air. Upon arriving at the airport we deplane using stairs and walked on the tarmac to the arrival building. It was late afternoon with the sun just about to set. The airport building is very quaint. Nice outdoor gardens greet you and on the day I arrived a nice afternoon breeze. Slowly make the way to the inside of the terminal where one luggage belt, half inside the terminal and a portion outside the terminal awaits. The luggage eventually arrives and it gives you time to see the pictures of some of the sights to see in Bengkulu. Once luggage in hand you go outside where there are various options for transport to where ever you are going. I was met by friends that took me to the hotel. Two weeks later, I left Bengkulu and experienced the departure area. You go through the usual security immediately upon entering the terminal, (say your good byes outside the door,) then walk to the check in desk where you obtain your boarding pass and check your luggage. English is not widely spoken at the airport if at all, but I had no issues whatsoever. You then go to the gate area, nice seats, air conditioned, tv's, bathrooms, and probably restaurants though I left on the first flight out and I not see anything to buy food or drinks. Eventually they called the flight, once again no English, and we boarded the same way, nice walk outside to the waiting aircraft. All in all a really nice experience in this airport.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Now I have five minutes to go through the body x ray and run to the gate!! Then after we went through the x ray machine the tsa officer made me go through again!! Without any reason at all!

The terminal a proper little toy-town terminal complete with tiny terminal control tower big burly firemen and one check-in desk. No compromise though on safety checks and procedures. Be sure to be here in good time to watch the incoming Twin Otter fly in and land on the beach. The tiny cafe sells lovely home made organic snacks and the whole experiences is a joy if you have only been used to the hustle and bustle and chaos of some large well known international terminals.

They will show you 20 Euros in coins and ask for a note in exchange. They are expert at a sleight of hand confidence trick. You will not get the correct change once they count it out for you. 2) There is a cafe on the first floor of international departures that is open 24x7 and is the only non-airside seating area. Particularly useful if your flight is delayed and are awaiting check in to open. 3) The Duty Free was open until 0100 am for the Air France Paris flight 4) I flew Kenyan Airlines to Nairobi, this was a flight originating in Mozambique or Reunion but assigned seat was not available as the transiting passengers were already stretched out over all seats.

At least the screening machines are sophisticated (laptops can stay in cases) and security personnel are mostly good-humoured.

For that you can enjoy a 3 course meal at 5 star Ascots for two. Or, you can feast on a huge Sunday Brunch at Fourways for $120 for two. I've included photos of the restaurant poster, and then of the Real restaurant. Only 4 items actually offered- none from their poster. There is one shop, which closes at 4pm. There are very few travel supplies typical of any other airport. They claim that the shop is duty free, but liquor prices are higher than in town. Do not expect any common airport facilities other than this. If more than 1 plane arrives or departs at the same time, expect a backup at every stage of your experience. Honestly, I've had better accommodation and service at regional airports handling local traffic and single engine planes.

Both times going there ranged from fair to poor; bathrooms need serious cleaning and the interior needs an update & it looks like some areas haven't been swept or vacuumed in ages. The gap between great experiences and worst experiences at Logan Airport is one of the worst I've ever dealt with in my life. I feel like I have been going to Logan at the best times and the worst times and it is the sharpest gap between good and bad that I've ever witnessed. The airport in Indianapolis on the other hand is way better; way cleaner, way more organized, way more selections to choose from, etc. Logan Airport itself is not a bad airport, but overall there is better airports out there. Logan is in need of improvement though I wouldn't recommend it because there is such a sharp gap between the good and bad here; you may get the really good or the extremely bad. Better options out there. Sadly this is my only choice to travel. But to others: beware. You never know what you will get. Logan is the most unpredictable airport you'll ever witness. Think twice.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Bermuda,airport,Raymond Breland,4/20/2005,"Like Bermuda itself this airport is a thoroughly civilized experience - not very busy so not crowded with a rather predictable traffic pattern of arrivals and departures. Facilities are very adequate and the duty-free shop has a reasonable variety albeit a bit expensive. On entry customs officials are polite and welcoming. When checking in for our departing flight the official who had to ""pat me down"" for a follow-up security check (the machine beeped when I went through) apologized for having to do so and thanked me for accommodating the security process! All in all a refreshingly unique experience - one that is alas vanishing amid the all-too-common post 9/11 over-zealous and ironically ineffective security measures elsewhere - Bravo to Bermuda and its airport!!",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Baltimore Washington,airport,C Horten,8/30/2024,"This is the second time I write about this airport. Last time it was about TSA and this time this passenger passed through quickly without any delay to to my disability. However when the plane touched down after a day of travel this passenger decided to wait at the aiport overnight. Well, after overnighting at the SFO, I thought this would be just an ordinary thing. However my night at Baltimore Washington Airport was so miserable that I must record several warnings. 1) All the eateries and cafes are closed by 11pm 2) The workers are about as friendly and responsible as formerly at greyhound 3) hourly wage mentality prevalent, so whatever is not spelled out in the handbook is okay, including for instance having ground crew workers on break purposely sitting by visitor repeatedly. 4) actually the supervision is so loose that the people going in and out of gate doors to the tarmac/cargo holding area can be wearing any ID. The guy that was eying me at Terminal C had an ID badge but he was taking a lot more breaks than a job allows. 5) all the workers seem to take a lot of breaks and sit around throughout the terminals talking, even socializing like at Terminal A. 6) At terminal C, while I was quietly sitting and napping the red-alarm bell on the ceiling at the gate went off ""by itself' several times. It also did that at the gate across where I was sitting. The alarm went on-and-off ""by itself"" four times at least, and each time, when I was sort of dozing off. I had commented to myself that the music was objectionable, and they ""changed the music to soft jazz."" So evidently the security was looking and listening to me throughout my stay, since obviously very few passengers stay here during the early morning hours. 6) When I walked to Terminal A (where I hoped there would be no alarms) the security speaker announced my last name and terminal location and that security was ""on it."" So apparently even though I am an older disabled person with no record or history of vagrancy or crime, the airport security were ""alert to my whereabouts"" to the point of announcing my last name and location so all the workers could hear. 7) At Terminal A, another ground crew again tried again to sit nearby during his ""break."" When I sort of had enough of this and was muttering to myself, that evidently was shared with some cleaning staff, and two burly janitors (twins) who were heading to clean one of the men bathrooms in Terminal A loudly and repeatedly jeered at me. ""Why does she have to keep moving around that ch*nk as if they was after her?"" that kind of thing. 8) At Terminal B it was quieter because by 4am I found of group of nonwhites who were sitting in a section. However again, another ID-badge worker tried to sit near by while I was napping. 9) Workers were also resting or napping in the food-hall area. As a consequence even though the food-halls and other shops look very attractive, I will not have any desire to eat here. 10) The nice thing about this was that while there were no formal guards questioning anyone, there are apparently enough ""night crew"" who keep going in and out of gate-doors (plus the other hidden cameras and mics) that they don't need them. The strange thing is it was hard to tell who was actually a hired worker and a part-timer with a badge who just sits around and tries to harass visitors. This is obviously why unlike at the SFO or LAX nobody wants to overnight here, period.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Brasilia,airport,Rob Brook,8/21/2012,Arrival from Lisbon - long queues for non-Brazilian passport holders at Immigration and then again at Customs after baggage pick-up. Only one person checking everyone from an A340 plane (it took over an hour) so decided not to line up but sit down and wait it out. At least there is a small shop to relieve the tedium. Bring a good book. Plenty of taxis outside to take you into the city. Mine was metered so the fare was as expected. Departure on an internal flight to Sao Paulo. Check in was rapid and lines at security not too bad. But eat outside in the pleasant concourse before you go through security. There is only one small snack stand (that we could find) on airside and the seating area waiting for the transfer bus is small and crowded. No wi-fi either. Essentially many parts of the airport seem not to have expanded with increased traffic. How this airport will cope with the crowds attending World Cup 2014 can only be imagined.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Belgrade,airport,J Jankic,10/16/2024,"Changes at the airport are for the worse. While the old Terminal 1 was a true architectural gem, its upgrade in the early 1980s brought the modern Terminal 2. However, the ongoing extension, which has dragged on for years, is nothing more than a dull corridor made from prefabricated materials. With this latest expansion, the airport has shifted from being one of the most passenger-friendly for regional transfers to one of the least accommodating. The attitude of the staff has also deteriorated, from being exceptionally relaxed and friendly to becoming cold, and, in my most recent experience (e.g., at the transfer desk), even arrogant and rude. This is something we were not accustomed to in Belgrade. One area in need of improvement is cleanliness. Belgrade is now one of the dirtiest airports —stepping into the terminal from a bus transfer feels like stepping into a trash can. The state of the toilets only adds to this poor impression.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

During a recent trip we touched down early only for no one to available to taxi us to an arrival gate which took 20mins, then a huge queue from the tarmac to get through passport checks, 30 mins, then a 45 min wait for bags.

The airport is built on the edge of the desert and is surrounded by picturesque desert panorama. Being tourist orientated all sorts of tourist services were available immediately upon retrieval of baggage.

I had booked with AZAL, but because it was a codeshare with Turkish Airlines, this made them less helpful!

Abbotsford Intl,airport,L Meade,1/3/2024,"Terrible staff, terrible experience.  It first started at the restrooms when one cleaning lady closed off both the men's and women's. Although she was clearly still cleaning the men's, a casual inquiry as to if I could use the women's restroom in the meantime was dismissed in a very rude and condescending manner. Even just the decency of politely pointing me to a different restroom would have been much more appreciated. Next, there was no one at the Flair counter managing bags or check ins. Some of us approached another staff if they could contact or follow up on the counter personnel. Again, rudely dismissed instead of kindly explaining any situation. After that, I began to manage some of my personal belongings at a seating area. A cleaning lady in her phone started sweeping at my feet and completely ignoring me while wiping the floor literally where I was standing and managing my stuff. She clearly could have waited until I was done before doing that right where I was standing or at the very least say ""excuse me"". Finally, at the checkout security there were two lines and as I approached, I even asked if I could line up there. She said yes, and after putting down my belongings in bins, she asked me to move to the next security line because they were down a personnel. Individually, maybe these incidents may be small, but the collective experience together with how the staff addressed situations were generally rude and dismissive.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,39 reviewsW James,10/12/2019,"Hollywood Burbank Airport is a perfectly splendid airport, and a not-so-perfectly-spendid airport, simultaneously. What do I mean? Well, first, Long Beach is my favorite airport in the Los Angeles area, with Burbank a respectable second, I find them to be more pleasant than (especially) LAX and even Orange County. The feeling of flying into and out of Burbank is one of aviation yesteryear of sorts, think sort of like the show, ""Wings."" Driving onto the airport and following the signage to the terminal and car rental return is simple and straightforward. Drop-off and pick-up areas in the front of the terminal are simply and clearly delineated, though sometimes difficult to access given the constant flow of traffic in that area (which is still nowhere remotely as bad as LAX, but, remember, Burbank's terminal is old). Walking into the airport, you clearly have a feeling of 1930s-era, Art Deco architecture, something really ""Americana"" and unique even as American airports go. Check-in for either American or Southwest is a breeze, no sarcasm, no ""lip service,"" all business, but still pleasant! Seating and flooring pre and post-security is a little aged and worn in some areas and could really stand to be improved, but they're also no worse than much of LAX. Shopping and dining options are very limited even by small airport standards, surprising, considering that we are still in the greater Los Angeles area after all. The staff at the car rental facilities are generally helpful and professional, though actually friendliness is hit-and-miss, I've never met anybody rude there, though. TSA personnel seem to be the most truly hit-and-miss, either ""sugar-coatedly"" friendly and jovial, or aloof and grumpy almost to the point of being rude. To TSA's credit here, though, they are amazingly efficient even by small airport standards, whether you have TSA Pre-Check or not. There has been a proposal by the airport authority to effectively construct a new terminal in the place of the existing terminal, which would be a shame to have materialize with the charming existing terminal could just be renovated and modernized while keeping its rich history in tact. In all, Burbank is a good airport with some notable warts, but positive experiences to be had, hard to rave about, but still easy to like.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

Almeria,airport,Stuart Ward,10/24/2010,Arrival okay queue to go through passport was a bit long. Luggage arrived on the belt as we got though. Limited baggage handlers so for a full charter flight might be longer. About 25 mins from landing to getting in the taxi. Going out the departure hall has been rebuilt much better and quicker. Security still tight big queue to get through. The departure lounge has been rebuilt and access to the rooftop terrace removed. The lounge is much better than the original. As work is going on don't know if there are plans to restore access to the roof. Small snack bar with coffee and rolls at reasonable prices but duty free for local stuff is the same price as supermarkets and imported stuff is more expensive than UK supermarket prices. Wouldn't want to arrive or depart when there are more than 2 charter/scheduled UK flights though. Then it would get overloaded very quickly.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Algiers,airport,9 reviewsAndre Bouzid,10/28/2015,"Arrival from London was fine but the immigration hall was packed and it took a bit of time to get through. Baggage claim is always a nightmare at Houari Boumidienne airport (Algiers) because everyone has so many huge bags and the system isn't very efficient. Connections to the city are ok but we got a taxi. On the way back, check in had a very long line. But since we had online check-in, they allowed to go into Club Europe's queue though the way the agents work so lethargically, it wasn't much quicker. Immigration was smoother than on arrival. Security was separated by gender which annoyed some less conservative Algerians. I have to say we got the timing spot on as we were able to buy some Algerian wine and after a few minutes, we were boarding. But then, there is more security after the boarding gate which slows everything down as the X-ray kept breaking. What I personally don't like about Algiers airport is that there is so much ""security"" when in fact, the officers behind the screen are just chatting and laughing, barely looking at the screen. Overall, it is an ordinary airport with nothing particularly good but not bad either.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

So if a US, Korean or New Zealand citizen arrives at the airport 45 minutes after I do, they will still be passing security check before I do, what kind of discrimination is this? At least we should have our own security queue. The suffering didn’t end there, we had to queue for 30 minutes in security control queue, and because I travel a lot for work, I knew the procedure, i took out my laptop from the bag, but, surprisingly, my tray was sent for manual checking, by the way, almost 50% of the bags went to manual check, that is another 15 minutes queue wait, and when it was my turn the inspector didn’t even touch the bag like what she did with the others, where she frisked all of them, she told me that I’m good and nothing is wrong here - why did you make me wait 15 minutes then?

Chaotic, going from one long snake line into the next, being ""herded"" into an elevator only to be driven into the next line. I truly felt like cattle. I wonder how those taxfree shops make any money, because you sure have no time or energy left to shop (or get a bite to eat). And when you finally arrive at the gate and actually glad that the plane was delayed (otherwise it would have been a close call), you have to sit on the floor to rest your feet from being on your feet for hours on end.

It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal.

Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Joaquim Coelho,12/18/2014,"I flew a couple of times this year into Belo Horizonte's Confins International airport and I must say that this airport lacks the basics. It was supposed to be renovated for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a few weeks before the tournament the airport was in utter chaos. It seemed as if I was in a construction sight. I came back during the World Cup and things improved a little giving it a more pleasant atmosphere. I am Brazilian so the language is not a problem but I spoke with some people that passed through the airport and they complained how few people spoke English. The airport does not receive many international flights. Only flights are to Buenos Aires-Argentina Miami-USA Lisboa-Portugal and Panama City-Panama and only a few of those are daily. Most of the times I arrived to this airport were on domestic flights but in July I came from the USA using a Copa Airlines flight from Panama City. I was puzzled as to why the plane did not parked directly at the gate since it arrived early in the morning and there were many finger gates with no planes parked whatsoever. Immigration officials were not friendly and showed little professionalism the lady that checked my passport had one earphone on and was chewing gum with her mouth open. The luggage carrousel is a complete mess as the area is very cramped and small. Customs was the only positive as once I had my luggage I went through it quickly. This airport has very bad air conditioning and in the summer it can be horribly hot inside and having to wait to board with very little seating can be a hassle. It is really far from downtown Belo Horizonte but the roads are good and I recommend taking the ""Conexão Aeroporto"" buses that take you straight to the center of the city for a rate of R$ 21 (around 10 dollars). This option is very advantageous because taking a cab directly from the airport is ridiculously expensive. Have seen worse airports but this one is one that I am certainly not very fond of.

This airport had a passenger record a few years ago, with 3 million passengers annually, therefore, they chose to expand the airport. But instead of giving passengers the more space they deserve, they chose instead to expand their very fine lounge, which is never filled, as well as the office for the staff - a disgrace to people who travel a lot. The design of the airport is great even though it is old. as mentioned, the staff are some of the friendliest staff and they are the reason why I love coming here. On a busy day of travel, it is impossible to find a place outside the lounge to sit down.",NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Alexandria Intl,airport,R Davidson,5/24/2019,"New and pleasant airport terminal. Quite spacious. Free Wi-Fi. Security was reasonably efficient and courteous. Limited food and beverage service.

Bangkok Don Muang,airport,Stephen Thomas,9/26/2022,"Haven't flown from here for 3 years due to covid, it's always been decent and I've found it relatively smooth but the website is way out of date, very disappointing for an international airport. Customer service desk was also very unhelpful, they no longer have 24 hour left luggage and no longer have bag wrapping, this left me stuck having to pay for excess luggage I didn't want to carry around Indonesia with me and of course meant extra expense. Ok both legs of my journey, check in was OK as was passport control but my flight was one of the last out at night so was relatively quiet anyway, only restaurant was McDonalds which I don't eat, a couple of coffee stalls with few sandwiches etc.. I don't understand why when you still have flights going everything pretty much shuts except for duty free!",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Beijing Daxing,airport,6 reviewsSun Xiaoou,2/5/2021,"The traffic of Beijing Daxing airport is very convenient. You can get there by high-speed rail. The design of Daxing airport is very grand and novel. There are many self-service check-in machines in Daxing airport. There are many open windows at the manual check-in place, and the queuing time is short. The efficiency of security inspection is high, but there are few open channels, which leads to a long queue time. After passing the security check, there are many restaurants in it, and the price is the same as that in the urban area. The departure and arrival of Daxing airport are mixed. There are many turntables at the baggage claim area, and the waiting time is very short. It's just that the airport guidelines need to be improved. I was a little confused when I went to Daxing airport for the first time. Airport WiFi is fast and supports takeout at the gate.",NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Almaty,airport,Nick Upton,6/8/2024,An absolute shambles of a place. Far too small for its purpose and extremely disorganised. Signage from domestic arrivals to international departures are not clear and security staff do nothing to stop people pushing and shoving and jumping the queue as you scan your luggage. The tiny check in area is shared with passport control so the lines intermingle with not enough staff. The waiting area is dark too small with nowhere near enough seating so that the whole place is crowded with people standing. Announcements are not clear and insufficient toilets for the crowds that build up. One of the worst airport experiences I've ever had. This is my second visit to Kazakhstan and I'm unlikely to return due to the surly staff and unorganized airport.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Mokhalad Alrubaye,7/11/2024,"I had a very bad experience starting with Berlin Airport.

Billund,airport,Christian Britten,9/17/2009,Billund is an excellent airport with good facilities practical layout and friendly and efficient staff. My only gripe is the airport bus which is extortionate (DKK180 to Aarhus) and runs at often perplexing times that seem to have no correlation to when major flights are landing. I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away. As the airport is far from where most foreign travellers want to be (unless they really like Lego) you often have little option but to wait for the bus or pay even more for a taxi.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Cagliari,airport,Luca Carboni,9/23/2006,This is my home airport. Completely renewed a few years ago it's now a very good and modern airport. Near the city center (just 5 minutes by car). It's a small airport but it's probably the better choice to come to Sardinia. Depending on winds you can have a fantastic view over the famous sardinian beaches from your airplane window. In the summer sometimes you may find crowds at security checks. There are just a few overpriced shops but this is common in italian airports. Car rentals taxis and bus are easy available.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Aberdeen,airport,C Hurley,5/27/2022,"The security staff at Aberdeen airport are not up to standard.

Burlington,airport,J Butler,7/20/2013,It is the only airport regionally that people have to use.

Bags arrived in a couple more minutes and we were out and looking for the car rental desk. On return, there were no queues and at security we did not have to take anything out of our bags. Our flex-economy ticket gave us access to the Aspire lounge which was very quiet but well stocked with food and beverages. Probably the longest walk from lounge to gate in the airport took about four minutes. Having picked up our rental car we were only a short ride into the heart of the city. Would use this airport again.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Akron–Canton,airport,2 reviewsJoseph Leonetti,1/1/2022,"Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Baku,airport,45 reviewsDiogo Freitas,1/27/2024,I paid 7 times more the normal rate to go from this airport to the city center. There are no ATMs on arrivals nor SIM cards shops. Your option is to accept the rides from the men who pest the arrivals area. They even have electronic terminals inside their taxis for you to pay by card their immensely overpriced rides. They are very well organized. Be very careful and smarter than me. Arrive with money of the country and call a Bolt or Uber by connecting to the airport WiFi.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bristol,airport,Geoff Bell,11/9/2023,"No reason to complain. Went to Dublin on the 6th November for the day. I arrived about 3 hours before departure because I had read about roadworks and tree felling on roads by the airport. Also heard about massive queues for early day flights. After arriving on the A3 bus from Weston Super Mare at about 4.45, I was through security and into the departure lounge by 5.05 am. It was seamless and I could have had another hour in bed. Arrival was good also. Was out of the airport terminal within a few minutes. Didn’t have baggage to collect. Found everything had improved since my previous flight through Bristol before Covid pandemic. Fortunately it wasn’t raining. The walk from the airport bus station up the hill to the terminal could have been unpleasant if I had a suitcase or if the weather was bad. I don’t understand why they can’t arrange for the buses to stop immediately by the terminal entrances to avoid that traipse.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Austin,airport,T Hayne,10/24/2024,"I am well traveled, and I used to live in Austin. This airport was the worst airport experience I have ever had. Ever. There were so many people crammed into such a small space. I cannot believe that it wasn't some sort of hazard. If there had been an emergency, people would've been trampled to death. I was at my gate very early, two hours before my flight. Normally, this is a nice calming time for me after a vacation and before I have to head home. There were no seats or floor space to be had within three gates on either side of my gate. The crowds were too much for me to want to walk even further than that. I finally found space three gates down behind the garbage cans on the floor. The crowd never stopped for two hours. Planes would take off, but even more people would come. I didn't want to get up and go to the bathroom because I was afraid that I would lose my trashcan floor space. Then there is the live music. I love live music, I love that Austin Airport has live music. But couple that with an insane amount of people and a PA system that never stops speaking. It is recipe for someone to crack. I don't think I could ever explain enough how crazy the idea that they are operating this airport like this is.. Now let's get to the PA system, I don't know why people in the gates need to know that some dude has illegally parked his car out front. In theory, that guy shouldn't have gotten past security. I don't think I've ever been in the airport that announced that in the gates area. It never stopped. There was always some car out. front illegally parked. Then you had the airlines trying to announce departures and find passengers. It was complete insanity. Who runs an airport like this? Now onto the bottled water fillers, I tried two different ones, both were trickling so slow that I gave up and bought water. Change your clogged filters Austin. I don't think I'll ever fly into/out of this airport again. I definitely would not suggest anyone with sensory issues to come within 100 miles of this airport. My goodness Austin, what a huge disappointment",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bergen,airport,Peter Thackray,12/13/2016,"A relatively small but busy airport serving a key city on the coast of Norway. Most flights are domestic within Norway. Domestic Arrivals mix with departures and there are 2 baggage belts on the ground floor behind the check-in desks, no specific separation between general public and flying public. On the ground floor there are 2 convenience shops selling snacks, drinks etc and a small café/bar. The Check-in is predominantly self-service with very few staff evident. Upstairs to Security and Departures. The main domestic departures has a few food outlets, a book shop and a convenience shop, there is a further section for International Travellers with full Duty Free options. Most planes land at a gate with pier so little need to be outside. No announcements or ""Last Calls"" are made so you need to look at one of the many monitors to check your flight status.

Berlin Schonefeld,airport,A Peale,9/16/2020,"Airport looks like an apocalyptic nightmare, completely empty, barely any seating. This could be tolarable if the security after passport control didn't have an attitude problem. I've flown in twice now and both times have been treated awfully for no reason. The most recent experience with them left me in tears. I get to security and the man checking through my liquids etc at the entrance spoke in English and was friendly enough. Then I had to go through the standing scanner machine and a woman held up her hand as if to tell me to wait and said something in German, so I just stood there until she signalled for me to come forward. Then she started talking to me again but didn't signal or move her hand to come forward or anything, so I went ''I'm sorry, I don't understand'' and she abruptly said (in English), ''where are you from'', I told her the UK, then she went, ''you are in Germany, so you ask me, speak English please.'' I just looked at her confused and replied ''Should I come through or?'' then again in English repeated 'You are in Germany, so you ask me please if you want me to speak in english''. I replied, ''okay''. She looked at me in disgust then she waved me through, I did the scanner then she started really roughly giving me a pat down, pulling my top out because it was tucked into my jeans, pulling at my waist, I was just standing there like, wow, what is happening. She finished and just turned away so I just walked to the belt, collected my bag and coat then got out there ASAP.

Bergen,airport,C Huang,8/4/2019,"Terrible service, security staff totally not efficient. I bought some stuff and had to do some tax refund, the tax forms said that I had to show the purchased items when requesting the refund. The problem was that the refund point was after security control so I could not go in with my luggage. I asked the security how to deal with that and they said send the lugagge and go in with your stuff. So I did that, but I was stopped because I was carrying a tube with cod roe which I had to throw even though I discussed with security that I did what I was told by his colleague. Had to give up the stuff I purchased legally because the staff did not tell me how to proceed correctly. First of all, tax refund point should be before security check, second thing is that the tax refund forms say that I had to show the items, but the security guys did not tell me that, because of their ineficiency I had to throw my purchase for nothing. I even asked for complaint forms and they did not give me that, that's why I am writting this review, to express my totally disappointment against a totally unacceptable way of doing things, i understand is their duty to comply with security protocol, but don't tell me to bring the stuff inside if you are not 100% sure that it will go in.

Car parking was ok for a change, the anpr camera actually worked this time and issued me with a ticket then opened up. Check in was simple enough but as before there is a distinct lack of seating in departures. The vast bulk of seating is swallowed up by overpriced eateries. I didn't see any mobile charging ports etc although I believe there are some in the private lounge that will cost you around £30 to enter.

The options for food and drink are also poor - after security the only options are a small bar for beer and a snack kiosk. The WiFi service is fine, but only if you’re in the tiny part of the airport where it seems to work - most of the time you’ll find the WiFi network nonexistent, which made the idea of doing any work a nonstarter. Particularly bad is the area past the immigration kiosks. The only amenities there are vending machines which charge nearly €5 for a bottle of coke, with nowhere to fill up water bottles or even to get a bad coffee.

Notable things about Austin-Bergstrom International (AUS): - there are two terminals the (main) Barbara Jordan terminal where all the restaurants, lounges and stores are, and the South Terminal currently Allegiant and Frontier Airlines. - there is a family viewing area outside the airport for watching planes and having a picnic. There are currently 4 lounges (AA, UA, DL and a Chase Sapphire Terrace) - there are many good places to eat including many local restaurants (my favorite are Taco Deli, Salt Lick BBQ, Second Bar + Kitchen, Annie's, and Juiceland. - it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end of the terminal to the other, along the way you will see lots of places to eat, drink and shop.

Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Geoff Painter,9/30/2024,"After over 50 years of air travel, and twenty transatlantic return flights, I experienced the worst check in and airport experience at Berlin Brandenburg in September 2024. My wife and I completed the online check in but that proved to be of little help as it provided us with no means of obtaining the necessary Baggage tags for us to use the bag drop procedure. With minimal staff available, and a long line of people requiring help in fully checking in, we lined up for over an hour before we were able to check our bags. We then lined up for 45 minutes I'm order to go through security. The treatment we received going through security was appalling. My wife and I are not fluent German speakers and when we did not immediately fully understand the instructions, they were simply repeated louder and in a very exasperated tone. We were then thoroughly frisked iand required to take up pistures difficult for those in their seventies. It felt as though we were being punished and the hostility was palpable. Throughout Berlin Brandenburg the lack of Lufthansa staff to respond to inquiries was a problem and we were unable to get necessary information about our connecting Lufthansa flight. The signage in the airport is very poor especially for those arriving at the Flughafen Berlin railway station and there were no staff around to help people.

Barcelona,airport,J Woolley,1/5/2025,"The staff really let this airport down. And everything everyone else said negatively below (heat of airport, difficult layout, unhelpful security/info) unfortunately remains true as of Jan 2025. Airport amenities wise average, but the staff, especially passport control seem to actually enjoying belittling, ignoring & dismissing people. It’s horrible to experience that level of nastiness. As others have said the passport queues are ridiculously long & it’s a long walk across the airport. It takes time to get to the gate with elderly/infirm people or young children. We set off for our gate the second it popped up - when we got to passport control the queue was huge. Many people in the queue were worried about missing their flight, us included. When we explained, extremely politely, to the queue staff our concerns she shrugged, said she didn’t care & coldly told us we had to queue at the back. Nice! When we finally got to the man (policia nationale) stamping our passports, he asked if we were going to London. When we said yes, (knowing we were now cutting it fine for our flight) he stamped one then literally put the others to one side while he spent a few minutes answering a what’s app message totally ignoring us (the picture which had popped up on his phone made it clear it was a personal text). We politely waited & bit our tongues knowing he was enjoying his little moment of power until he finally slowly stamped the other passports & literally threw them back at us. Our kids were bewildered as to why the man ‘didn’t like us’! Whole experience stressful & made us feel completely unwelcome. Such a shame - we really loved Barcelona but the stress of almost missing our flight & being treated so nastily means we will visit Seville or Madrid (or another country entirely) next time which we found a much more pleasant experience overall.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Bishkek,airport,Kieran Shotter,6/29/2019,"Small airport which seemed a bit chaotic. Flew with Turkish airlines their first flight was delayed so check in for mine was busy due to 5 counters checking in two full flights. Immigration was quick didn't ask to many questions. Security metal detector doesn't work they just pat down everybody coming through. After security, not much food places on one end can get busy in the departure area. Boarding was a mess no queuing system for two flights with desks close together so people kept getting into the wrong queue. Fine airport for a short time.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Abuja,airport,Antonio Tettamanzy,4/14/2011,It was better than expected but can be quite messy sometimes. Currently (April 2011) the road which connects the airport to town is under maintenance and traffic at peak hours is nothing less than crazy so program yourself to go there early. In the passengers lounge there is absolutely nothing to do but a couple of convenience stores to buy soda and crackers. Toilets are decent but with no towels nor soap to wash the hands.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Bacolod–Silay,airport,13 reviewsMichael Mejia,6/22/2017,"Bacolod is a small regional airport in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines, which is a short 50 minute flight from MNL. Arrival is short and painless and even if I didn't check any luggage for this particular flight, baggage was out in the conveyor even after my disembarkation through a rather short airbridge. Departure was also pretty fast and straightforward. The waiting area, however, was crowded, hot and dirty. Very few options outside of the very basic business class lounge to sit, eat or have a drink.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Billund,airport,M Cooper,2/19/2020,"Kind, friendly staff! I was due to travel back to Frankfurt on 9th February when Storm Ciara/Sabine hit Northern and Central Europe. My Lufthansa flight was cancelled before I left for the airport and I was rebooked via text message onto two SAS flights - Billund-Oslo then Oslo-Frankfurt the next day. Unfortunately, after 3/4 hour at the gate on the Monday, my SAS flight was cancelled for technical reasons. There was no SAS rep at the airport so we all had to call their call centre to rebook our flights. I was pretty frustrated but an SAS employee at the call centre was friendly enough when I got through and told me my flight had already been rebooked, though I hadn't had a text message or mail at that time. The Billund airport staff I spoke to couldn't have been friendlier and more helpful. Their hands were tied as they weren't responsible for rebooking our flights but they went out of their way to guide me and fellow passengers. I had had no info from the airline about the chance of booking a hotel/meal vouchers etc. but one kind airport employee took it into his own hands and sorted it all out for me, booking a room and printing a voucher (which they could clearly then redeem from SAS). In short, not much more than an hour after the flight cancellation announcement, I was in an airport hotel room and had time to have dinner and relax before flying the next morning (which all happily worked out). I often fly to and from Billund airport and it's one of my favourites - comfortable, good design, good shops, cafes and restaurants, plenty of seating, perfect view of the runway, etc. Since that day, I've added friendly staff to my list of positives.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Colleen Rotkis,3/6/2022,"Security lines are insane. This is my 3rd experience with it, and I’m starting to piece together the scam. Don’t we pay a surcharge on every ticket purchased for the delightful experience of trusting TSA to keep us safe by making us remove our shoes and other useless acts. They keep the security lines long creating stress and panic so you consider signing up for Clear ($179/year and more privacy invasion with a retina scan and fingerprint capture). So the elite (those willing to fork over the dollars on top of their federal and any other taxes that fund airports and plane ticket fees) cruise on through security while the other ~97% of passengers languish in line and miss their flights. How on earth the warlord of the Birmingham airport allows 70% of TSA staff to service the elites on the TSA Precheck/Clear side vs the 30% (~4 TSA employees) on the side of the regular people, only makes sense in a corrupt government deal. I thought that this would be aggravating for the airlines on the other side of the curtain wondering where the passengers were who paid a pretty penny to fly like cattle while being prodded to pull their masks over their nose the whole time. But a little research revealed that the airlines invest in companies like Clear. Silly me. It’s a circular racquet probably formulated along the lines of the Chicago red light camera and parking meter debacle. Bottom line: pay your toll at the troll bridge or suffer along with the peasants.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abidjan,airport,D Sane,12/13/2017,"I have been transiting a few times recently. The airport looks clean, nice and modern, but it's very disorganised. Boarding passes are checked more than five times, while once or twice should be enough. Security screening sees long queues up into the immigration area, due to excessive scrutiny. Transit passengers need to queue to have their boarding pass checked, a practice I haven't seen anywhere else in the world. This all adds to delays, affecting connecting flights as well. For boarding Air Côte d'Ivoire, passengers are asked to wait outside of the terminal, for a bus to the plane, several destinations combined. This kind of takes away the point of checking the boarding pass five times over before completing the boarding process within the terminal. WiFi is free for just half an hour. The terminal is modern and clean, but even at this small size it already looks very overstretched. Lomé Airport does a better job of being a hub in West Africa.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bergerac,airport,S Gaudicheau,6/6/2010,Arrival was great. I was at passport control within 2 minutes of landing. On the way back it was another story. I couldn't do the online check in and I found out at the airport that it's not provided when you fly from Bergerac. You have to queue with everybody in order to get your boarding pass even if you only have hand luggage. Ground personnel very slow until the call was made to invite people for boarding. They then suddenly were very quick. The toilets aren't provided with coat or handbag hangers which I find not practical.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,Jacob Thomas,3/21/2024,"The facilities are fine. The check in staff at the checkin time is ok. When you reach the boarding gate, they will make you stand in a queue for an unnecessary check to tick the boarding pass with their pen and then make you wait again. The staff at this check point has already interviewed you at the check in counter. They have a rude behaviour and tone and not friendly at all.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Borg El Arab,airport,M Abdou,9/4/2011,Clean and modern. Queues at immigration especially when you find no one helping however the immigration officer was polite and friendly.

Brussels Charleroi,airport,D Calenez,5/26/2024,"Do not know even how to put into words how bad this airport works.

Taxi collect if could be another option paying 15€. The infrastructures of the airport are poor, are not well maintained. The most impacting this is that we have to pat 1€ for the toilettes even when you get out of the plane and you re still in the passengers area just right before arrivals. Entrance to the toilette and exit has only one door lathe, so people have to wait, even if you re paying for the service. Ticket flixbus can only be paid by card.

Bologna Marconi,airport,K Carsen,8/21/2024,"This is the worst airport we have ever flown from. Our cruise ended in Ravenna and we had the choice of flying home from either Bologna or Venice. We chose Bologna because it was nearer. Big mistake!! Through no fault of our own, we arrived at the airport at 10am for a 5pm flight to London. We couldn't check in until 2pm, so we had to hang around, with our luggage for 4 hours. The check-in area was heaving and there was limited seating. The seats were metal and very uncomfortable! There were shops and food outlets so we could eat and drink. 2pm came and we were able to check-in. A large queue quickly formed behind us but the lady in charge refused to open the check-in until she had had the floor cleaned to remove a few scuff marks! We checked-in, eventually cleared the long security queue and found ourselves in Departures. If we thought the check-in floor was bad, Departures was an absolute nightmare! For an international airport, the area was very small and horribly overcrowded. Seating was even more limited than downstairs and people were sitting on the floor. We saw one woman sitting in a corner breastfeeding her baby! There were long queues for the toilets. There were a couple of food outlets but no seats, so it was a choice of stand up or sit on the floor! All in all, Bologna airport was a very unpleasant experience and we will never fly from there again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Highly recommend using this service if you have a family member with disabilities. We applied for the same program at Orlando and no one helped us, the staff were rude and the lady guarding the family and disabled line tried to turn us away.

Boston Logan,airport,LeRoy McDonald,8/29/2024,"I had the absolutely worst experience at Logan airport today (8-28-2024) First, we were in the security line when the scanners broke down. So, we had to leave the line and get into another line. Fine, this happens, so we move to the back of a different line. Then as we finally got to the point when it was our turn. Then an airport person comes with a wheelchair person and goes before us, no problem. Now it's our turn again, but then another airport person comes with someone else, not handicapped and the two of them just rudely walk right in front of us. No explanation. No ""sorry or ""excuse us"", nothing. Of course, at this point I am now tired of trying to get through this line, so I had said ""Excuse me"". The airport person started flipping her airport badge at me saying she can do anything with this badge. She was scary, and I was really taken aback by her attack. Instead of saying ""Sorry I needed to get this lady through security"", she started yelling that she could call security or the police on me. I was looking to the person that was in the process of taking our ID and she did not understand what was happening either. We were just grateful that this rude, person was walking away now. I probably should have called security on her right away but didn't. This incident really bothered me the rest of the day and I really regret that I did not get her name.

Disgusted, especially because I am from Slovakia. The only people with some good customer service were only at the duty free shops/bars. Regarding toilets, not the best conditions and no soap!

Everything went smoothly and we were through immigration baggage and customs in no time. Once landside I realised my cell phone had fallen out of my pocket probably on the plane. A member of the BMI ground staff called the plane who found the phone and brought it to me. If arriving at Bishkek always make sure you are being collected at the airport by someone you trust and don't rely on taxis at the airport. Check in on the return trip at about 5.30 am was trouble free if a little slow on account of no online check in for my Turkish Airlines flight and painfully sluggish check in and security check staff. Travelled Business Class. Don't expect much from the BC lounge. Tired sandwiches and cake very limited choice of beverages and staff who were more interested in keeping up their conversation with each other to be bothered with the customers.

Plenty of seating. Clean. Domestic departures. At security beware the overzealous and brusque female personnel with their metal detector wands. A small coin inadvertently left in a pocket will immediately incur their wrath. Perhaps their rigorous practical training could also include occasional use of the words 'please' and 'thank you'. Polite manners to avoid confrontations are as important when dealing with foreigners as they are with the locals. International departures: leave plenty of time for passport control and security which is efficient but there can be long queues.

Addis Ababa,airport,H Smart,9/29/2023,"What a shambles this airport was for our very recent transits. The bus transfer from the incoming flight took forever and by the time we got to security the approximately ten wide column of people had to go down to one to go though security. When we got to the security screening there were no boxes to put liquids, laptops etc. into, and when someone eventually appeared with a stack of them it was a free for all as there wasn't enough to go round. Having survived security we had four hours before our connection to Dar Es Salaam. There were nowhere near enough seats and no air conditioning despite how warm it was. When the gate information came up, (C6 I think it was), we went to our departure gate to find there were two flights going from the same gate before ours, so there were hundreds of people waiting at our gate along with hundreds of others waiting for several other gates all in the same row. The electronic departure board stopped working, no staff to ask for information and another slow bus transfer out to the plane. The return experience was not much better although slightly better organised at security screening. Still not enough seats and still very hot in the main areas. When we went to our gate we had to wait to be admitted to gates A14 - 16 as again there were two flights leaving that area before ours. Seats were very difficult to get and when we finally went through to A15 we had to go through another security screening with shoes and belts off, again. When boarding started it was a free for all until a man appeared and stopped anyone who wasn't in zone 2, but as no announcement was made no-one knew it was boarding by zone number. He disappeared and a lady then appeared and held up three fingers which we assumed, correctly I'm pleased to say, that zone three could board, but again, no announcement. The one good point was no bus transfer. We hope we never have to transit through Bole again.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,A Makki,8/27/2018,"The airport is much better now since the renovation is complete. Plenty of parking when you arrive. There are a range of shops (Patchi chocolate, Bookstore, Coffee bean tea leaf, bodyshop) in the pre-departure area and a restaurant. There are ATM machines, a baggage sealing service and currency exchange stand (but they never have Singapore dollars). Check in was a breeze, done in several minutes. Passport control is quick. Once you enter the departure lounge, to the right is a food court that sells food to order (manly Asian dishes). There is a convenience store, some stores that sell traditional Bruneian foods and watch / perfume stores. I was told more stores will be added soon. The waiting area has good lighting, there are priority seats near the gate for those with young children and elderly people. The toilets were clean. There is a prayer room for Muslim travellers. On arrival there is a short walk to customs and immigration. Separate counters for local, ASEAN, Diplomatic and foreigners. There are plenty of trolleys at the baggage carousel. There is a green and red channel, there are several officers always on duty. I left a hand luggage on the plane, luckily I was able to retrieve it. There is a door at the side of KFC which leads back to the arrivals hall. The bag was aleady in the office for me to collect. In the arrivals hall there is a KFC and Burger King, also Counters for DST and Progressif which are the mobile phone carriers. You can purchase tourist sim cards which have minutes and data pre loaded. There is a counter for tourist information and Hertz / Avis car rental. Upon exiting the terminal there is a taxi service, taxis are metered. You can also use the ride hailing app Dart. There is a local bus service, but it's not available for the late flights.

She never spoke one word, just raised her hand to silence me then slammed boarding passes on the counter. Next the girl before security ripped boarding passes from me, tore them in two and practically threw them back. Completely unnecessary. The woman who searched me indicated with gestures for me to raise my arms, turn around and then dismissed me with a flick of the hand. Last was the dour faced man checking passports.

Abidjan,airport,Anoma Yao,6/30/2014,Small airport but modern and clean facility. No hustlers in the terminal unlike in most African airports. Not much queuing at check-in immigration and security. Air-conditioning functions toilets are clean airbridges and no pax busses but poor amenities: no wifi tiny duty free zone and unattractive lounge.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,Joaquin Quinto,11/5/2008,Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns.

Buffalo,airport,3 reviewsD Bingham,10/4/2015,"Nice Airport. Well organised checkin for B6 and speedy transit through TSA, roomy concourse and nice Buffalo wings. There was a fire alarm while we were there which was dealt with with only minor disruption, good views of the apron and active runway. A good alternative to Toronto for Niagara.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,Helen Heron,9/17/2014,We have just returned from a trip to Tenerife with Jet2 and used Blackpool for the first time as the flight times from here were excellent. Yes it is only small but check in a security were swift with no problems encountered and adequate facilities for a drink and a little browse in the duty free. On our return again swift baggage claim and on the road home within half an hour. The only downside we arrived well before we were meant to and check in wasn't even open however the parking was a nightmare. We went right round the back to the overflow car park and only at the very last minute managed to squeeze on the end of someone else. I cant imagine what would have happened if wed left it later we would have missed our flight. Also it was a long walk to the terminal building and it was pouring with rain we were amazed their wasn't and easier way in to the building also our car on return was covered in dust from all the passing vehicles. This aside I would travel from here again as the good out weighs the bad but I really think you should assess the parking situation as this is very limited for the passengers travelling and is letting this airport down?,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Bohol-Panglao,airport,13 reviewsAndreas Becker,5/28/2022,Quiet new airport opened in 2018. Check in was efficient. Distance to Alona Beach only a few minutes.

Biratnagar,airport,8 reviewsAlok Mishra,6/22/2024,"An airport serving domestic routes in Nepal, capital Kathmandu to the capital of Koshi Pradesh and two other places in the eastern hilly regions. Very basic in services and facilities. IATA code BIR. For arrival a belt is there to collect luggage that is manually handled. Aircrafts that this airport gets is ATR, Beech, Twin otter and the likes. For departure a small hall is there which houses check in counters dedicated to domestic operators, few seating benches, toilets, security check points and one cafe. Not clean, looks dirty. Parking is available outside. Taxis are available for conveyance.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Astana,airport,8 reviewsMaarten Caspers,12/23/2016,"Astana is a small international airport, that is well connected to Europe via Frankfurt, London, Paris and Amsterdam through Kazakhstan's Air Astana. The airport has only one terminal for Domestic and International flights. A new terminal is being constructed next to the existing facility which is planned to be opening in spring 2017. The arrivals and baggage reclaim is small. Immigration quite smooth and officers were friendly, but remember to fill in your immigration card with a blue or black pen, not with a red one as it is not accepted. I had almost no queues. Taxi pick-up at the terminal is not well-organised and taxi recruiters can be annoying. The central hall for departures is quite spacious and there is sufficient seating around the check-in area. Check-in areas are small and somewhat old-fashioned, but work fine. Friendly ground staff. Short queuing time at check-in, passport control and security. Emigration passport control is fine. There are few F&B and retail facilities at the international departure gates. There is plenty of seating at the end of the concourse close to the small cafe in the back. Transferring between international flights is quick and easy. Passengers do not have to pass immigration, only security screening. It took me only 5-10 minutes from arrival gate to departure gate. F&B and retail facilities are limited, especially in the departure are after immigration. Food choice is limited. Very good wifi while waiting for check-in or for your flight. Password can be obtained via SMS. Terminal and toilets are clean. Remote arrivals and departures (via bus) in winter when temperatures can go below -20 Celsius can be cold and slippery, but also a very interesting experience. When the new terminal will be opened in 2017 I assume less aircraft will be handled via busses.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Bishkek,airport,J Joshua,5/1/2009,"Overall the airport does the job and is an adequate small international hub but travellers beware of a dangerous scam by unregistered taxi drivers here.

Two young men to one older man no contest here. Foolishly I only spotted the warning signs that the two of them were trouble too late and am grateful that it was only my pocket that was dented. Only ever take a registered taxi with the yellow taxi sign on top or better still have someone meet you.

Abuja,airport,Mark Bickerton,5/24/2009,The international terminal is nice and quite well organised but there is nothing much to do there.

Brno,airport,1 reviewsS Lewis,4/10/2017,"Very small airport, on the day I was there, only 2 flights were scheduled during that day (Saturday). There is a bar and small tax free shop where you can get the usual liquor and spirits. Just 1 or 2 toilets which are rather small, but again for the amount of people using it, I do not consider it a problem. Small area to play for kids, and you just walk about 200 meters to the airplane which will be parked directly in front of the departure hall. Very convenient, quick security check and baggage drop off and it's easily accessible with both car and public transport (bus), which will depart twice every hour and will take you about 30 minutes to downtown. Wi-Fi does not work all the time but when you restart it, it will be working again.",NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Bremen,airport,Jurgen Arnold,10/8/2007,As living in the north of The Netherlands Bremen airport is a good alternative for Amsterdam. Recently flown from the new low cost Ryanair terminal. Its basic clean and blue! There is a multipurpose shop which sells everything from a to z at somewhat inflated prices and small coffee shop. Seating is mostly in plastic chairs which you could find at your local dentist. Reasonable but we had an early flight so it was not so crowded. Would not like to be there when its get full. There are also some paid internet terminals. The airport is well situated from the city center and freeway from the parking garage you are within 3 minutes in the main terminal building. Bremen is still a great small airport but they need to get some other low cost airlines on board besides Ryanair.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE

Algiers,airport,Qaddoumi Samar,5/16/2013,Algiers airport is huge and clean but I did not enjoy the business class lounge it was extremely poor compared to other countries.

Bremen,airport,T Andrews,8/24/2017,"Bremen is a small and convenient airport, and my experience proved enjoyable. Arriving with Air France I disembarked in the main terminal. Very short walk to the baggage claim, I picked my suitcase within ten minutes. Tram line 6 frequently connects the airport with the city centre (every 6min during peak hours, 20min otherwise), travel time 10min. A one-way ticket costs €2.75, however beware that the machines accept neither credit cards nor bank notes greater than €10. Easy departure with no queue at baggage drop-in. I breezed through security, Bremen uses the full-body scanner which makes the screening process much faster. Security staff efficient and friendly. Bright departure lounge but there might not be enough seating facilities if all gates are used at the same time. Only issue: Not enough toilets facilities either landside (well hidden at the very end of the building!) or airside (one toilet block only).",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Ajaccio,airport,Nick Strohecker,5/29/2019,"Although the airport itself is fine, the security agents are rude, inconsistent, and not bright. Trekking poles were deemed weapons, thus not allowed on the flight, but only some. Other poles, of the exact same type, size, everything, were confiscated by guards that seemed to enjoy their limited power to taint one's vacation. If one needs to bring poles or anything similar through security, I recommend faking a limp or hope that the main jerks are on a lunch break.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Beauvais,airport,Raluca Dana Cozma,7/1/2024,"Worst airport I’ve ever been in. Worst and disrespectful staff I’ve ever met. First, after waiting in the line for the airport checkpoint, a very nice man is waiting for you. He doesn’t speak English because this airport doesn’t cover international flights and there is no need to speak English. Luckily me I speak some French to understand what he is mumbling between shouts. This man shouts at everybody because, why not, the airport is his belonging and he can act whatever he likes to. And if you don’t show him at once all the five tickets for the 5 people you are with, he will shout at you and let other people pass in front of you. After escaping the first test, you arrive at the checkpoint. Where the staff doesn’t know that if you are a diabetic and have a sensor, it’s allowed to get a bottle of water with you inside the airport. Of course, she has to put it in special tray and scan it, but she doesn’t want to do that because it’s to complicated. This is not the end and after you pass the second test, you arrive at the gate.  I don’t know who trains these people but the obviously they didn’t find out that Romania is now in Schengen Area and continue to verify each person’s ID. And after that you have to stand in line, outside the building, 30 minutes or more, no matter if it’s hot or freezing outside. And that’s it! I’ve never felt more humiliated in my entire life, I have to say that one more time. I hope I never see this airport and I don’t recommend it.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Albany,airport,Marc Schwartz,5/16/2005,"I used to live in Albany and have used this airport many times. Albany is a really nice regional airport. It is very close to the Interstate. The standard parking is extremely convenient (across an indoor footbridge; no shuttles). The airport is physically very appealing and flow through check-in to the gates is generally smooth. Same on the return (also note that rental car stuff seems to be a convenient arrangement as well). ALB is as close to ""get there at the last minute and be OK"" as any these days. B terminal is the nicest. Of course this is a regional airport without many of the amenities of a large one. The coffee shop and bar/restaurant are better than most though. I now live in LA and have a much greater hassle. Burbank airport seems similar in size to Albany but Albany is much much nicer.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

I panicked and thought there was no hope that I would find the goods. I called the airport just to try our luck. The airport staff told me to describe the items that we lost and would contact us after checking with the lost and found department. Only a few moments later, the airport called me that they found my items at the lost and found. A janitor had turned them in. We can arrange to collect the items anytime. It all seemed crazy to me because the items were in perfect condition. I was so grateful and could not believe that my stuff would be able to be found.

The instructions received are short and rude! The systems and procedures are non existing, numerous people checking and rechecked and scribbling on your ticket.

Amman Queen Alia,airport,J Natinski,1/1/2024,"It was by far the worst airport experience I've ever had. The airport security personnel were incredibly rude and treated passengers with utter disrespect. They thoroughly searched through all of my belongings, including my medically prescribed medications, without any consideration for privacy or common courtesy. What shocked me the most was the length of time the security check took. Despite there not being a large number of people in line, the process took well over an hour, causing me to almost miss my flight. The airport was unprofessional and dirty. The facilities were poorly maintained, and the overall atmosphere was one of chaos and disorganization. It's clear that the staff are in need of proper training in customer service and basic hygiene practices. I would strongly advise anyone considering traveling through Amman International Airport to find an alternative route. The treatment and conditions at this airport are unacceptable, and I would never subject myself to such mistreatment and unhygienic conditions again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Akron–Canton,airport,2 reviewsJoseph Leonetti,1/1/2022,"Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door.

Amman Queen Alia,airport,C Larson,9/16/2022,The airport looks very futuristic and modern from the outside but the inside is total chaos. It really isn't big enough for the number of passengers wanting to check in. This is made worse by all the Royal Jordanian flights being in one giant queue waiting for a check in desk. Why isn't is possible to check in using the RJ App? Why don't they dedicated queues for each flight? The result was total chaos with a member of staff running up and down calling out the flight destinations to get the passengers out of the queue because the flight was starting to board. Once you get past the check-in and security there is massive of space for shops and restaurants. It seems the airport is more interested in making money than having enough space and desk so passengers can check in easily,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bengkulu,airport,3 reviewsRafael Suarez,6/27/2018,"I traveled to Bengkulu, Indonesia to visit friends for the first time in November 2017. Flew on Lion Air. Upon arriving at the airport we deplane using stairs and walked on the tarmac to the arrival building. It was late afternoon with the sun just about to set. The airport building is very quaint. Nice outdoor gardens greet you and on the day I arrived a nice afternoon breeze. Slowly make the way to the inside of the terminal where one luggage belt, half inside the terminal and a portion outside the terminal awaits. The luggage eventually arrives and it gives you time to see the pictures of some of the sights to see in Bengkulu. Once luggage in hand you go outside where there are various options for transport to where ever you are going. I was met by friends that took me to the hotel. Two weeks later, I left Bengkulu and experienced the departure area. You go through the usual security immediately upon entering the terminal, (say your good byes outside the door,) then walk to the check in desk where you obtain your boarding pass and check your luggage. English is not widely spoken at the airport if at all, but I had no issues whatsoever. You then go to the gate area, nice seats, air conditioned, tv's, bathrooms, and probably restaurants though I left on the first flight out and I not see anything to buy food or drinks. Eventually they called the flight, once again no English, and we boarded the same way, nice walk outside to the waiting aircraft.

Amman Queen Alia,airport,T Hilderbrandt,11/21/2024,"Terribly disorganized airport. Signage is horrible for international transfers. Had to go through security 3 times. E.g., bought some overpriced water by the boarding gate. Then they ordered all passengers out to go through security and then they took my water away. At security, they pulled my bag apart, then just stuffed things in randomly. I had to repack the whole thing. Few staff speak any English and they are rude. Also the airport has zero places to lie down anywhere. Avoid this airport if you can. They are amateurs in this business and a disgrace.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Auckland,airport,P Hayward,2/3/2025,"The worst international airport in the world. We arrived back in NZ after three years away to this mess and national embarrassment. The confusion starts after Customs at the bottom of stairs before baggage claim where two people are yelling at you to go two different ways based on if you are declaring something. The baggage claim belts are so close to the bio security lanes that there is no room to get bags. We then thought we were doing the right thing by declaring items (what a mistake). Waited nearly an hour for someone to put a sticker on passport then went into another queue and waited the same only to be put in a different queue again and cleared (same as if we hadn’t declared!) Overall it took us over 2 hrs after landing to clear the international terminal and we missed the bag drop time to our domestic flight so had to run with 6 suitcases to the domestic terminal and just caught our connecting flight by 5 minutes. Extremely stressful, disappointing, and frustrating from a frequent traveler who has seen how great other airports around the world n make it work. Auckland is the only airport I’ve been in where there is no priority or benefit associated with being a New Zealander for processing, it’s actually faster if you are not. Will avoid this airport wherever possible in the future for family or business travel.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bratislava,airport,P Anderson,12/16/2018,I have witnessed a steady decline in this Airport. Although the building is fairly new and it is relatively clean the attitude of the staff is awful. So many of them are uninterested and dare I say it arrogant. I actually get the impression they have such a massive distain for the passengers its quite disturbing! So you have a nice terminal filled with people who obviously hate their jobs so much it seems to be like some kind of torture! The Airport needs to change its management because its clear there is no leadership. For goodness sake just get somebody who wants to work there and smiles!,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Ankara,airport,Badon Ghijben,11/3/2023,"What a poor airport. There is no route from domestic arrivals to international.

Abuja,airport,C Stafford,1/31/2010,Upon arrival from Amsterdam on KLM I went to use the bathroom and there was no garbage can and no toilet paper. The airport was cleaner than I expected. I think it's better than Lagos actually. Our luggage failed to arrive with us and we were told to come back in 3 days time to pick it up! We weren't going to be anywhere near Abuja in 3 days! We were told later by the airline (after we got back to the US) that they should have delivered it to us. (It was a 6 hour drive one way by the way.) Leaving was a nightmare. They had no record of our changed flight days and had no way of checking with our credit card (we were told that's all we would need to verify our changed dates-a credit card.) We were told to step aside while they helped other passengers. Then we were sent to one person who told us to go to another person etc etc. It took two hours to straighten out the mess and that was only because my husband had to beg the woman to let him use her computer so he could check his email which he was sure would have a confirmation of the change. I will say this particular woman was very professional and willing to do whatever it took to help us. Boarding passes were hand-written. Upon checking our baggage the woman typed in LIM instead of ILM which meant our bags were heading for Lima Peru not Wilmington North Carolina! This screw-up was revealed to us upon arriving in Atlanta. Overall not a good experience with the airport or maybe it was just KLM/Delta. Who knows. I was not impressed.,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Bandung,airport,Henri Bemelmans,5/20/2018,The new airport is much better than the old but the issue with taxis remains. The military controls the airport and hence which taxis are used. No meters and extortionate fares. Better off walking 5 minutes south on road outside arrivals (right angle to airport terminal) and pickup a bluebird or AA cab from there. Clean and metered. Pity the Government does not stop in and do something about this as it is a horrible welcome to what is otherwise a friendly and interesting city and region.,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Bangkok Don Muang,airport,D Barter,6/2/2022,"The domestic terminal is better than the international, seemingly having been refurbished during Covid. Both have adequate food options. Plenty of seating. Clean. Domestic departures. At security beware the overzealous and brusque female personnel with their metal detector wands. A small coin inadvertently left in a pocket will immediately incur their wrath. Perhaps their rigorous practical training could also include occasional use of the words 'please' and 'thank you'. Polite manners to avoid confrontations are as important when dealing with foreigners as they are with the locals. International departures: leave plenty of time for passport control and security which is efficient but there can be long queues. At last, the the BTS runs out to Don Muang and the station is not too far away - making the old taxi lottery system a thing of the past.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,39 reviewsW James,10/12/2019,"Hollywood Burbank Airport is a perfectly splendid airport, and a not-so-perfectly-spendid airport, simultaneously. What do I mean? Well, first, Long Beach is my favorite airport in the Los Angeles area, with Burbank a respectable second, I find them to be more pleasant than (especially) LAX and even Orange County. The feeling of flying into and out of Burbank is one of aviation yesteryear of sorts, think sort of like the show, ""Wings."" Driving onto the airport and following the signage to the terminal and car rental return is simple and straightforward. Drop-off and pick-up areas in the front of the terminal are simply and clearly delineated, though sometimes difficult to access given the constant flow of traffic in that area (which is still nowhere remotely as bad as LAX, but, remember, Burbank's terminal is old). Walking into the airport, you clearly have a feeling of 1930s-era, Art Deco architecture, something really ""Americana"" and unique even as American airports go. Check-in for either American or Southwest is a breeze, no sarcasm, no ""lip service,"" all business, but still pleasant! Seating and flooring pre and post-security is a little aged and worn in some areas and could really stand to be improved, but they're also no worse than much of LAX. Shopping and dining options are very limited even by small airport standards, surprising, considering that we are still in the greater Los Angeles area after all. The staff at the car rental facilities are generally helpful and professional, though actually friendliness is hit-and-miss, I've never met anybody rude there, though. TSA personnel seem to be the most truly hit-and-miss, either ""sugar-coatedly"" friendly and jovial, or aloof and grumpy almost to the point of being rude. To TSA's credit here, though, they are amazingly efficient even by small airport standards, whether you have TSA Pre-Check or not. There has been a proposal by the airport authority to effectively construct a new terminal in the place of the existing terminal, which would be a shame to have materialize with the charming existing terminal could just be renovated and modernized while keeping its rich history in tact. In all, Burbank is a good airport with some notable warts, but positive experiences to be had, hard to rave about, but still easy to like.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,10/23/2011,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports. It's easier to use than Rio or Sao Paulo at least until you get to the cramped gate area.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Altenburg,airport,R Heelas,10/13/2008,As with many small airports travelling to and from Altenburg is a pleasure. The terminal is about as big as a Drive-Through burger restaurant and there is free parking within 30m of the building. This airport is an excellent option for passengers travelling to or from the southern part of the former East Germany or to the north of Bavaria (I live in Bamberg and the drive is much shorter and more pleasant than to the next nearest Ryanair airport at Frankfurt Hahn). On the downside if you arrive early the Duty Free shop is very small and the restaurant is basic but the staff are friendly.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Ballina Byron,airport,C Tudehope,7/15/2010,For the number of passengers it handles the Ballina-Byron airport really isn't that big. For most of the day it's fairly quiet with REX operating its 36 seaters 3 times per day. However within a 2 hour timeframe both Virgin and Jetstar operate their 180-seaters into and out of the airport which causes it to almost reach breaking point. The departure lounge isn't in any way big enough to cater for a full flight and the ventilation leaves a bit to be desired. The ground crew from all airlines were friendly enough and the cafe wasn't too bad. However when comparing Ballina the second largest market out of Sydney to other regional airports like Albury Dubbo Newcastle and Canberra it really is sub-par. It needs freshening up made more open and indeed made bigger to cater for any future growth that may come about! It gets the job done-but it's nothing special-and definitely isn't inviting.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Bangkok Don Muang,airport,Leo Vist,9/16/2020,"On the 4th of March, I was flying back to Bangkok from Tokyo. At the end of an 8 hour flight with N95 masks, I was exhausted, and didn't do the usual ""always look back the trolley"" search that I normally would. I didn’t realize it until I was getting ready the next morning, that I have lost my expensive skincare that I bought for mom as a gift. Brand new and properly packed in the duty free bag. I panicked and thought there was no hope that I would find the goods. I called the airport just to try our luck. The airport staff told me to describe the items that we lost and would contact us after checking with the lost and found department. Only a few moments later, the airport called me that they found my items at the lost and found. A janitor had turned them in. We can arrange to collect the items anytime. It all seemed crazy to me because the items were in perfect condition. I was so grateful and could not believe that my stuff would be able to be found. The airport staff were extremely helpful and nice. It made my day and I still feel so thankful even until today.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

No bank for exchange in arrivals. Many car rental companies. No sign for special rental car parking area. When returning a rented car you risk entering the normal parking (which is meters before but separate from the rental car parking area) and you will be asked to pay even if you make a U-turn to leave the parking immediately!

Bucharest Otopeni,airport,Raul Nica,1/16/2024,"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience. The airport was eerily empty, creating a rather unwelcoming atmosphere. But the real frustration began with the inefficiency in handling our luggage. It took them over an hour to offload our bags from the plane. This caused us to miss our connecting flight.

Bahrain,airport,A Kaleel,4/28/2023,"Bahrain's new airport has given me a satisfying experience as I found the place really simple, big enough, and neat. I must say that it seemed also like a plane-spotters paradise since they have these huge glass windows that gives an almost unobstructed view by gate area, and also a rooftop experience from The Terrace. In my point of view, the only downside is the limited Internet and when you have not enough money to spend for food. I'm also glad that the playroom at the bottom of their huge, central LED screen is free for everyone to enjoy and wheelchair accessible as well which is absolutely a big plus. Also, the airport didn't seem too crowded and I hope it stays that way.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

When I finally cleared the initial security screening and checked in for my flight I commenced queuing once more the queue which was very slow became absolutely chaotic when people entered the queue from the sides and no airport staff or security staff intervened. The entire experience showed a level of inability in the security or airport staff to ensure orderly queuing and safety of passengers. I will be very reluctant to use this airport again.,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Bologna Marconi,airport,Geraldine Farrell,8/17/2023,"Marconi Express monorail service: Surprisingly poor service upon arrival at Bologna Airport from Bologna Centrale. My ticket wouldn't open the gate. I wasn't alone in this as a few others were the same including a man with a baby in a pram. Some got through the gate easily, others with difficulty. My ticket failed to work. There was no visible way to call for help or assistance. We were there and prisoners to the closed gate. The trapped father with pram sent his wife for help; from trying to get out first to help arriving took over 14 minutes. The staff member, when she arrived, was rude and brusque telling that we must have done it wrong. I am not aware of having done anything incorrect but, if I had, there had been no avenue for assistance. Having travelled the world, I can normally cope with a automated ticket! The Marconi Express Experience was very disappointing and actually quite anxiety inducing. At the point that I got through, the poor man with pram was still blocked and it took another 5 minutes for him to get through. I waited with him as he did not speak Italian. The assistant was rude and unpleasant in her responses offering no support or apology. As I waited, I watched another family trying to get through from the other side to go towards Bologna and also struggling. When they eventually got through, they also needed immediate assistance as their child got on the train they, with their luggage, struggled to get on. The doors closed and neither parent was on board. All anxiety inducing stuff! I'll look to get a taxi next time unless the service improves.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier.

Blackpool,airport,Peter Walker,7/3/2013,The poor lighting inside makes it look as if you have just walked into a fairground dark ride. The gents toilet (singular you'll notice) always smells of something unpleasant. The advertising blurb tells of facilities that are never open and it has a help desk that is manned only when the staff feel like it which is as good as never. It looks like an uncompleted job on which the builders have walked off because the service pipes are all exposed and there is not so much as a false ceiling to hide it all. It has been like this for decades. To then ask the public to pay £10 each to refurbish something that should be done out of the operating profits over many years is a disgrace. Forget expecting to see a terminal akin to those airy ones with glass and steel as at `proper` airports this is a chicken-shed inspired windowless dark oblong box. You are unable to see any aircraft from inside or outside so plane spotters stay away.,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Some of them are merely there to check the size of the hand bags (several people for one gate) and are not helpful at all. In some cases they don’t speak English. I’ve also experienced rude and condescending attitude towards me while not even addressing me directly, which was humiliating. As a customer, this is not the treatment one would expect.

The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast.

I have been in smaller airports with much better facilities.

Accra Kotoka,airport,Ama Afari,7/16/2021,"Warning to other travellers using Kotoka airport drop off. There's a deliberate system of entrapment. We arrived at the airport to drop off my friend who was travelling. As she had to pick up a copy of her Covid test result we dropped her off and was told by one of the staff that we should rather drive around to the other side by the bus stop. We drove around the area waiting for her to call us that she was ready so we could drive her to the new side of the airport to catch her flight. When she was ready, we drove to the side of the road (near the bus stop) where the staff member told us to go to. Another member of staff then proceeded to stand by the car, said you can't pick up here and called over two other men who put a clamp on our wheel. This happened in the space of less than 30 seconds. We were shocked of course and told them she would be late for her flight to which he responded he doesn't care. They demanded we pay 150 cedis. While we were talking to the men, several cars parked in the same spot and picked up passengers. We asked why their cars weren't being clamped too. They stood by and let these cars pick up and drive off. They continued to refuse to unclamp our car. We paid the 150 cedis because we didn't want our friend to miss her flight. The attendant then tried to refuse to give us a receipt for the fine we just paid which led to more arguing. During this time one of the attendants used his hand to push our brother who then pushed him back. Us ladies had to stand between the men to stop them physically fighting. He obviously wanted to pocket the cash. We dropped our friend and enquired with other airport staff where the main office is for the enforcers. We spoke to two men  at the office who said they were supervisors. They listened to our story and I showed them the video clip. They didn't offer any assistance except to say we should come back tomorrow morning to speak to the general manager. Looks like everyone there is probably taking a portion of the money from this operation they have going on.

Aspen Pitkin County,airport,B Frank,4/18/2020,"We were returning back home to Virginia via ORD and our ASE to ORD flight got cancelled. The main lobby and check-in/ticketing area of Aspen Airport does not have a vending machine for even water. TSA did not allow already checked-in passengers to go through security and wait in the gates section due to some ""safety"" issue due to overcrowding in the gates area. We had to wait five hours. Twice I went to the bathroom and through a windowed door you could see the gate area with FEW people while the front of the airport building was overcrowded with unhappy and angry passengers. I already sent my complaint to American Airlines. This issue of no water, soda or food for hours is not acceptable in todays world. For sure I have no desire to visit Aspen due to this awful airport and airline experience.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bloemfontein,airport,Abraham Faure,9/19/2007,Bloemfontein airport is currently undergoing improvements to its buildings and facilities. This is with a view to the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup to be held in South Africa. I love this little airport because there is an air of excitement and a bustle of activity. While the upstairs cafeteria is undergoing improvements there is a downstairs cafeteria where refreshments may be purchased. The airport personnel are some of the friendliest i have ever met! Their are ample parking and car rental facilities available.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Mark Evans,10/31/2003,One for the historians of airport architecture a real time-warp from the 1960s and earlier. This was the original pre-WW2 Berlin airport. The paucity of flights serving Tempelhof make for a very stress-free environment. Emerging from the terminal one finds oneself in an ordinary residential street the facade of the terminal blending in with the neighbouring apartment blocks. The U-Bahn station is just 300 m away and one is in the heart of Berlin cheaply and in double-quick time. But look again at that facade towards the top: there's a gap. Wasn't that where the old regime's notorious symbol used to stand?,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

Bremen,airport,L Addis,2/10/2009,I thought this airport was lovely. Outside are the cobbled roads and tram link into center. In the main airport terminal the facilities are excellent.

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,J Segal,1/30/2008,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Barcelona,airport,1 reviewsT Russell,10/24/2024,"Without doubt one of the worst immigration experiences you will get in Europe. Under resourced, and primitive is the only way to describe it. It’s not like flights arrive randomly. These are international scheduled flights, and they have amble ability to plan to resource. If you are Non- European, be prepared for an arrival or departure nightmare. Especially in the mornings when all US and Middle East flights arrive around the same time… It’s like Barcelona missed the digital revolution! I love living in Barcelona, but seriously considering alternative travel routes",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bremen,airport,3 reviewsAndrew Coogans,6/28/2015,"Flew in and out of the dedicated Ryanair terminal (Terminal E) at Bremen Airport, but also spent some time in the other main terminal complex. Upon arrival, the Immigration desks were efficient, but the queuing area seemed to be slightly small for a full Boeing 737-800, and indeed there was a small area outside to accommodate a queue. The terminal seems to be a converted hangar, and serves its purpose well. Baggage collection time was fine. Amazingly close tram stop outside, along with office blocks and hotels. It feels like the airport is simply another building in the middle of the city. The tram is a very convenient and cheap way into the city centre. On departure, we walked through the main terminal to get to Terminal E. It appeared very spacious and quiet. There appeared to be adequate check in desks for the flights that were operating and the whole place seemed very tranquil. Terminal E itself was busy. About a 10 minute wait at Security and then the gate area seemed very crowded, particularly for the non-Schengen area flights, of which there were 2 departing within 5 minutes of each other. Still, I was impressed with this airport and would have no issues about using it again.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Albuquerque,airport,39 reviewsW Jackson,4/19/2022,"ABQ is a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements. For starters: If you have TSA Pre-Check here, you're golden. Security is an efficient and friendly process. If you don't have Pre-Check, then the service, at least for a small airport, can be quite non-communicative, abrasive and slow. The pueblo-inspired architecture and interior design of the airport render it one of the most beautiful small airports in the USA, and the post-security viewing area of the runway and mountains is the sort of thing that more airports in this country need. However, it's not always easy to enjoy the design and the views when the tile and carpet flooring and seating throughout the airport are dirty and, for a lack of better words, dilapidated and outdated. Speaking of seating, there really isn't enough of it, in my opinion. The signage directing you to amenities, services and locations throughout the airport is helpful, but also outdated. The dining and shopping options are fine for a small airport, so no real complaints. Some people complain about the rental car facility being separate from the terminal and requiring a shuttle bus, but, honestly, the bus runs frequently and the ride is pretty short. Everything is easily accessible from I-25 and downtown Albuquerque. With a little modernization and polishing, ABQ has the potential be as good as new again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Patricia Merlo,1/2/2024,"It is astonishing that Barbados Grantley Airport is still as unfriendly and disorganised as other reviewers described it years ago. Although we were in transit, we had to have all our belongings scanned again by customs and this was done incredibly slowly and with unfriendly, harsh orders from the officials. The most amazing thing was that they shouted at us because some of us were carrying rum in sealed bags from Grenada Duty Free. They treated the people concerned as if they were serious criminals. The bags were confiscated. The people concerned asked what would happen to them now. We were told that we would get them back at the gate. At the gate, the staff knew nothing about it. They just shrugged their shoulders and kept the passengers waiting for about half an hour. Then an employee set off, slow as a snail, and finally came back with 3 bags. He crawled off again and brought a few more bags. Everyone got on the plane, even those who hadn't got their bags back. The crew finally took care of the matter and the rest were brought onto the plane. The passengers were accused by the airport staff of not having listened. However, we were still unable to take off as the airport's passenger system suddenly went on strike and several officials had to go through the aircraft to count us several times. After an hour's delay, we saw Barbados getting smaller under the aircraft. I will definitely not be returning to this inhospitable airport, no way!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bandung,airport,10 reviewsDexter Lee,10/8/2016,"I've come across old reviews of Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and I have to say that the airport today doesn't look as bad as it used to be. The new terminal building is a welcome addition for an airport that handles nearly 90 flights a day. There is a security check for both international and domestic passengers before the check-in, and another one at the entrances to the international and domestic departure halls. Checks were quick and cleared the immigration checkpoint in less than a minute. Apparently most of the shops after the security area are in the domestic departure hall. The new international departure hall consists of only one gate (Gate 3i), a tiny magazine stand, a kids playground and a food kiosk that looks more like a mini warehouse. There is free wi-fi to keep people occupied, charging points for mobile phones, as well as plenty of seats. Since there are few international flights the international departure area doesn't feel crowded. As the airport is tiny there are no aerobridges, so you have to walk to the plane rain or shine. While this can be annoying for some, it is pretty great for aviation enthusiasts (you can get really close to planes that are taxiing to the runway). Would be happy to use Bandung Airport again.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Bournemouth,airport,Shaun Mills,2/24/2020,"As a favour to my very good friends who were having a short break in Malta following 25yrs of being together i offered to drop them off at the airport, their flight was at 1pm so we arranged i would drop them off at 11am to save them having to pay for a taxi. I had never done this before and as they were literally travelling with two small pieces of cabin luggage the plan was to drop and run as you would expect, however once my friends had got out of the car i was forced by a very unsympathetic car park attendant (we will call him that to be polite) into the car park as apparently that was what you need to do for drop offs. I had assumed there would be a tiny window of time for such purposes (i.e. 5mins or so) which would be free of charge but i was then charged an extortionate fee of £3 for literally taking a token from the entrance barrier and going straight to the payment machine! I think this is absolutely disgusting and just another way of ripping the public off when they are trying to do someone a favour, there definitely should be a small area for these sort of situations allowing people the 10-20 seconds it takes for someone to get out of the vehicle and collect their baggage from the boot and then leave. When i confronted the 'car park attendant' about this he just shrugged his shoulders and said 'that what it is' with absolutely no sympathy at all, although it is only £3 i feel like i have been robbed as all i needed to do was turn around an leave but as there was another car coming up behind me i did as this man said but had no idea i was going to be charged for obliging him. As you can gather I'm still fuming about this so wanted too make a formal complaint about it and will be contacting the airport directly as well once i can get through .... there is plenty of space there for a drop off point to be put in place so completely outrageous as far as I'm concerned!!!!",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Belgrade,airport,Debra Harsany,5/19/2021,"It was necessary to bring my dog with me back to Canada, from Belgrade via Frankfort to Toronto. She is not used to travelling but I did medicate her as requested by the staff. Booking directions from Lufthansa were to check in the dog at 03.00. No one was available until about 04.30. Transporting animals is stressful and hard, and waiting in the middle of a busy terminal was unacceptable. If the dog had been checked in on time, and normal procedures followed as advised by the airline (covering the cage, placing the cage in a quiet area) there would have been no concerns. Because I was forced to wait for staff to attend, I had to run to catch the plane to Frankfurt. (As a senior citizen, this was not a fun experience.)",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Ashgabat,airport,S King,6/30/2019,"Ashgabat is a big airport with very limited traffic. Arrived very early in the morning and had to queue at the visa desk which took just on two hours. If you don't have a visa prior to arrival you can get one at the airport, the process is quite long and takes a lot of time. First you queue in the visa line and hand over document and passport. Then you queue at the cash desk which can take a lot of time to hand over the money and the tourist tax (which everyone has to pay so this line is the busiest), once done with that back to the visa desk to get the documents back (the cashier desk only accept USD some people had euros which caused some delays. They have to be post 2003 clean and crisp otherwise they won't accept it). They have fingerprint scanners which sometimes work or not. Then immigration which the guy was lovely and was very welcoming, one of the best immigration experiences I have had in a while. Your passport gets checked again before going down the escalator which has an amazing green hand rail. Luggage was waiting for me then go through customs and have passport checked again to leave. Airport officials will ask for bribes and will charge you if your unlucky they also don't give change. It's a cool airport yet it's forbidden to take photos which is strange.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Asturias,airport,Roland Rodriguez,7/5/2010,Went to OVD on a day trip from BCN in mid June 2010 to visit family in nearby Castrillon. I seen the airport evolve for the last thirty years into a very nice compact and efficient operation. Everything is laid out in a logical sequence. You arrive into a small check-in area as there are still less than a half dozen or so carriers that use it go through a quick and orderly screening area and up to the gates. There are various shops to include a regional Asturias gift shop stores transportation outlets and the such. Public areas are clean and not crowded by any means. There is the typical cafe with lots of room and reasonable pricing. We found taxis right outside the terminal along with two bays for ALSA busses running to both Oviedo and Gijon. Be advised that the trip to the provincial cities of Oviedo Gijon and Aviles all take about a half hour or so to get to. All in all a very nice user-friendly airport.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Almeria,airport,Stuart Ward,10/24/2010,Arrival okay queue to go through passport was a bit long. Luggage arrived on the belt as we got though. Limited baggage handlers so for a full charter flight might be longer. About 25 mins from landing to getting in the taxi. Going out the departure hall has been rebuilt much better and quicker. Security still tight big queue to get through. The departure lounge has been rebuilt and access to the rooftop terrace removed. The lounge is much better than the original. As work is going on don't know if there are plans to restore access to the roof. Small snack bar with coffee and rolls at reasonable prices but duty free for local stuff is the same price as supermarkets and imported stuff is more expensive than UK supermarket prices. Wouldn't want to arrive or depart when there are more than 2 charter/scheduled UK flights though. Then it would get overloaded very quickly.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

Then all free, assume due to stop people wandering in and using. Sat by gate 25 now for a full flight back to Manchester and all is fine. Was proper worrying before but it’s been a pleasure.

Blantyre,airport,Wilbert Wolfs,2/2/2009,Arriving at Blantyre's Chileka airport is a colonial experience. Arriving from Johannesburg the airplane is taxied in front of the arrival hall. School classes have already been run out to see the big bird landing. The building has a wooden veranda and there is a special area were people are expected to cheer after the president has landed. The first time I arrived at Chileka the luggage was simply dropped on the tarmac. The passengers had to fight to get their possessions. Of course quite some passengers did not find any luggage at all as it had stayed behind in Jo'burg. Immigration is quite impressive with a lot of stamps in passports and on listings. To get out you have to go through a door then you turn sharply turn left and right. Again left until you bump into the departing passengers and their luggage. Since half a year we have a new arrival hall at our airport.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE

Passport control is fast and hassle free - no fingerprinting or cameras.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Bergen,airport,Peter Thackray,12/13/2016,"A relatively small but busy airport serving a key city on the coast of Norway. Most flights are domestic within Norway. Domestic Arrivals mix with departures and there are 2 baggage belts on the ground floor behind the check-in desks, no specific separation between general public and flying public. On the ground floor there are 2 convenience shops selling snacks, drinks etc and a small café/bar. The Check-in is predominantly self-service with very few staff evident. Upstairs to Security and Departures. The main domestic departures has a few food outlets, a book shop and a convenience shop, there is a further section for International Travellers with full Duty Free options. Most planes land at a gate with pier so little need to be outside. No announcements or ""Last Calls"" are made so you need to look at one of the many monitors to check your flight status.

Albury,airport,C Tudehope,4/18/2010,It's a gorgeous little country airport. The terminal only opened last October and it still has a new smell. There are no queues anywhere and in general all ground staff are friendly and laid back. There is no need to allow excess time because there will be no queues at checkin or at security-the largest planes into the airport only seat 78 people-and they aren't always full. There are lovely large windows with views over the tarmac runway and ranges in the distance (and if it's race day you can see the horses too). The cafe is good although a bit overpriced. It's interesting that whilst Virgin and Qantas passengers have to go through security Rex and Brindabella passengers don't. There are no issues to speak of in this small yet very pleasant airport.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

Billund,airport,Claus Nielsen,2/19/2009,My favourite airport. Fast efficient and very pleasant. Easy to get to easy to navigate check-in and security is always fast and friendly and the lounge above Security is great. Extremely roomy and classy great for work or relaxation even offers open smoker's cabins that don't feel like a cage - and a chess game for those with plenty of time. Almost everywhere in the airport can you overlook the runway and the whole place is just modern roomy and open. The airport size is an advantage without doubt - the distances between parking check-in security lounge gate and flight are minimal so getting in and out is always a pleasure. Much better than Copenhagen in almost all aspects.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Once passed the gate area offers enough space and a bar to wait your boarding time. The only issue which needs to be resolved soon is related to the car parkings.

As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed.

Rude passport control officer. Extremely rude customs officer - she pawed through all my belongings being careful to disarrange them untidily. Then to the greeting area - no chairs to sit in while awaiting my pickup. Entire area filthy. By now I needed a bathroom a janitor directed me to one ""around the corner"" near a loading dock. It smelt of urine and was crawling with ants. Departure: confusing signage shops too few and overpriced at gate (upper level) one goes down a flight of stairs in order to go up a flight of stairs into the airplane. (At the bottom of the flight of stairs some sort of janitor screamed at me to show my passport. Oh well I suppose the boarding process needs more inefficiency. All flights in-&-out were delayed 90 minutes because that morning the radar was ""inoperative.""

Bristol,airport,Colin Milroy,6/23/2023,"Bristol Airport has gone downhill. There was a local pandemic only recently yet the place is absolutely filthy. Toilets, cafe's, and general floor area is terrible. We travelled to Nice airport and Toulouse airport recently and there is zero comparison. A complete embarrassment.

Agadir,airport,Kevin Maslin,8/11/2008,No major problems here. Lots of check-in desks open at inbound passport control so we were processed fairly quickly and directed to the transfer coach within 20 mins. Lots of 'porters' in brown uniform with trolleys offered to take our luggage when we disembarked from the coach on the return journey. We could manage ok but I think they were asking for 10 Dirham (about 70p) to take you all the way to check-in which I considered to be fairly reasonable. We were told that we could not spend our left over Dirhams in the departure lounge so we changed them at the bank (not for sterling but to euros!) in the lobby prior to joining the queue for the scanning machine. As there was only one channel in operation it took quite a while to get through and then we discovered that the shops would accept sterling euros or dirhams! Ho-hum. We had taken our own drinks through as we had been told the airport prices were shockingly expensive (even the so-called duty-free!) but we did buy 3 Snickers bars at 4.5 euros! We were not aware that our flight was overdue by half an hour as announcements were largely in French fairly inaudible and the screens were not very informative. Once the gate was open though we were ushered through to the plane quite quickly.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,E Mabley,10/17/2011,Burbank provides a convenient and easy alternative to LAX although the departure hall in Terminal B is too small to accommodate more than 2 flights at a time.

Berlin Tegel,airport,3 reviewsEthan Phua,1/10/2020,"Berlin Tegel is a very unique airport, both is positive and negative ways. After arriving at Berlin Tegel and disembarking the aircraft, we had to queue up on the jetbridge as the customs checkpoint was right after the jetbridge. A very interesting concept. Right after that was a small baggage carousel, then out of the departures area. This meant that there was basically no departures area. We had to wait quite some time for our baggage. When we returned to to the airport, our check-in process was pretty smooth and the lounge was easily accessible. There was a huge observation deck which spanned the roof of a terminal, offering beautiful views of the runway and tarmac, a good place to spend the time. However, you have to go through a small security check and buy a ticket before entering. Every two gates had its own departure area with seats and its own security checkpoint. This meant snaking queues into the public area each time a flight was boarding, and it was hard to walk around with baggage because there was little space. Inside the tiny departures area, there was insufficient seating and insufficient space for the boarding queue. Everyone was squeezed at the gate and there was absolutely no order or anything. No queues set up.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Beijing Daxing,airport,I Lancaster,12/14/2019,"As might be expected, clean and efficient. In fact, arriving at 07:00 the place was empty - there seemed to be only one other flight arrival around that time. But the gate is a long way from the immigration hall. There are moving walkways but it nonetheless took a while. Then a long wait for baggage. My main gripe, though, and a cautionary note: my Swiss army knife was confiscated at the train station. Carefully packed in checked baggage, never in carry-on, so no problem for the flight. But getting in to the ticket hall for the train to Beijing baggage is inspected and my knife was not allowed. Be warned! This made it an expensive train ticket. I would have enjoyed a coffee and snack but neither airport arrivals or the train station had anywhere open.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

Brindisi,airport,Lawrie Hall,12/24/2008,Brindisi (Salento) is a pleasant fairly new airport spacious enough for the level of fights. The lurid yellow/green fluorescent plastic seats are a bit much and I wouldn't want to encounter them with a hangover. Transit from city centre by bus 'A' costs 80cents (buy tickets in airport or in town from the bar on the way from the railway station to the bus stop in Via C Colombo) and runs half hourly. The snack bar prices are silly. Coffee 60% more than in town bottled beer 150% more (draught beer only 25% more but wasn't available). If your flight is from gate 1 (which the Ryanair flight to STN was) be aware that it is straight in front of passport control meaning that a lot of people can't get through passport control until boarding begins.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

Two young men to one older man no contest here. Foolishly I only spotted the warning signs that the two of them were trouble too late and am grateful that it was only my pocket that was dented.

Cairns,airport,C Steve,4/11/2024,"Cairns International Airport is little more than an oversized bus shelter. Whilst one concedes that it is a low-usage terminal with less than 8 flights per day (excluding mining charters), there is a lot that can be done to improve this airport. There is a distinct lack of working charging ports, noting that the USB ports adjacent to the cafe have been disabled. Tables and chairs are dirty/sticky. There is only one very expensive and oversubscribed café (ie, long queues to purchase over-priced, average quality food). There is one duty free store if that is your thing. There was a business lounge several years ago, but it has been long vacated with no immediate plans to reopen (this might change if there are more flights from full-service carriers in the future). There is no seating whatsoever near the boarding gates. There was no wi-fi coverage during my visit. On the positive front, customs/immigration/quarantine both on departure and arrival are rapid and staffed by friendly officials. It's a vast improvement on the horrendous queues in SYD, MEL and BNE. But as far as I'm concerned this is the only reason to transit through CNS Intl. In short, once you clear customs there is nothing of any interest, and no Wi-Fi coverage.

You have to get somebody to take you to the front desk through a little back hallway and tip them.

Nobody tells you the procedure, join this queue then shuffle along only to be told you should have gone to the luggage weigh-in queue first. Weigh luggage then rejoin back of check in queue. Told to go to security, shuffle along for a bit then someone asks for departure card. Leave security queue, go to desk where you collect and fill departure card then rejoin back of security queue. Suggest check in desk staff give you a departure card so you will know to fill it in before going through security. Takes a while to shuffle through that and go through immigration departure check then security check. All took about one and a half hours. At gate we were divided into groups 1-5. Not enough seats for group 5 although most passengers are in this group. Infrastructure is very impressive and no doubt they will eventually streamline procedures. Sign posting would be a good start. Shopping and dining facilities are mostly not yet open so I cannot comment on this aspect yet. So, first taste of new terminal: not half bad.

When checking in for our departing flight the official who had to ""pat me down"" for a follow-up security check (the machine beeped when I went through) apologized for having to do so and thanked me for accommodating the security process!

Plenty of seating. Clean. Domestic departures. At security beware the overzealous and brusque female personnel with their metal detector wands. A small coin inadvertently left in a pocket will immediately incur their wrath. Perhaps their rigorous practical training could also include occasional use of the words 'please' and 'thank you'. Polite manners to avoid confrontations are as important when dealing with foreigners as they are with the locals. International departures: leave plenty of time for passport control and security which is efficient but there can be long queues.

Almaty,airport,B Adams,4/7/2018,"My first time transiting in Almaty. Kazakhstan, being an resource rich country, I expected that the airport of their largest city to be at least an international airport. I was most disappointed. 1) The business class lounge - guests must pay $26/pax to have snacks. All drinks are chargeable except for hot water, tea and instant coffee. There is no shower and no service. The ladies who work there really could not be bothered to serve anyone except to remind any guests who walk nearby the snack table that the snacks were chargeable. And guests are not allowed to bring drink/food from outside. Air Astana really needs to build their own lounge instead of using one provided by the airport. Being a Emerald frequent flyer under One World, I know I am spoilt at the First Class Lounges around the world. But this lounge in Almaty borderlines to be offensive. 2) Stairs, stairs and more stairs. This airport cannot be used by those who have disability or travel with baby strollers. There are stairs everywhere - first down from the air-bridge to transfer security, then up the stairs again to the gates. There is actually an elevator - but their are locked and guests are not allowed to use it. 3) Limited choices of food - there is only snacks and coffees. Do not plan to have a dinner in this airport while waiting for your flight. 4) Service - Lack of it. The Air Astana team is helpful. But other than them, service is so poor from the security team, to immigration as well as the waiting staff at those food stalls. Overall - avoid this airport if you have a choice.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Almeria,airport,Dan Thorneycroft,8/25/2006,Reading some of the other reports of Almeria airport I have to say that I must have been lucky on the twenty or so times I have used the airport because I have not had any problems to complain about. The only serious problem which needs to be highlighted is the pilfering of baggage which happens. In view of the serious security problems at British airports someone in a foreign airport who can steal items from baggage could just as easily be putting something in! Almeria to Stansted appears to be the main problem and whilst the pilfering could be taking place at Stansted this is unlikely due to the limited amount of time the bags are available to the people doing the pilfering. The bags are out of sight at Almeria for up to 1.5 hours before the flight.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Bloemfontein,airport,Gareth Bronkhorst,9/12/2005,A very small airport with a few facilities including a shop and a upstairs restaurant. They have several car hire firms to choose from if you are intending to rent a car. What was quite strange was that the arrivals and departure hall is in the same part of the airport. Check in was very speedy and over in less than a minute. The good thing is that you will not be subject to very long queues and passing through security is quite fast. If you happen to be at the airport alone take some reading material as there is not much activity and you might get bored fast.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE

Beauvais,airport,S Hunter,9/25/2024,"Having spent far too much time of my trip to Paris looking at reviews of BVA and becoming convinced that I'd definitely miss my flight/my luggage would be pulled apart/I'd have to stand for 4-5 hours with no rest, to say I was pleasantly surprised by my airport experience would be an understatement. Beauvais is a hub for budget airlines. No one should be under any illusion that you're flying out of CDG or another mega airport in a capital city. Could the departure hall use a lick of paint? Probably. Could a few more benches be put in? Absolutely. But as a functioning airport with many flights departing at similar times, it manages the best it can. We arrived at the airport early due to all of the fear-mongering in reviews, but it allowed us to see that the airport tries its best to manage the flow of traffic. There are screens over security confirming when you'll be able to go through passport control in relation to your flight time (approx. 2.5 hours for us, in line with the bag drop opening), and from there through to the end of security, it was barely even 5 minutes until we were in duty free. As I removed my liquids and electricals in advance (as nearly all airports expect and clearly have signposted, as is the same in BVA), there were no issues with security. Duty free is admittedly sparse, but there were signs up confirming that maintenance work was ongoing. The toilets were adequate, and there was a café open for use, as well as vending and hot drinks machines. There were plug sockets (FYI - not usb ports) and, in the grand scheme of things, a fair number of benches - there are 5 departure gates, and 2 of those are in a separate area, so the space is distributed fairly. In fact, the only issues that I could see occurring were from fellow passengers themselves! People with luggage double the size of the restrictions were being asked to pay the fee at the gate, but this should not be a surprise for anyone who spends even 30 seconds looking at their boarding card information. Likewise, an outgoing flight was held, but this was due to passengers being late to the gate (the call was done in English, French and the language of the flight destination, so there really were no excuses). If people try to blame the airport for this, then they should be taking a longer look at themselves. I'm ultimately reviewing BVA for what it is; a budget friendly space to travel for those of us who don't want to break the bank.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Biarritz,airport,J Robinson,8/19/2018,"This is not an airport with lavish facilities and there's little need for them to have them.

Just 1 or 2 toilets which are rather small, but again for the amount of people using it, I do not consider it a problem. Small area to play for kids, and you just walk about 200 meters to the airplane which will be parked directly in front of the departure hall. Very convenient, quick security check and baggage drop off and it's easily accessible with both car and public transport (bus), which will depart twice every hour and will take you about 30 minutes to downtown. Wi-Fi does not work all the time but when you restart it, it will be working again.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Albuquerque,airport,Shannon Matwiyoff,6/28/2021,"Very frustrating - today 6/27, 11.30 am, B gates going through pre-check TSA my husband was returning with our son (12) to San Diego. The lady at TSA said “our son couldn’t go through security without an ID”. Patently false - he flew RT to Texas the week prior. This is a training issue and she almost caused them to miss their flight! Please train your staff!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Addis Ababa,airport,Ralph Elsaesser,3/12/2024,"While flying with Ethiopian Airlines is rather reliable and straight-forward (in mostly a little bit outdated machines), the Airport is difficult. Checking in is a joke, people do not queue up, no-one guides you, and after the first security check you're covered in dust and dirt. If you then reach the departure hall, it looks not too bad (unless your gate is downstairs) but if you decide to take a drink, your name should be Elon Musk or so. I just observed that a young father was charged 20 Dollars for heating up his baby's milk. You have to pay 10 dollars for 0.4 liters of beer and the food is a nightmare (I must know it because in May 2023 I was not allowed to enter the country and stayed 36 hours at the airport). To summarize, you are treated as cattle but you pay as a king.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bangkok Don Muang,airport,Leo Vist,9/16/2020,"On the 4th of March, I was flying back to Bangkok from Tokyo. At the end of an 8 hour flight with N95 masks, I was exhausted, and didn't do the usual ""always look back the trolley"" search that I normally would. I didn’t realize it until I was getting ready the next morning, that I have lost my expensive skincare that I bought for mom as a gift. Brand new and properly packed in the duty free bag. I panicked and thought there was no hope that I would find the goods. I called the airport just to try our luck. The airport staff told me to describe the items that we lost and would contact us after checking with the lost and found department. Only a few moments later, the airport called me that they found my items at the lost and found. A janitor had turned them in. We can arrange to collect the items anytime. It all seemed crazy to me because the items were in perfect condition. I was so grateful and could not believe that my stuff would be able to be found. The airport staff were extremely helpful and nice. It made my day and I still feel so thankful even until today.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Beijing Capital,airport,Cecilia Leung,12/20/2024,"Extremely rude and unhelpful staff who appear to be impatient and intolerant of people who can't understand or speak Chinese. They assumed anyone with a Chinese-looking face would be able to speak their language. How wrong! This guy with glasses who was manning the airport subway counter yelled at me just because I was unable to comprehend Chinese. Instead of expecting others to know his language, he should learn how to speak proper English himself since he is working at an airport that deals with international arrivals and departures. Not knowing English is as good as being illiterate. It is precisely because of people like him that makes tourists feel uneasy and unwelcomed in a city like Beijing. Please do not discriminate against foreigners who can't speak your language.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bangkok Don Muang,airport,R Howe,1/18/2020,"Great experience. Almost zero queues at immigration in and out, minimal wait for baggage. Good facilities. Clean. No wait for taxi downtown. Lots of seating. Reasonable WiFi. Pleasantly surprised. Much better than BKK, which was horrendous last time I went through.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Hans Berschneider,4/14/2004,Tempelhof is Berlin's pre WWII airport and is one of the older operational airports in Europe It's an arrchitectural treasure. It's also a friendly nice and peaceful airport. Unfortunately they are going to shut it down in the next few years because of lack of travel demand and because it is in the located in the middle of a densely populated residential area.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Baltimore Washington,airport,S Kaylen,12/29/2023,"After arriving at BWI Airport around 5 PM from Detroit, I had to wait for two hours after touchdown for the handlers to begin bringing out the luggage and my suitcase was not among those that arrived. Upon enquiry at the Lost Luggage room, I was told that the plane was too heavy, so my suitcase (which was not anywhere near being overweight) had been randomly selected to be rerouted (thrown off the plane) to another airport. It would therefore now arrive at 10 PM from Chicago Midway. So I was given two choices: wait at the airport till 10 PM for my bag to arrive, or go home and wait ""two days"" for them to ""Overnight"" the bag to me via FedEX.  Really, how much extra fuel would it take for my normal-weight suitcase to be included in the original flight? I opted for the former option and prepared to settle in for a three-hour vigil at the BWI airport. At 10 PM I was at the conveyor belt that ground staff said I should stand at to wait for my suitcases. They said the plane would be 12 minutes late. And so I waited. Eventually another showed up. She was there to pick up her elderly mother who was on that plane from Chicago. She expressed concern as it was the first time her mother was flying using a walker. I would periodically check with ground crew if I was really standing at the right place. They always replied with the same thing: when the suitcases start arriving from Chicago they would be at belt 3. But it wasn't until well after 11 PM that I saw the belt I should be standing it was now Belt 4. The ground crew had not bothered to tell me about the change, even though I was standing near their desk and in regular conversation with them. The bags started rolling in and by 11:43 PM I was finally able to retrieve my suitcase. When I questioned the ground crew about the delay, they were very defensive and said that it wasn't as late as I thought because it took a long time for the plane to reach a gate, and they count the delay from the moment it does so. So there you are. This was my unplanned adventure on December 27. I hope your experience with Southwest Airlines and the BWI Airport is better than mine has been of late.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Amsterdam Schiphol,airport,Harry Chapman,2/9/2025,"I have flown through here a number of times in the past year and it is disorganised and awful. The signs are often wrong, they divert you to different places and the staff are rude. I fly a lot and it is one of the worst airports, there are many better ones in much poorer countries. A leading European economy shouldn’t have this kind of chaos",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,Klaus Malling Olsen,3/7/2016,"During rush-hours (evening) Kotoka Airport felt very crowded, but check-in was surprising quick, as well as security check, this works well if you arrive at least 3 hours before departure. Rush hours here mean departure within half an hour for several wide-body plans, creating a severe lack of seating and extremely long rows of slowly boarding passengers, making you realize that you are in a far too small airport to handle several aircrafts with a capacity of 3-400 passengers within a short time limit. Thi is especially the case when you arrive. The rows of arriving passengers at the immigration was long enough to last for almost one hour, and was followed by usual slow deliverance of luggage. Furthermore, the staff controlling the yellow cards for vaccinations are not very well inset in the rules, including the knowledge that persons over a certain age are not required vaccination against yellow fever. However, as a whole Kotoka was not too bad an experience, just accept some more time than required in more updated and modern airports.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Burnie Wynyard,airport,G Wilson,3/14/2008,Small NW Tasmanian airport with flights to Melbourne & Tasmanian destinations. Neat & tidy with easy check-in & baggage collection. Small cafe/shop & enough seating for size of aircraft using airport. Not a bad little airport,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Buenos Aires,airport,4 reviewsR Sanyal,1/21/2020,"The airport is quite a distance from the City. It took me about 45 minutes. It is a modern airport with all the services you expect. Let me speak first about the arrival. We arrived early in the morning. Other flights had arrived too. The lines snaked and coiled for passengers to clear immigration. It took nearly an hour. That, however, was enough time for our checked luggage to arrive in baggage claim. Our bags were put through a scanning machine by customs and we stepped out from shops to a concourse full of tranportation services. We purchased a taxi service (USD30.00) to our hotel. A taxi driver escorted us out of the terminal building, made us wait at a spot while he went off to fetch his taxi. It all worked. On departure, which was late at night, we arrived in the evening. Check in was smooth. Security check was also smooth. Lines to get your passport stamped again on departure moved fast. The American Airlines lounge was jammed with people what with five flights to the U.S. departing in a short span of time. The lounge offered a large variety of food and drinks but not enough place sit and relax. Only one major shop selling duty free items. Very few, if any, ""Made in Argentina"" products except for wine. There is a McDonald's. As is the case, an additional security check is conducted just before boarding the flight to the U.S. with the carry on bags opened up by security men and women wearing rubber gloves. There are quite a few chairs in the departure area. This is the primary airport to enter Argentina - so if you are visiting this country, it is next to impossible to avoid it. I would be happy not to use this airport again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
