Brussels Charleroi,airport,1 reviewsMarc Harris,9/28/2024,"Really not sure what all the hate and negativity is about. Through security in six minutes. Through border control in two minutes. Loads of seats. Really good quality restaurants and bars which weren’t an absolute rip off. Toilets are only pay toilets before departures. Then all free, assume due to stop people wandering in and using. Sat by gate 25 now for a full flight back to Manchester and all is fine. Was proper worrying before but it’s been a pleasure. Only negative was went in wrong car park dropping the hire car back, but that my my fault.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Aalborg,airport,K Fischer,8/4/2010,Very quick check-in and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Bergerac,airport,Richard Lindsay,6/24/2013,This airport is small so whilst access is good facilities are very limited. Airside there are only 2-3 vending machine so if you want anything to eat or drink best use the bar Landside. Do not carry tins (eg Duck Confit Pate etc) that are greater than 100g in hand luggage - they will be confiscated at security.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Boise,airport,Diana Neill,1/4/2020,"Upon arrival at the airport, there was a huge line but only a few staff. I went through Alaska Airlines. It was very confusing where I was supposed to go because there were so many people and so many different lines. The lines didn't look like lines at all. I checked in at the kiosk, got my boarding pass, then a lady who was walking around helping people said I needed to get a bag tag printed. So I had to go back in line and wait to get the tag printed. I had to pay a $30 fee, even though I have elite status and have never had to pay a bag fee before. I had never gone through the kiosk before. Then when I got to the front, she said I needed to wait to answer some questions. After standing there several minutes and seeing many people get helped who were there after me, I was finally helped. They just needed emergency contact name and number. Then going to the line for the security check, there were about 300 people there. I got to the airport an hour before my flight and when I got to the gate, they were already boarding. Seriously, they need more organization and more staff to help customers.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bari Palese,airport,C Richards,7/22/2019,"Flew with Alitalia on both arrival and departure used jetbridge, which was a plus. It is compact and functional. There is train service to city center. It's quite convenient. Security line moved quite efficiently during my Saturday morning departure. The space is quite small on airside. Seats are located at the gate where boarding passengers would walk past/line up while you wait. Bari will need to expand the airport very soon.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Alicante,airport,Mats Hemmingsson,9/11/2023,"Absolutely terrible. Obsolete information and hard to find your way around. When we came to return our rental car it was very difficult to understand were to go, and we went the wrong way twice. And we were not alone. Then, no restaurant except Burger K. before you come to the gates. And they made the entrance to the gates long by forcing everyone to go trough the tax free shopping area.  In the gate area there was very late info of witch gate to go to.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ajaccio,airport,O Beyr,10/20/2008,Nice little airport right next to the sea and beaches. There is not much you can expect during waiting time it is only a regional airport. Only point of criticism: access to security control. At the time I was there queues formed randomly without any guidance between around and between counters which led to some confusion and aggression as some people got away without waiting.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Brasilia,airport,G Castro,9/23/2009,Brasilia airport is probably the best Brazilian airport. The shopping/eating area is good and with a great variety. The information desk is good and people friendly not to mention the architecture that is beautiful. The bad things about the airport are Transportation - Buses not as frequent as they should be. No metro or train. Boarding area - once you pass Security the airport is too crowded and not having the same amenities as the pre-boarding area make the journey less comfortable. Too small for the traffic it has. Drop off/Pick Up passengers: There is a lack of enforcing the laws and people park in the drop off areas making it difficult to approach sometimes.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Bergen,airport,P Thackray,2/20/2018,"New airport building opened in August 2017. Large and airy construction gives a positive feeling to airport experience. International Arrivals involve a bit of walking to the Baggage Reclaim and International Arrivals which happen on the ground floor. Car Rental, Café and Bureau de Change all within the terminal building. Bus, Taxi and Tram are out by the front door. Undercover walkways connect to short stay car parks. Departures are on the 1st floor with the usual automated check-in. Security pretty quick with more capacity when things get busy. The Departure Lounge overlooks the end of the runway and has air bridges to most departure gates - some bus departures for small aircraft parked remotely. Good selection of shops and cafes. A big improvement on the old terminal building.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Bremen,airport,Jurgen Arnold,10/8/2007,As living in the north of The Netherlands Bremen airport is a good alternative for Amsterdam. Recently flown from the new low cost Ryanair terminal. Its basic clean and blue! There is a multipurpose shop which sells everything from a to z at somewhat inflated prices and small coffee shop. Seating is mostly in plastic chairs which you could find at your local dentist. Reasonable but we had an early flight so it was not so crowded. Would not like to be there when its get full. There are also some paid internet terminals. The airport is well situated from the city center and freeway from the parking garage you are within 3 minutes in the main terminal building. Bremen is still a great small airport but they need to get some other low cost airlines on board besides Ryanair.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Auckland,airport,2 reviewsBarnaby Emmerson,11/2/2024,"Nice and clean airport. As an avgeek I love watching planes and there are so many big windows next to restaurants to watch planes. Security wasn’t long. The check-in staff were really nice. On arrival, Immigration was really quick and baggage claim was surprisingly quick. Very quick and free wifi.",POSITIVE,Negative
Belgrade,airport,45 reviewsDiogo Freitas,6/10/2023,"This airport is a mess, it is under construction on the outside of terminals. It is very difficult to understand how this airport works and no one seems to know. Very disorganized outside. You have to buy a taxi ticket on arrivals to go to the city. Inside it is clean but lacks better signaling.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,airport,E Malton,6/30/2024,"Great airport, but it is huge and can take up to 25 minutes to get from gate to gate if in transit. Good variety of shops and restaurants, lots of toilets which are always clean. It's a shame there's no areas to relax apart from at gates. Singapore, Doha, KL etc all have sofa areas and big TV's to watch, which is great when you have a long lay over. I always thought there were smoking rooms here, but weren't. Not an issue if you have a lay over of more than 5hrs as you can go through immigration and leave the airport. I did, however, find cigarette butts behind floor standing AC units on two occasions at un-manned gates, where passengers and probably staff hide and have a quick smoke. I even smelt cigarette smoke at one point, so people obviously are smoking in the terminals. Some staff seemed quite unhelpful and stand-offish though when I asked about a few things, but mainly young ones who were more interested in what was on their mobile phones.",POSITIVE,Negative
Bournemouth,airport,S Pinchbeck,9/29/2024,"I would like to say a huge thank to Yasmin who went to great lengths to find us a new flight the same day but from Bristol airport. flight missed (just). Start of holiday delayed by 12 hours only, her professional and helpful support was greatly appreciated! Thank you again.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Buenos Aires Aeroparque,airport,Rich Jenkins,2/2/2020,"Lines everywhere. LATAM has e-checkin but functionally everything is manual. They seem to do their best with a lousy system. The lines seemed to be a function of families having major malfunctions. My check-in took no time at all. It was a long walk to the actual gates. Security was not bad. Many places to eat-local, Starbucks, KFC. They don't seem to use jetways even though they were present and I was on an early morning mainline flight. Arrival was no better-cattle car bus from the plane, long wait for luggage and lines everywhere. The taxi to the center is just a little more than the Liendo shuttle.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Buffalo,airport,Meghan Kowalik,11/27/2019,"Well I went to pick up my Uncle because he is flying in for Thanksgiving. He was waiting at pillar 7. The person in front of me cut me off, and the person behind me pulled up so tight to me that I couldn’t back up to get out and the parking person or security person who directs you out of the pickup area came over and was absolutely atrocious. Swearing at me repeatedly. I will never fly out of this airport again and my family will never arrive by this airport again.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bradley,airport,Maria Stolarz,2/20/2019,"Small airport, very friendly staff, not too many food choices but the best for long layovers if you need a place for sleep, plenty of big chairs/couches, comfortable and with outlets for charging electronics.",POSITIVE,Negative
Amarillo,airport,Andrew Levy,1/7/2005,AMA has 2 passenger concourses but nearly all passengers must use the north concourse (serving the 30-series gates) serving American Eagle Continental Express and Southwest. The northwest concourse (serving the 20-series gates) is largely unused. As a result security screening at the north concourse is prone to long back-ups. One thought is for the airport to modify some leases and reassign tenants in order to ensure that the entire terminal is more uniformly utilized which would reduce terminal congestion.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bangor,airport,Vitaliia Tomakhiv,7/27/2023,"Always loved this airport, but, unfortunately, not this time. I am flying frequently from 2017 and I am aware of what can be brought in carry-on baggage and in what sizes. Officers at the bag control opened my bag and threw out all the bottles (each of which were exactly 100 ml). When I told “But it is 100 ml, it is allowed”, they answered “We allow under 100 ml”. I have never heard this before during 7 years of traveling. I have been traveling through all the world and it always have been 100 ml limit for liquid item in carry-on. I went to website of the airlines, and the airport and each sections clearly states “items do not have to EXCEED 100 ml” or “liquid cannot be larger than 100 ml”. I brought these items from another country and that supposed to be gifts for my friends. It is not something I can buy in the US. No gifts, no mood. Thank you Bangor airport. Firstly, I suggest to know the rules and educate yourself prior to violating passengers’ rights",NEGATIVE,Positive
Baltimore Washington,airport,M Walker,1/3/2024,"My adult daughter had just returned from her connection in Las Vegas to Baltimore Airport in route to her final home destination in Maryland. My daughter had difficulty locating her car and had gotten on the wrong airport bus. Now normally this is frustrating for anyone, but my daughter is autistic so trying to problem solve while in a heightened emotional state is a big struggle for her. Morgan is higher functioning and prides herself on how independent she is, but after a night of flying across country and running to connection flights, she was feeling defeated and concerned about finding her vehicle as the sun was going down. A bus driver named Chris on bus 407 was her guardian angel. He went out of his way to get her to the correct bus before it got dark when the main office confirmed they were too swamped to assist. He even had to deal with an angry traveler yelling at him for taking the extra time of getting Morgan to the correct bus connection although Morgan said he was very efficient and quickly navigated her to the correct destination. Thank you Chris, your kindness is noticed and the world is a better place because of people like you!",POSITIVE,Neutral
Bacolod–Silay,airport,13 reviewsMichael Mejia,6/22/2017,"Bacolod is a small regional airport in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines, which is a short 50 minute flight from MNL. Arrival is short and painless and even if I didn't check any luggage for this particular flight, baggage was out in the conveyor even after my disembarkation through a rather short airbridge. Departure was also pretty fast and straightforward. The waiting area, however, was crowded, hot and dirty. Very few options outside of the very basic business class lounge to sit, eat or have a drink.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Brussels Charleroi,airport,M Kouzi,5/11/2024,"Extremely poor quality of services, if non existent at all. My family and I had to wait at the luggage belt for more than an hour after arrival from EU. There was no assistant or supervisor around. I have been flying from/to Brussels Charleroi airport for years and it is becoming worse and worse. The premises are dirty, the toilets are filthy, with a few of them not flushing. What is audacious is the fact that one has to pay 1 EUR to be able to use them. In addition, there are no trolleys (there have never been) to help travellers carry their heavy and voluminous luggage to the parking. Overall, the worst airport. What a waste of energy and time.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,T Butz,4/2/2022,"Could not be worse run. The absolute model of inefficiency. The say allow 3 hours to check in, and they mean it. Line 1 - cue to enter, docs checked. Line 2 covid test verification Line 3 bag tags docs checked. Line 4 Aruba customs docs checked. Line 5 go through screening docs checked, Line 6 reclaim bags, Line 7 check bags again docs checked, Line 8 US customs docs checked, Line 9 go through screening again - I’m not kidding you have to have your carryon and yourself screened twice. You have to drop off, reclaim and drop off your bag again. My passport and boarding pass was checked no less than 5 times. I had to answer the screening questions 3 times. I booked a repeat visit and have now canceled it. The only reason for 2 stars not one is that there is a nice wine bar but chances are you won’t get to enjoy it as you waste your life away in hours upon hours of senseless lines. The airport process is an astonishing failure in customer service.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Brussels Zaventem,airport,Elvira Starrett,8/28/2024,"This was the worst arrival experience we have had in many years of world travel. It took literally two hours standing in line waiting to be served at passport control until we exited the airport. There were only 3 booths open for the huge number of incoming passengers using the any passport line. There was no area to sit nor any bathroom facilities nearby. It was horrendous and despite wanting to visit family here in future, there is absolutely no way would fly in here again.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bremen,airport,L Addis,2/10/2009,I thought this airport was lovely. Outside are the cobbled roads and tram link into center. In the main airport terminal the facilities are excellent. They have a truly amazing viewing deck with information about the space programme and aircraft using the airport. Security was quick efficient and friendly and boarding immediate to the aircraft. I feel Bremen airport gives passengers the proper respect they deserve even when travelling a budget airline.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Bozeman Yellowstone,airport,1 reviewsE Wittmann,9/8/2015,"Bozeman Yellowstone Airport is a rather small airport, but it's cabin-like design make it unique and special. The concourse is easy to maneuver and the directional signs are very helpful and easy to read. Security is usually a breeze on days with less travel. Bozeman does have TSA PreCheck. The seating areas are nice with stations for charging, Internet Access is also free, but it may not work on some devices. The terminal is spotless, and there are many little shops to have a coffee in as well as a Yellowstone Association store which offers in-depth information about visiting Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and the surrounding areas.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Baku,airport,1 reviewsC Anderson,1/29/2019,"Very new, modern looking airport. Easy check in process, short lines. Affordable luggage wrapping process. Departing lounge spacious, easy to use. Definitely security process can be improved - only 1 or 2 lanes available.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Baghdad,airport,D Stanley,1/18/2018,"Baghdad airport is OK. It works without too much hassle. It is a reasonably modern building. There are 3 linked terminals which you can easily walk between both airside and landside. There is a restaurant landside and small cafes both sides. Capacity is limited airside though. Usual facilities landside - mobile phone companies, ATM's, exchange etc. If you have a long transit, it is better to stay landside and visit the restaurant. There are moderate queues for security and immigration can be a bit slow. If you are not on Iraqi Airways, there may not be any business lounge available (certainly not for Turkish anyway).",NEUTRAL,Positive
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Geoff Painter,9/30/2024,"After over 50 years of air travel, and twenty transatlantic return flights, I experienced the worst check in and airport experience at Berlin Brandenburg in September 2024. My wife and I completed the online check in but that proved to be of little help as it provided us with no means of obtaining the necessary Baggage tags for us to use the bag drop procedure. With minimal staff available, and a long line of people requiring help in fully checking in, we lined up for over an hour before we were able to check our bags. We then lined up for 45 minutes I'm order to go through security. The treatment we received going through security was appalling. My wife and I are not fluent German speakers and when we did not immediately fully understand the instructions, they were simply repeated louder and in a very exasperated tone. We were then thoroughly frisked iand required to take up pistures difficult for those in their seventies. It felt as though we were being punished and the hostility was palpable. Throughout Berlin Brandenburg the lack of Lufthansa staff to respond to inquiries was a problem and we were unable to get necessary information about our connecting Lufthansa flight. The signage in the airport is very poor especially for those arriving at the Flughafen Berlin railway station and there were no staff around to help people. I'm future we will avoid Berlin Brandenburg and use a different airline than Lufthansa.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Blackpool,airport,Paul Cox,10/13/2014,Flew to Dublin yesterday (8th October) after catching train from Preston where I had been working for a few days to Squires Gate which is about a 10 minute walk. £10 ADF was a bit of a disappointment but check-in and security a breeze. Staff friendly and efficient. Depatures lounge was a bit old-fashioned (not necessarily a bad thing quite nostalgic really) but was very clean and the cafe was good. Aer Lingus as always a joy to travel with.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Bucharest Otopeni,airport,Joe Ghinet,6/22/2024,"When standards are low you don't know any better. No responsibility, no accountability no vision, no desire to change for better. Change for worse is easy, you don't do anything. All standards are improving in the industry but here is only complacency, and ignorance. Staff is disgruntled, aware that nothing works therefore no respect for their job. Processes that should work smoothly are just road blocks such as recovering luggage once flight was postponed. Airport in huge disrepair, and miserable as if you were waiting in a bus station close to a garbage dump. Business lounge Dacia, another bad experience, smoker area inside the lounge but they have air where the lounge doesn't have air conditioning. The attendant from the lounge entrance made a joke saying that nobody complains about it, and by the way no worries she had a fan to ease up on the challenge. It seems that my country will be forever the bus station near a mountain of garbage. I personally think it is a shame to claim that we are part of Europe.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Boston Logan,airport,Candy Fowler,10/1/2023,"We’ve traveled the world and last night we were coming from Morocco and had a 12 hour layover. The Immigration and TSA lines were the worst. We in line for hours waiting. Someone had vomited 3 times in the line and no one cleaned it up…disgusting! Agents were not friendly and were so slow. Once we left that area to pick our bags for a transfer for our next flight, that’s when we really hit hell. Long, long, ridiculous walks, no directions, no signs, no staff to assist. Never did find anyone at the Delta bag drop so once we entered Terminal A, the place was empty and cold plus only a few seats and we were stuck overnight with our luggage. Where are passengers suppose to wait? Airport hotel was way overpriced so we were forced to sleep on cold, dirty floor with obnoxious music playing. We’ve never, ever been to such a terrible airport. I feel really bad for visitors to the USA to have this as they’re welcome. Boston has plenty of money. Absolutely the worst airport experience ever. I will never travel thru this airport.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,L Praca,12/6/2016,"As I live in Belo Horizonte, this is the most used airport by me. Before the renovation, this airport was very bad, but now, after the renovation, it looks great, it is clean, the queue time is good, there are many options for shopping and eating and the airport is spacious. The only problem is that it is far from Belo Horizonte city centre.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Berlin Tegel,airport,Hoi Wong,12/7/2019,"Me and my family just arrived today and had the worst experience ever in the Berlin Tegel airport. First of all, the queue of immigration was terribly long and we waited for an hour and a half just to go through immigration. Once we got through the immigration me and my brother got our baggage but my mum’s baggage went missing, so we waited till there was no baggage on the belt anymore. I called the “missing or damaged baggage” but no one picked up. Then I saw staff with a bright green vest so I went to her for help. But the answer she gave me was: missing baggage is not my area, don’t ask me is not my business, then she walked away quickly. I was standing there feeling helpless then I saw the sign of baggage service, so me and my family went there for help. The staff there asked me to fill in a form and wait till they have any news. We are really worried so I ask her when exactly can we get back our baggage, she replied she didn’t know. We felt the answer she gave was really unhelpful so we went to the customer service counter, I told the guy at the desk that my mum has health issues and all of her medicine is in the baggage, then he replied that’s not his problem because my mum shouldn’t have put the medicine in that bag in the first place. He was really rude and judgemental since the reason my mum didn’t take the medicine out of the bag is that the cabin bag was supposed to be taken onboard by herself but the easyJet staff told her that the plane has not got enough space so they had to check in her cabin bag. My mum has all of her heart medicine, sleeping pills and antidepressant in her baggage. Now my mum might have to fly back to the UK since she has been in serious health condition for over 10 years.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Amritsar,airport,Julie Shah,1/26/2019,Absolutely barbaric officials! Me and my friend had 2 days in Amritsar visiting the sites and were overwhelmed by the friendliness of the local people. That was until it was time to leave and the overall experience of the airport. Who on earth do these people think they are and how they are allowed to treat people the way they do. They are a disgrace to humanity and need to be brought into check. Not one nice official at this airport.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Claire Baksa,12/13/2016,"This airport has the most ill mannered Customs Staff we have ever had the misfortune to encounter, border control staff represent their country and the visitors they meet are paying their salaries. We queued for over two and a half hours in the arrivals hall area. There were 3 immigration officers on duty the rest of the booths were empty, please review staffing levels. The officer who processed our forms was not friendly but that was acceptable he wasn't rude. Next were the female customs staff, we have never encountered anyone so openly hostile, rude, ill mannered officers at any airport and we are frequent travellers. One officer was marching up and down the line being openly aggressive, while the other one who checked your documents did not speak but pointed and clicked her fingers to communicate with you without eye contact. Meanwhile the redcaps were walking by with passengers and were exempt from this why? We will avoid this airport in the future this is not the face Barbados wants to present to the world, please re train or replace these individuals, meanwhile remind them that we (the visitors) are paying their salaries and treat the people they serve with some respect or at least basic manners.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Broome,airport,Joshua Smith,10/11/2005,Nice little airport. Size is adequate for the small number of flights a day. Departures and arrivals are separate buildings so it is quick to check-in and collect baggage. Departure hall is basically a pergola with a shop and a bar but it's fine. On arrival you get free trolleys which is a bonus.,POSITIVE,Negative
Belfast,airport,Margaret Kyle,6/16/2022,"In general the airport is tired and shabby and in urgent need of a total upgrade but I was really shocked at the poor standard of cleanliness at this airport. The ladies toilets throughout were awful. Granted we were flying out at a busy time, but arrived back at a quieter time in an evening. Many toilets were blocked, dirty and smelly!! No evidence of cleaning staff around, which is evident at most other airports. What a welcome to visitors from other countries!",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Burnie Wynyard,airport,G Wilson,3/14/2008,Small NW Tasmanian airport with flights to Melbourne & Tasmanian destinations. Neat & tidy with easy check-in & baggage collection. Small cafe/shop & enough seating for size of aircraft using airport. Not a bad little airport,POSITIVE,Neutral

Borg El Arab,airport,Mohamed Abdelnaser,1/2/2018,Horrible restaurants and food! Duty free was closed for no reason!

Boa Vista,airport,1 reviewsDaryn Johnson,6/18/2015,"I personally really like this airport. It's small but does everything it needs to. It looks more like a sand castle than an airport but every time I've used it it's been easy to check in. Unfortunately there is no smoking area anywhere in the airport and considering a fair portion is non smoking I find that a bit strange. Also, once I was delayed and as there are no tannoy announcements you are left wondering about that status of your flight which if you've travelled TACV can be understood. However, if you're a resident of Cape Verde you do get used to the ""no stress"" mentality even if it can be frustrating sometimes. There's a bar either side of check in/customs and they serve snacks. There's also a small duty free shop but most airline's stock would be more comprehensive.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Agadir,airport,H Chown,10/14/2011,"Arrived in the middle of a hot summer's day with a temperature over 40 degrees. There is no air-conditioning in the airport but that isn't necessary due to the design of the terminal which keeps it airy and cool. The border staff looked like they had been asleep for five hours and were surprised by our arrival. Unfortunately there were lots of people outside fighting for the right to carry our bags 20 metres to the taxi. It's a bit of an annoyance but just say ""NON"" very assertively. All signs in French and Arabic announcements too.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bahrain,airport,Tony Williams,6/3/2024,"I enjoyed 2 lengthy stop overs here on a recent flight to BKK in Biz class with Gulf Air. The airport is amazing, clean, and transit was smooth. The lounge was fantastic and food and drinks were excellent. Staff throughout the airport were amenable and friendly. Overall it is a much less stress free and agreeable experience in comparison to transit through Doha or Dubai.",POSITIVE,Negative
Belfast City,airport,8 reviewsAndy Magowan,4/9/2023,"The airport management just can't leave well enough alone. They have changed the layout of the roads in the airport to accommodate their £3 parking charge to drop off/pick up passengers, the new system is quite confusing for anyone not familiar with it and £3 to drop off/pick up is just pure greed. Car parking was ok for a change, the anpr camera actually worked this time and issued me with a ticket then opened up. Check in was simple enough but as before there is a distinct lack of seating in departures. The vast bulk of seating is swallowed up by overpriced eateries. I didn't see any mobile charging ports etc although I believe there are some in the private lounge that will cost you around £30 to enter. So, in summary, BHD management have decided to stick the boot in during the cost of living crisis.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Alicante,airport,Vera McMullan,8/5/2022,"I want to commend staff at Alicante airport on what was my first airport visit post covid. Arriving and departing was prompt and hassle free.

Also the girl at the EasyJet gate took my postcards which I had forgotten to post ,and promised to post them for me. They all arrived eventually, so thank you!",POSITIVE,Neutral
Beirut,airport,B Alsabawi,10/9/2021,"Worst airport I’ve ever been to. It was my first and hopefully last time in Lebanon. I was just passing through, in transit from Cairo to Copenhagen and I’ve never been treated this badly at an airport before. I was singled out and stopped for hours after leaving the airplane and treated like a suspect for no apparent reason. After hours of questioning they finally let me go with the explanation that it’s normal procedure for anyone travelling to Europe! Which is a lie as I saw others pass through with no interrogation, and I’ve traveled back and forth to Europe from many other destinations without any trouble before and especially not when in transit. After they let me go I had to show my passport to every staff member that I passed through and they were all rude and unprofessional. The airport was too small and lacked many facilities, seating area was too crowded. The wifi was almost non existent and their coffee prices and food was too expensive and tasteless! I was followed by their duty free staff members around the airport! I haven’t seen Lebanon but my first impression of the country at their airport left a bad impression which will make me think twice before ever setting foot in their country.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Beijing Daxing,airport,Andy Wilson,6/9/2023,"Big, nice and clean airport. But that’s all. The airport (international departure) is way too big, the airport is very empty. Check-in is very frustrating. Travelled with Qatar Airways and always have had pleasant experiences with them. Not at Daxing airport. 2kg overweight for 2 person was an issue. Needed to re-arrange. After that the check-in lady wanted to weigh the cabin luggage. That was slightly overweight as well. But she wanted to charge 40USD/kg. Although it is the airlines right, never had this experience before with Qatar Airways. She didn’t want to issue the boarding pass until we cleared some stuff. After some negotiations we said we will clear at the gate. This frustrated the journey. At the end they did not check anything at the gate. The queue at the check-in counter was very long. After queuing for a while we realised a separate queue for online-check-in. Time wasted. The signs were not clear and the personnel was not pro-active to inform people. You also need to do a health declaration (arrival and departure). But the machine at the airport is a joke and doesn’t work most of the time. The security check checks every inch of your body, never had this experience as well. They have to take a photo of you prior you clear immigration, at the immigration and when going through security. Every baggage you have they need to take a photo of you and the baggage. For what?! Shops were closes in the evening (after 10pm) and hardly any food courts or restaurants. Disappointing. The connection to the airport is not so convenient: high speed trains every hour or so from Beijing West Railway Station, but the tickets need to be bought in advance. Or metro, but if you are coming from downtown, you need to change metro couple of times. Taxi would be an alternative. Overall, I would prefer Beijing Capital International Airport.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bergen,airport,C Huang,8/4/2019,"Terrible service, security staff totally not efficient. I bought some stuff and had to do some tax refund, the tax forms said that I had to show the purchased items when requesting the refund. The problem was that the refund point was after security control so I could not go in with my luggage. I asked the security how to deal with that and they said send the lugagge and go in with your stuff. So I did that, but I was stopped because I was carrying a tube with cod roe which I had to throw even though I discussed with security that I did what I was told by his colleague. Had to give up the stuff I purchased legally because the staff did not tell me how to proceed correctly. First of all, tax refund point should be before security check, second thing is that the tax refund forms say that I had to show the items, but the security guys did not tell me that, because of their ineficiency I had to throw my purchase for nothing. I even asked for complaint forms and they did not give me that, that's why I am writting this review, to express my totally disappointment against a totally unacceptable way of doing things, i understand is their duty to comply with security protocol, but don't tell me to bring the stuff inside if you are not 100% sure that it will go in. First time I am so disgusted in an airport, felt I threw my money for nothing, thanks God the product was not an expensive one, but besides that their attitude was totally not professional.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Antwerp Deurne,airport,S Smith,12/20/2009,Fantastic airport. I go in and out at least once a month. Yesterday I timed my arrival and from walking off the plane to being outside at a taxi was 43 seconds!!! 15 minute check in for departures.,POSITIVE,Neutral

Buenos Aires,airport,S Galerte,3/13/2023,"I flew into EZE and out of EZE a week later, international flights for both. The arrivals process took about an hour and the lines moved slowly, but the staff was proactive in getting us through the process as quickly as possible, including by waving us over to the Argentine Citizen lanes once all the citizens were processed. Departure, however, was a considerably worse experience. The signs on the road into the airport clearly state that all international departures check in at Terminal A, so that's where my taxi driver took me. However, it turns out that Delta and Aerolineas Argentinas international departures check in at Terminal C, so I had to make the 5 minute walk over there in the hot sun (it was in the 90s Fahrenheit that day). After arriving at Terminal C I changed into long sleeved clothing because I was flying somewhere much colder; however, the Air Conditioning in the buildings was poor, so I sweated through my clothing very quickly just while waiting to check my bag. Finally, it seems that EZE has a rule that nobody can bring liquids over 100 mL onto a plane going to the United States. This rule seems was enforced on all flights to the US. But I have not seen that rule enforced on flights to the US from Europe or Asia, so it seems like it's airport (or at least Argentina) specific. It was incredibly annoying because it meant that I couldn't take any water with me on the plane. Unfortunately, if you're visiting Buenos Aires from very far away you'll likely have no choice but to use EZE. But be prepared for confusing directions, poor climate control, and stricter security protocols then you'll see elsewhere.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,1 reviewsSilviu Ursu,6/19/2024,"Berlin Brandenburg (BER) is not probably, is definitely the worst airport I have ever been in more than 20 years of flying all over the world.

As many times the case, things are not always as they are marketed/sold, but here the gap is truly wide. In my ranking of over 200 airports I’ve been at, BER “excels” as the international airport with the most miserable/rude staff I have ever had to deal with, a definite 0/10. Probably never flying from here again.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Ballina Byron,airport,G Bray,6/6/2015,This is a small domestic airport that has outgrown it's small terminal by a long way. It strains to handle anything more than two aircraft at a time. When I arrived there were 3 planes trying to be turned around in the same hour. Arriving passengers packed out the baggage hall with their friends and relatives while departing passengers filled up every other space in the airport. The queue through security went out the terminal door resulting in some passengers mistaking this as a line for check in and missing the check in cut off time limit but thankfully airport staff allowed them to still check in with the chaos. Beyond the single security point it was standing room only. With only two gates side by side more confusion occurred at people lined up for the wrong aircraft because of snaking lines in the small space. A new terminal which is planned but not going to be built for some time it can not come quick enough.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,T Dokland,9/13/2013,Recent Improvements have made this small airport quite reasonable. There are a few dining and shopping options and the area is fairly large and pleasant. They still play terrible elevator music. Free internet is a bonus. The airport is conveniently located to the city but there is no public transportation available. Parking is $12/day bit it is often difficult to find a spot.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Broome,airport,Joshua Smith,10/11/2005,Nice little airport. Size is adequate for the small number of flights a day.

On arrival you get free trolleys which is a bonus.,POSITIVE,Neutral

Algiers,airport,9 reviewsAndre Bouzid,10/28/2015,"Arrival from London was fine but the immigration hall was packed and it took a bit of time to get through. Baggage claim is always a nightmare at Houari Boumidienne airport (Algiers) because everyone has so many huge bags and the system isn't very efficient. Connections to the city are ok but we got a taxi. On the way back, check in had a very long line. But since we had online check-in, they allowed to go into Club Europe's queue though the way the agents work so lethargically, it wasn't much quicker. Immigration was smoother than on arrival. Security was separated by gender which annoyed some less conservative Algerians. I have to say we got the timing spot on as we were able to buy some Algerian wine and after a few minutes, we were boarding. But then, there is more security after the boarding gate which slows everything down as the X-ray kept breaking. What I personally don't like about Algiers airport is that there is so much ""security"" when in fact, the officers behind the screen are just chatting and laughing, barely looking at the screen. Overall, it is an ordinary airport with nothing particularly good but not bad either.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Bratislava,airport,P,8/6/2021,"I don't know who decided to add a worker before the controls who is there to be there controlling if the passengers have all the required documents. I flew to Italy with my son. Covid pass, boarding pass, passports ok, except the mandatory online form for the Italian authorities. I almost missed my flight, my son had a panic because the woman from security thought that my fpdl.eu form was not completely ok. I did it again in front of her but she rejected the new one. Finally she called somebody who told her to let us go. Very bad experience, conflict, stress and frustration and running crazily to catch the plane. After that stopping to show the boarding pass again and again in a really pathetic ritual with pathetic security control staff. I will avoid this airport in the future.",NEGATIVE,Positive

What a joke, 3 international flights at the same time arriving on a Saturday morning shouldn,t have been a problem but this is Adelaide Airport. Definitely could not deal with the amount of passengers coming into the customs and baggage area. Rude customs officers who looked so aggresive you dare not look at them. Some employee walking around with a stick in the baggage area saying queue here but kept changing her mind where she actually wanted people to queue to exit the area. That was quite amusing. Just chaos from start to finish and the comments that were coming from other passengers ranged from disbelief to embarrassing to hilarious. Worst international airport  I have gone through and such a negative first impression of Adelaide.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

There should have been some facilities that make the airport more interesting for example a reading corner, some cool spots for taking a picture, fun games, and more cafes or restaurants. The good thing is it's easy to follow the signs or directions and you don't have to walk that far to reach the gate, transit area, departure or arrival hall. So, it would be a great idea to make this airport bigger and larger with more facilities.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Aalborg,airport,Paul Van Alsten,5/22/2011,AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.,POSITIVE,Negative

Amsterdam Schiphol,airport,Kouros Garno,1/4/2025,"In my experience Schiphol is hands-down one of the worst airports; consistently, year after year. I suggest to those who manage the airport to pay a visit to Singapore, Doha, Abu Dhabi, Athens, Madrid in order to educate themselves about how great airports are being run. In Schiphol it has become normal for passengers to have to wait for over an hour to collect their luggage, luggage is often damaged by the handlers in that airport, security screening is horrendous, the toilets are dirty, the staff are obnoxious and rude. Long time ago it used to be a nice experience to travel through Schiphol, for quite some time not any more.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",POSITIVE,Negative

Billund,airport,Christian Britten,9/17/2009,Billund is an excellent airport with good facilities practical layout and friendly and efficient staff.

I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away.

There is a bar and small tax free shop where you can get the usual liquor and spirits. Just 1 or 2 toilets which are rather small, but again for the amount of people using it, I do not consider it a problem. Small area to play for kids, and you just walk about 200 meters to the airplane which will be parked directly in front of the departure hall. Very convenient, quick security check and baggage drop off and it's easily accessible with both car and public transport (bus), which will depart twice every hour and will take you about 30 minutes to downtown. Wi-Fi does not work all the time but when you restart it, it will be working again.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Blantyre,airport,Wilbert Wolfs,2/2/2009,Arriving at Blantyre's Chileka airport is a colonial experience. Arriving from Johannesburg the airplane is taxied in front of the arrival hall. School classes have already been run out to see the big bird landing. The building has a wooden veranda and there is a special area were people are expected to cheer after the president has landed. The first time I arrived at Chileka the luggage was simply dropped on the tarmac. The passengers had to fight to get their possessions. Of course quite some passengers did not find any luggage at all as it had stayed behind in Jo'burg. Immigration is quite impressive with a lot of stamps in passports and on listings. To get out you have to go through a door then you turn sharply turn left and right. Again left until you bump into the departing passengers and their luggage.

Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,R Riley,12/15/2024,"We flew into Atlanta on a Delta flight from Paris with a connection (from Atlanta) to Orlando. Once off the plane it was easy to get to and complete passport control. However, all required interactions/processes beyond passport control were chaotic, loud, noisy, and rude. Specifically, - Part of the CBP process requires international arrival passengers to claim and then recheck luggage (if connecting). We waited at the assigned and posted carousel for over 30 minutes and then heard an unidentified person (employee?) yell out the bags for our flight were coming up two baggage claim carousels at the same time. How are passengers expected to know bags are coming in on the assigned carousel AND another carousel not posted for the flight? - After picking up checked bags, there was no posted guidance as to where to go or what to do. We rounded a turn and three separate airport employees were yelling three different sets of directions. One said to get into a particular line/queue but said nothing about checked luggage drop off. So we got in line. A separate employee came over yelling that our checked bags needed to be dropped across the room...no signage identified this and the only direction was to get in the line...so how would we know? - After sorting out the checked baggage drop, we went to another line for a security checkpoint. At the beginning of the line some unidentifiable airport employee was standing off to the side talking with people and it was not at all obvious she had anything to do with the security screening process. So, we proceeded into the line where other passengers were waiting. The employee then yelled something rude at my wife who was ahead of me. I asked the rude employee what she wanted. She said ""open your passports to the photo page."" So while fumbling with my passport and holding my carry-on, I asked ""why, the line is so backed up it will be 30 minutes until we get into the security checkpoint?"" The obnoxious rude employee then said ""you'll need to step aside"" and continued her side conversation with others. She then blurted out to other passengers ""ya'll can pass him by, I don't know what he be doing."" So the employee wanted people to open the passport but she was not looking at the passports and further did not appear to be in any way part of security, TSA, etc. Her uniform resembled cleaning crew. To make this worse, after opening the passports, the next employee just before the security checkpoint was instructing passengers to put the passports back in the bags with other items to clear security screening. -The security screening process was simple enough but employees were yelling with no clue that multiple people yelling means few instructions are understood and passengers are offended by their interaction. In a nutshell, many of the employees in Atlanta stand around barking instructions that cannot be understood. Many of these people should be replaced with signs like most modern airports have. Once beyond passport control Atlanta seems to have few signs or posted instructions as to what is required when arriving on an international flight with a domestic connection. Other airports around the world are far better at informing passengers and in my experience are less likely to be yelling at people like they are herds of cattle. Many employees at the Atlanta airport are unnecessarily rude if asked any questions or if asked to repeat whatever they are yelling. Avoid Atlanta if possible!",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bacau,airport,A Dron,7/20/2013,Probably the smallest airport I have experienced. On arrival distance between the entry doors from the apron to the immigration desks can not be more than 5 yards. This means that passengers have to queue outside which in inclement weather must be unpleasant. Passport checks were fast however. On departure similarly tiny landside area with minuscule cafe to left of entrance doors. Incredibly cramped check-in/security area to right of doors although check-in agent friendly and helpful. Security checks are very thorough - had to remove belt watch etc and they found small jar of jam I'd absent-mindedly packed in my carry-on bag. Departure lounge was standing room only for a single Boeing 737. Couple of vending machines are the only refreshment sources. Local people told us that a major expansion of the airport is planned but from look of abandoned foundations beside the existing terminal this is unlikely to be completed any time soon. In short staff seem fine but can not recommend because of lack of space and facilities - even allowing for the fact it's a regional airport not a major hub.,NEGATIVE,Positive

On departure to Dar there were several gates and hundreds of people lined up in a corridor of 6-8 feet while other passengers waking up and down the same aisle pushing and shoving as there wasn’t room. Transfer buses were so unorganized with no one giving clear directions and people were pushing and shoving to get to the bus. On our return to Toronto, the security checks were so crowded, it was a shamble, and trays for shoes, purses took forever to come, and when a few trays came everyone tried to grab them creating such chaos. We had to go through security twice and body search!. On our way to gate A16 we had to go through the body scanner. My son was holding his three year old child and the security staff attempted to grab the child so only the father would be scanned. My son put his child down and told the security staff not to touch him yet the staff tried to grab the child and seeing a stranger the child of course started crying. When I told the female staff I would report them she rudely said to me go ahead and refused to give me her name and turned her badge around so I could not see the name.

When I tell you those women spoke so bad to us I was in disbelief! They get away with it because we are on limited time and can’t risk missing our flights. It’s so bad you want to come 8 hours early just so you have a moment to ask to speak to someone higher because it’s so bad they deserve to know the disrespect the travelers that help pay their salaries are just sick of it! I travel too much to be spoken to or watch other people be spoken to like dogs! Never in any airport in this country or outside of this country have I come across the sheer disrespect I have in Atlanta! If it were easier to drive to a whole other state to leave from I would. Who is their boss do they not monitor how their staff in TSA treats people? Does no one get trained in proper customer service?,NEGATIVE,Positive
Beijing Daxing,airport,6 reviewsSun Xiaoou,2/5/2021,"The traffic of Beijing Daxing airport is very convenient. You can get there by high-speed rail. The design of Daxing airport is very grand and novel. There are many self-service check-in machines in Daxing airport. There are many open windows at the manual check-in place, and the queuing time is short. The efficiency of security inspection is high, but there are few open channels, which leads to a long queue time. After passing the security check, there are many restaurants in it, and the price is the same as that in the urban area. The departure and arrival of Daxing airport are mixed. There are many turntables at the baggage claim area, and the waiting time is very short. It's just that the airport guidelines need to be improved. I was a little confused when I went to Daxing airport for the first time. Airport WiFi is fast and supports takeout at the gate.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Berlin Tegel,airport,1 reviewsW Edwards,9/18/2020,"Treat the travellers terribly. Insisted on one bag per person on your journey on the plane. Even when you paid for 2 on your outward journey. They have everyone queuing outside the airport to get in, yet the departures lounge is the size of a parrots cage. They offer very little duty free and have one unit selling hot drinks and food resulting in rip off prices. Overall the staff are bullish and downright rude.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bremen,airport,Jurgen Arnold,10/8/2007,As living in the north of The Netherlands Bremen airport is a good alternative for Amsterdam. Recently flown from the new low cost Ryanair terminal. Its basic clean and blue! There is a multipurpose shop which sells everything from a to z at somewhat inflated prices and small coffee shop. Seating is mostly in plastic chairs which you could find at your local dentist. Reasonable but we had an early flight so it was not so crowded. Would not like to be there when its get full. There are also some paid internet terminals. The airport is well situated from the city center and freeway from the parking garage you are within 3 minutes in the main terminal building. Bremen is still a great small airport but they need to get some other low cost airlines on board besides Ryanair.,NEUTRAL,Negative

I took Air China from Singapore to Beijing Airport for a layover, we were hand carrying our duty-free bought in Singapore for my relatives. When passing customs into domestic flights, we were told Duty-Free were to be put in cargo so we sent it to be put in cargo. Keep in mind we were using a fabric bag so it's not very protective. We put the fragile sticker on the bag and GUESS WHAT? They put 2 heavy hard casesd luggages on top of our bag and they threw our bag onto the belt to bring it to cargo hold. I could feel the thud from the throw as I was in a Window seat above the cargo hold. They even threw our bag in the cargo hold. They threw our bag 2 times so hard I could feel the thud in the cabin. After we got our bag, we found the duty-free leaking. It was a $60 bottle of alcohol for my relatives. Airport was ok just the ground crew.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,David Johnson,10/20/2024,"TSA was grossly understaffed with a single, slow, lethargic employee managing the only security check in station. I watched hundreds of flyers standby and watch their flight times pass by as the line stayed stagnant taking just over two hours to even get to baggage check. From an operational standpoint - Atlanta's airport should be momentarily shut down and reorganized. They need to up their headcount severely and while replacing operational leadership to more experienced individuals who are capable of getting security wait times below 2 hours. Truly an embarrassing organization where critical thinking goes to die. No other business or operation could survive with this leadership and conduct. Extremely horrible experience, please avoid this airport at all cost.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Billund,airport,Christian Britten,9/17/2009,Billund is an excellent airport with good facilities practical layout and friendly and efficient staff. My only gripe is the airport bus which is extortionate (DKK180 to Aarhus) and runs at often perplexing times that seem to have no correlation to when major flights are landing. I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away. As the airport is far from where most foreign travellers want to be (unless they really like Lego) you often have little option but to wait for the bus or pay even more for a taxi.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Bodrum,airport,4 reviewsJamie Green,7/27/2024,"What a lovely little airport, the whole experience seemed organised with little to no queuing areas as passengers seemed to just self manage to the different areas of the airport. From check in to departure the airport was very clean with little wrong on this front. I found myself very impressed with the smiling security team as I went through pre security and main search area as well. Arrivals was good as well with clean arrivals area straight from the plane. I was really impressed with this airport when comparing to some of the UK airports, it has a much higher standard. Wifi runs on a free voucher system which worked a treat, very easy with no need to sign up. Shopping is not great as there is just a duty free shop and F&B is limited and expensive. Overall a very good airport.",POSITIVE,Negative
Adelaide,airport,L Borrill,1/11/2019,"I have never reviewed a place before. But I have never been so let down by a service before either. We arrived and had a rocky landing. No big deal. Went to the bathroom straight after landing and then went to walk out the front. We walked through the electric door that took us to the rest of the airport and my little sister realised she had left her phone in the bathroom. We turned around and the doors had just shut behind us and we couldn’t get back in. We asked she security guy if she could run to the bathroom and he said no. Once you walk past the line you can’t come back. We asked how we could get in and he simply pointed in a direction and ignored us. Everything was closed, it was 11pm. We tried to ask him again how we could get back in and he still flat out ignored us. Another staff member walked past and said dont stand near the door. When we asked him where we could go him simply talked over us and said don’t negotiate. You can’t go in. Go away from the line. My little sister was in tears and she had saved and worked so hard to get her new phone. We called out the passengers coming through and asked them go check the toilets for us. We were so lucky that the passengers coming through were helpful because the staff would not even tell us how we could retrieve it. We weren’t trying to argue, weren’t drunk or loud. We simply wanted help. I understand their security reasons and wanting to keep the place safe. But the rudeness and lack of helpfulness from several staff member was disgusting. Worst help. Worst manners. Worst people.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Made to stand for 1hr and 20 minutes a lot of this time outside, freezing cold. There was absolutely no reason that we could not have waited in relative comfort at the gate. The airport is small but so unorganised. Only 3 flights leaving at the time we departed, they couldn't even look after the customers that were there. I also flew into Bournemouth, arrived at 5pm, the arrivals Hall was absolutely freezing with no facilities and the main departure hall had not one place open to get provisions whilst awaiting collection.

Ajaccio,airport,P Paquet,1/7/2017,"Site of the airport is unique, but it is the only great thing about it. This airport is unfit for modern travelling while not even maxed out in terms of capacity. Parking lot is expensive and frequently full. Roofs and walls start rusting already. Air conditioning is minimal. Bathrooms are just above the level of average in terms of cleanliness. Luggage handling ground staff has managed via unions to apply a 5 Euros fee per kg to any luggage above 23kg, which make it very uneasy when you fly business class after you've left Corsica with an allowance of 30+kg. This is very annoying because this fee is collected by the airline at check-in and not mentioned in your fare rules when you buy a ticket. Controls are done in a corridor between 2 walls. There are no boarding bridges. No buses. Boarding gates are few and room is tight during the busy summer season. Boarding gates are a few hundred meters away from your aircraft, which makes it very unpleasant to walk from the gate to the plane under the rain. Same issue at arrival if it is raining to reach the airport. 3 luggage reclaim belts, which are very tight during the busy summer season.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Austin,airport,1 reviewsM Hayes,8/25/2023,"I have a been a frequent traveler of Austin-Bergstrom Airport (AUS/KAUS) since the airport opened back in 1999. I have seen the airport grow and change over the years. The changes over the years have been for the better! Notable things about Austin-Bergstrom International (AUS): - there are two terminals the (main) Barbara Jordan terminal where all the restaurants, lounges and stores are, and the South Terminal currently Allegiant and Frontier Airlines. - there is a family viewing area outside the airport for watching planes and having a picnic. There are currently 4 lounges (AA, UA, DL and a Chase Sapphire Terrace) - there are many good places to eat including many local restaurants (my favorite are Taco Deli, Salt Lick BBQ, Second Bar + Kitchen, Annie's, and Juiceland. - it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end of the terminal to the other, along the way you will see lots of places to eat, drink and shop. Pros: clean, great dining, bars, and rest areas. The Delta lounge is the nicest lounge in the airport. Cons: restaurants close early, so if you arrive on a late(ish) flight you will not have food options.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Almaty,airport,S Baltanek,12/16/2021,"Almaty airport international departure lounge is only one hall, where everyone on all flights is jammed together. Extremely small space. The cafeteria available there are horrible to put it best, there is a Starbucks with very few tables. The cleanliness is substandard. Try not going to the toilets if you can: it is just a psychologically traumatic experience: the smell is horrible, not clean, often no paper towels available, the soap dispensers are just unpleasant to touch. Business class lounge at Almaty Airport is a huge scam, do not go there. It has very small space, poorly ventilated, all airlines crammed into one room, and the scam is that they charge for everything there, including for water, at overpriced rates. The security procedure is ridiculous. The passport control check passport and checks the face matches passport. The security check is roughly 10 meters after passport control, where there is a separate counter with someone checking passport and asking to show face. Now, the funniest part is that right after the counter, literally after taking 3-5 steps, there is another person who asks to show passport and checking the face again. I am not joking, this is seriously being done by people at the airport, literally three separate passport and face checks within 20 meters.

Cagliari,airport,Tony McLaughlin,6/26/2019,"This is a European regional airport, and a tale of two airports really. The non-Schengen flights come from Gatwick (BA) Stansted and Dublin (Ryanair) as well as a flight from Moscow. When all four arrive at roughly the same time, Passport Control is chaotic. There were two snake queues, those with identity Cards only were ushered into one, and those with Passports ushered into another. A third queue then formed and this is where the chaos began, and people were jumping from queue to queue. The departing situation was a lot better. Quite a busy departures area, but nicely designed. The gates for the non-Schengen destinations are 20 – 23. Passengers can go here straight away and clear Passport Control. Once through Passport Control, Ryanair passengers should head downstairs to gates 22 & 23, while BA passengers should wait in the lounge just through Passport Control. Not sure where the Mosco flight departs from. I doubt if I will be travelling here again anytime soon, but departing from this airport is much better than arriving at it.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

But my problems started when I was waiting for gates to announce. The gates was announced 45min before the flight and to go to the gates I need to pass passport security. And there my fun begin. I was waiting in the line for 20min. And than the security guy who was checking my passport and who barely spoke English told me to move in the side of the line to serve others. He had issue with my passport I have for almost a year and passport I used to arrive in the country. I gave my id to confirm my identity. But instead of letting me through he started to scan each page with UV light and checking each page in the scanning system.

When like 5min left the manager come, check my passport for 1min and let me pass. I was the last one boarding. I wonder what would happen if they would keep me longer without explanation.

Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,10/23/2011,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports. It's easier to use than Rio or Sao Paulo at least until you get to the cramped gate area.,NEUTRAL,Negative

A member of the BMI ground staff called the plane who found the phone and brought it to me. If arriving at Bishkek always make sure you are being collected at the airport by someone you trust and don't rely on taxis at the airport. Check in on the return trip at about 5.30 am was trouble free if a little slow on account of no online check in for my Turkish Airlines flight and painfully sluggish check in and security check staff. Travelled Business Class. Don't expect much from the BC lounge.

I had to wait for a staff, unfortunately, but she was incredibly helpful, calm and smiling. Their security staff may seem a little stiff, this day was not busy, but they still did not have the profits for a smile. However, they must be praised for being very quick to get guests through. This airport had a passenger record a few years ago, with 3 million passengers annually, therefore, they chose to expand the airport. But instead of giving passengers the more space they deserve, they chose instead to expand their very fine lounge, which is never filled, as well as the office for the staff - a disgrace to people who travel a lot. The design of the airport is great even though it is old. as mentioned, the staff are some of the friendliest staff and they are the reason why I love coming here. On a busy day of travel, it is impossible to find a place outside the lounge to sit down.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Buffalo,airport,M Dean,1/10/2023,"In Buffalo Airport, you cannot pay anything with cash.

Accra Kotoka,airport,K Teague,9/21/2018,"Beautiful state of the art equipment but some poor organisation despite lots of friendly staff. Nobody tells you the procedure, join this queue then shuffle along only to be told you should have gone to the luggage weigh-in queue first. Weigh luggage then rejoin back of check in queue. Told to go to security, shuffle along for a bit then someone asks for departure card. Leave security queue, go to desk where you collect and fill departure card then rejoin back of security queue. Suggest check in desk staff give you a departure card so you will know to fill it in before going through security. Takes a while to shuffle through that and go through immigration departure check then security check. All took about one and a half hours. At gate we were divided into groups 1-5. Not enough seats for group 5 although most passengers are in this group. Infrastructure is very impressive and no doubt they will eventually streamline procedures. Sign posting would be a good start. Shopping and dining facilities are mostly not yet open so I cannot comment on this aspect yet. So, first taste of new terminal: not half bad. Clean, spacious, excellent kit, friendly staff but poor procedures.",NEUTRAL,Positive

Not many shopping or eating options, but how much do you really need on a short layover? The staff seemed engaged and friendly.

Adana,airport,William Foran,10/4/2007,Adana is in the southern part of Turkey and so the grounds of the airport are full of palm trees and other desert flora. It is chaotic as the previous reviewer has commented. What was amazing to see was aircraft taxiing in on the same part of the tarmac as passengers walking in from their recently landed flights. I recommend the restaurant on the second level. The food was terrific ( it is frequently so in Turkey) and the view (Including the aforementioned strange combination of people and aircraft) was very entertaining. Most of the flights are domestic/commuter flights and therefore the airport is otherwise very quiet apart from the morning and evening rush hours. Yes one could get a whiff of tobacco smoke or strange odors in the terminal but this is the middle east. One should take these differences between our world and theirs in stride.,POSITIVE,Negative

Barcelona,airport,Emily Curran,7/27/2024,"I took a flight on Air Senegal from Dakar to Barcelona and was meant to transit in Barcelona to Dublin. My bag did not arrive in Barcelona, and due to long immigration lines I missed my flight to Dublin. I rebooked a flight for that evening, and then spent the entire day tracking down each of the four luggage carriers in Barcelona airport; all of them claimed to not work with Air Senegal, and kept sending me back to each other. I went back and forth from Terminal 1 to 2 repeatedly, and when I asked for help at information kiosks the staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful, acting as if it was an inconvenience for them to provide information, which is their job. I was in tears after a few hours of this. Each luggage carrier claimed that they don’t work with Air Senegal so they would not allow me to fill in a declaration form, which is needed for the lost luggage to be entered in the system. I also was unable to claim the insurance on my lost bag that I had prepaid for because they would not allow me to fill the declaration form. The only luggage carrier that was helpful was Avia Partner; there were two staff there who were really lovely and the male staff member even helped me to fill a declaration form manually. Unfortunately a manual form does not enter the loss into any systems, it just documents that I was there. I called Barcelona Airport repeatedly after finally arriving in Dublin and the Barcelona Airport staff refused to help me once again. I still have no idea where my bag is one month later. While this is a shared problem between Air Senegal and Barcelona Airport, I felt that I was not treated respectfully by the majority of staff in the airport and overall it was an awful experience of which I hope does not happen to anyone again. If anyone finds a large red suitcase lying around Barcelona Airport, please let me know. I would seriously consider switching airports if you can on your trip and avoid Barcelona completely. I hope I never have to set foot in that airport again, and I sincerely hope that one day my bag will be found.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Iain Bagwell,8/29/2015,"Overall I like BHM. It's small, staff (at least at Delta check in and gate) are super friendly. The amenities are good for a small regional airport. Bags are usually quick to retrieve. My one gripe is parking. The parking deck is always almost very nearly completely full, so finding a space can often take as long as the short flight to connect in ATL. The one other thing that annoys me every time I do find a space is total lack of smart carts in the parking lots. Hey listen up Airport managers. This is an airport and customers travel with baggage. Don't you think it would be a great idea to facilitate this process of getting bags to terminals by offering a cart service in the parking lots?",NEUTRAL,Negative
Berlin Tegel,airport,Tim Leborgne,2/24/2020,I believe Tegel is one of the worst airports I have visited in Europe.

Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,10/23/2011,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports. It's easier to use than Rio or Sao Paulo at least until you get to the cramped gate area.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,S James,3/18/2018,"The arrival process at this airport post passport control is truly, truly awful. I have never encountered such rude, and on one occasion aggressive customs staff - ever. There is no organisation, reason or process as to why people are forced to queue for lengthy periods of time whilst others simply glide through. On one section of the compulsory entry form I was shouted at for not completing the section on how many children were accompanying me. When I said I had none, and that if this was the case the form said to pass on to the next section the customs lady shouted at me and told me to complete it anyway.

Billund,airport,M Cooper,2/19/2020,"Kind, friendly staff! I was due to travel back to Frankfurt on 9th February when Storm Ciara/Sabine hit Northern and Central Europe. My Lufthansa flight was cancelled before I left for the airport and I was rebooked via text message onto two SAS flights - Billund-Oslo then Oslo-Frankfurt the next day. Unfortunately, after 3/4 hour at the gate on the Monday, my SAS flight was cancelled for technical reasons. There was no SAS rep at the airport so we all had to call their call centre to rebook our flights. I was pretty frustrated but an SAS employee at the call centre was friendly enough when I got through and told me my flight had already been rebooked, though I hadn't had a text message or mail at that time. The Billund airport staff I spoke to couldn't have been friendlier and more helpful. Their hands were tied as they weren't responsible for rebooking our flights but they went out of their way to guide me and fellow passengers. I had had no info from the airline about the chance of booking a hotel/meal vouchers etc. but one kind airport employee took it into his own hands and sorted it all out for me, booking a room and printing a voucher (which they could clearly then redeem from SAS). In short, not much more than an hour after the flight cancellation announcement, I was in an airport hotel room and had time to have dinner and relax before flying the next morning (which all happily worked out). I often fly to and from Billund airport and it's one of my favourites - comfortable, good design, good shops, cafes and restaurants, plenty of seating, perfect view of the runway, etc. Since that day, I've added friendly staff to my list of positives.",POSITIVE,Negative

Brasilia,airport,Rob Brook,8/21/2012,Arrival from Lisbon - long queues for non-Brazilian passport holders at Immigration and then again at Customs after baggage pick-up. Only one person checking everyone from an A340 plane (it took over an hour) so decided not to line up but sit down and wait it out. At least there is a small shop to relieve the tedium. Bring a good book. Plenty of taxis outside to take you into the city. Mine was metered so the fare was as expected. Departure on an internal flight to Sao Paulo. Check in was rapid and lines at security not too bad. But eat outside in the pleasant concourse before you go through security. There is only one small snack stand (that we could find) on airside and the seating area waiting for the transfer bus is small and crowded. No wi-fi either. Essentially many parts of the airport seem not to have expanded with increased traffic. How this airport will cope with the crowds attending World Cup 2014 can only be imagined.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Berlin Schonefeld,airport,G Garbutt,4/6/2020,"Was disappointed by the lack of space and the blandness of the terminal arriving and departing from this airport located in a capital city. I've been in and out of non-primary regional domestic airports which are far more impressive. I would've opted for Berlin Tegel if available. This airport is not as convenient as it is further away from the city centre. No seating in the pre-check-in greeting area. No shelter going to and coming from the car park. Very noticeable when the weather is bad as it was when I was there. There was a convenience style shop which was quite well stocked but nothing exceptional by way of gifts. In the post-check-in area, the hallways are very narrow and tiny and hard seats are either to be found in a long row along the corridor or in tiny boxes around the departure gate. Airport lounge was not worth the bother. Shopkeepers only spoke German even after speaking English to them first. Passport clearance consisted of only one booth for the 100 or so passengers boarding and again a very narrow passage. Baggage collection was quite quick but this is probably because of how tiny the terminal was. The distance from the plane to passport control then baggage collection is so short and badly signposted that you could easily overlook that you are actually in the correct baggage claim area. The airport app was not very appealing and the wifi signal weak.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

If you want to have a meal at the airport, keep in mind that prices are very high than outside of the airport. Shops are not many but you can satisfy your basic needs if you choose.

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,39 reviewsW James,10/12/2019,"Hollywood Burbank Airport is a perfectly splendid airport, and a not-so-perfectly-spendid airport, simultaneously. What do I mean? Well, first, Long Beach is my favorite airport in the Los Angeles area, with Burbank a respectable second, I find them to be more pleasant than (especially) LAX and even Orange County. The feeling of flying into and out of Burbank is one of aviation yesteryear of sorts, think sort of like the show, ""Wings."" Driving onto the airport and following the signage to the terminal and car rental return is simple and straightforward. Drop-off and pick-up areas in the front of the terminal are simply and clearly delineated, though sometimes difficult to access given the constant flow of traffic in that area (which is still nowhere remotely as bad as LAX, but, remember, Burbank's terminal is old). Walking into the airport, you clearly have a feeling of 1930s-era, Art Deco architecture, something really ""Americana"" and unique even as American airports go. Check-in for either American or Southwest is a breeze, no sarcasm, no ""lip service,"" all business, but still pleasant! Seating and flooring pre and post-security is a little aged and worn in some areas and could really stand to be improved, but they're also no worse than much of LAX. Shopping and dining options are very limited even by small airport standards, surprising, considering that we are still in the greater Los Angeles area after all. The staff at the car rental facilities are generally helpful and professional, though actually friendliness is hit-and-miss, I've never met anybody rude there, though. TSA personnel seem to be the most truly hit-and-miss, either ""sugar-coatedly"" friendly and jovial, or aloof and grumpy almost to the point of being rude. To TSA's credit here, though, they are amazingly efficient even by small airport standards, whether you have TSA Pre-Check or not. There has been a proposal by the airport authority to effectively construct a new terminal in the place of the existing terminal, which would be a shame to have materialize with the charming existing terminal could just be renovated and modernized while keeping its rich history in tact.

The most recent experience with them left me in tears. I get to security and the man checking through my liquids etc at the entrance spoke in English and was friendly enough. Then I had to go through the standing scanner machine and a woman held up her hand as if to tell me to wait and said something in German, so I just stood there until she signalled for me to come forward. Then she started talking to me again but didn't signal or move her hand to come forward or anything, so I went ''I'm sorry, I don't understand'' and she abruptly said (in English), ''where are you from'', I told her the UK, then she went, ''you are in Germany, so you ask me, speak English please.'' I just looked at her confused and replied ''Should I come through or?'' then again in English repeated 'You are in Germany, so you ask me please if you want me to speak in english''. I replied, ''okay''.

Never traveling to this airport again.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bergerac,airport,Richard Lindsay,6/24/2013,This airport is small so whilst access is good facilities are very limited. Airside there are only 2-3 vending machine so if you want anything to eat or drink best use the bar Landside. Do not carry tins (eg Duck Confit Pate etc) that are greater than 100g in hand luggage - they will be confiscated at security.,NEUTRAL,Negative

Bangkok Don Muang,airport,Clint Ellis,9/20/2023,How can an airport keep you hostage? 5 hour layover to Japan. No smoking lounges (like Japan) and they won’t let me go outside? I have a boarding pass. I have a passport. What’s the big deal if I go through security again?,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Stephen Cooper,9/13/2024,"We have used the new BER airport a couple of times and overall experience is sub-par for a new airport. The airport feels cramped with limited processing facilities that are not fully functional (manned) that results in some minor congestion and unnecessary delays. Whilst being new the airport is not particularly pleasing aesthetically compared to other major airports. As a capital airport it lags behind many other airports, Changi, Munich, Hamad etc. Should be much better. The airport is quite well serviced by coach, taxi and rail transport to the city and access for vehicle traffic into and out of the airport is quite well designed and functional.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bagdogra,airport,Amullya Rai,3/13/2021,The worst airport I've ever been to. Small and always crowded. Limited amenities and a hassle to go through the security check. But scratch all that cause that is not the actual reason why this airport sucks the posterior like an industrial grade vacuum pump drawing water in the centre of the Sahara desert during the hottest day of a drought caused by divine retribution. The reason why this airport is totally annoying is because the ground staff have no idea how to provide service. No clue whatsoever. It's as if these airline companies purposefully choose their worst dolts to represent them in the most unprofessional way possible. They think of themselves as some celebrities who are entitled to your subservience since they work at the airport. It's like a really really bad joke. You wonder what is going on in the their minds while the try their utmost to make your life harder in whatever way possible. I despise having to use this airport but I have no choice since it's the closest one from where I live. Travellers flying to this airport won't really smell the proverbial but travellers flying from this airport be ready to get a face full of it.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bujumbura,airport,A Sharma,10/29/2013,The most basic airport I have been to. Having been brought up in Burundi and been travelling there and back to the UK over several years I think this airport has gone downhill. Many years ago this was an exciting airport. People could see you off from the observation balcony but gone are the days! My dad wasn't even allowed into the airport to see me off. Airport staff will make your life hell just to say your last good byes to family. My Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi was slightly delayed coming into the airport due to a power cut! I have never experienced anything like it! My arrival into the airport was just as bad with airport staff wanting to open all bags and wanting bribes in order to keep things. Thank god my family had airport entry passes which meant we weren't left short changed. In all honesty I would still recommend as it's just a crazy yet brilliant experience!,POSITIVE,Neutral
Abuja,airport,Alan Wan,2/28/2012,On arrival as we flew Business Class we were near the front of the line for immigration. Baggage did not take too long to arrive. Finding a taxi was not obvious but a friendly airport employee walked us across the car park to the taxis - make sure you agree a price in advance. When we departed Abuja although it was quiet and there was no one in front it still took an hour to check-in. Bags had to be x-rayed and PAX go through a metal detector bags then manually weighed and manually searched after which we could check- in. Due to a computer crash boarding cards were manually written - however ground staff later gave out printed cards at the gate. The business lounge was rubbish but at least the sofas were comfy. At the gate all passengers and bags were searched again - by very friendly staff.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE,Negative
Baku,airport,S Sher,6/22/2021,"I had a few issues with this airport. The first issue was as soon as I entered the terminal after the initial security check. They had 4 hands-free sanitizer dispensers right on the other side of security and not a single one of them worked. I asked the security guard about it and he just shrugged and said they don't work. Thankfully I carry my own hand sanitizer with me wherever I go so I was able to sanitize my hands. After that I went to check in for my flight. I had extra baggage fees that I needed to pay, which I already anticipated. They have one location that you pay for all excess baggage fees. They were working extremely slowly and they were not able to accept an international VISA, MasterCard, or Discover Card. All of them had travel plans on the cards so it had nothing to do on my side. They only accepted credit cards local to Azerbaijan. For being an international airport, this should be an option to pay with an international credit card. Then, as I looked for more sanitizer stations, they had many posted throughout the airport. I found at least 8 more after I went through security. Not a single on worked. During COVID, this should be one of the priority items to help minimize the spread of COVID at an International airport. They did not have a single working sanitizer dispenser in the entire airport. Then, because of the issue with them taking so long to pay for the extra baggage fees, I needed to quickly get to my departing gate because they didn't open the check-in process until two hours before departure instead of the three hours for an international flight that they are supposed to. I went to the security check I was accustomed to use and I was then told after I got up there that that security checkpoint was not open and I had to enter through the other side of the airport. There were zero signs showing that the security checkpoint was closed. Normally this wouldn't be so big of an issue, but because of the delays with paying for the extra baggage, the plane had already started boarding and I didn't have much time. My family and I had to run to the other side of the airport to go through the other security. This airport is not very large, but it still takes a little time to get from one side to the other, especially when you are already late because of delays that were beyond our control. We were at the airport four hours early and almost missed our flight because of all of these combined issues that were out of our control, the security being shut down without notice, the excessive delays with the baggage, and them opening up check in 2 hours before flight departure instead of 3 that is stated. This was a very frustrating and bad experience at the airport and much of it would have been eliminated if they just had these things in place that are common sense.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Albany,airport,I Abodunrin,8/9/2009,It's a relatively small airport. I agree with the earlier post about it's speediness.

Athens,airport,Mia Nielsen,6/25/2024,"This airport need to up their standards! Even though you check in and print your bag tag you still have to wait in line with everyone else, which kind of defeats the purpose. And the line moves so extremely slow. I’m sure the staff at the check in counters are lovely people but I have never seen anyone work slower. This resulted in a man from Aegean having to shout out for passengers to flights that were on closing because they couldn’t make it through the line on time. Then you finally get to security and here they have staff guiding you to the different security points but they seem to have no sense of which line is actually full - I was directed to the longest line. Overall not a good experience. Arrived to the airport at the estimated time but couldn’t even make it to my gate before they started boarding.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Bergen,airport,Peter Thackray,12/13/2016,"A relatively small but busy airport serving a key city on the coast of Norway. Most flights are domestic within Norway. Domestic Arrivals mix with departures and there are 2 baggage belts on the ground floor behind the check-in desks, no specific separation between general public and flying public. On the ground floor there are 2 convenience shops selling snacks, drinks etc and a small café/bar. The Check-in is predominantly self-service with very few staff evident. Upstairs to Security and Departures. The main domestic departures has a few food outlets, a book shop and a convenience shop, there is a further section for International Travellers with full Duty Free options. Most planes land at a gate with pier so little need to be outside. No announcements or ""Last Calls"" are made so you need to look at one of the many monitors to check your flight status.

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,J Segal,1/30/2008,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,NEUTRAL,Positive

Bristol,airport,G Jones,7/15/2024,The airport is pretty average but the access road (A38) is appalling. It is not much better than a country lane. For the first 2 hours of morning flights there is an average of 35-40 take offs. The airport can handle it but the road cannot. There is a small junction several hundred metres away which is controlled by traffic lights which causes traffic to jam at the entrance. There are no alternative routes.,NEUTRAL,Negative

Agadir Al Massira,airport,J Davidson,3/28/2018,The security checks at this airport in Agadir is over the top. Luggage checked twice and passport control 4 times. Don't they trust each other? One customs officer has to check the work of the other customs officer? And rows and rows of people trying to find the quickest lanes. Completely inefficient process. It took 2 hours to get through to the gate. I have traveled extensively and even India (in lots of chaotic situations) has a much better organisation. I can understand that security is important but this is absurd and a waste of my time.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Aalborg,airport,K Fischer,8/4/2010,Very quick check-in and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH.

Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,A Anderson,5/21/2024,Spent the last two days and one night inside the airport. My husband went to several different bathrooms and he said they all smell like urine. Terrible like the guy mopping is just smearing all around. The women’s bathroom had dirty floors and pieces of trash lying around. Several of the toilets weren’t flushed. Food options are very limited. Bham is a foodie city and we should show that off to the world. Maybe allow local favorites to set up pop ups during the tourist seasons!! I could give you tons of recommendations as to who to invite and share their menus with travelers. Give them a true taste of Birmingham.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Belgrade,airport,Jelena Jovanovic,7/5/2024,"Despite ongoing renovations touted to improve the traveler experience, left me thoroughly disappointed and frustrated during my recent visit.  The airport has been undergoing renovations for years, yet the promised improvements for passengers seem elusive. Instead of seeing progress, parts of the airport already show signs of wear and tear. The infrastructure appears hastily patched up rather than professionally renovated, which is evident in the airport's deteriorating condition. The airport lacks the capability to fuel planes in rainy weather, resulting in extensive delays. This operational deficiency is unacceptable for a modern airport and has a significant impact on travelers' schedules and overall experience. Moreover, rain leaks inside the airport building and further highlights the inadequate maintenance and planning. Some employees were outright rude and displayed a lack of professionalism. One of the most disappointing aspects of my visit was the food offered at the airport. The quality was shockingly poor, the prices were exorbitant considering the dismal quality and service. Additionally, the service at food outlets was slow and inefficient, adding to the overall unpleasant experience. The toilets were dirty and poorly maintained.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Boston Logan,airport,52 reviewsMahmud Noormohamed,1/20/2024,This review is limited to Terminal A. I haven't flown through Terminal A in years but it still remains a very modern airport terminal. It is spacious with plenty of seating and dining options especially at Gates A12-121. There is a rather long underground walkway from these gates to the main terminal A. The walkway is beneath the tarmac and runways. We dined at Legal Seafoods before departure to DFW. Excellent food. The terminal was very busy given the snowstorm and delayed flights. Bathrooms were okay but could have been cleaner. WiFi was very fast and easy to connect too. Kudos to Logan airport snow clearing crews and the crews de-icing planes. Our flight to DFW was delayed but we managed to take off. Throughout the storm planes kept taking off and landing.,NEUTRAL,Negative

Belize,airport,S Barton,3/7/2025,Unwelcoming airport with poor customer services. It was a full flight from Houston and several of the passengers arrived at the boarding gate with the assistance of airport wheelchairs/mobility support. On deplaning in Belize we were held in a long queue for well in excess of an hour during which time there was no support for the passengers with mobility issues who were visibly uncomfortable. Holiday makers choosing Belize amongst the dizzying array of destinations deserve a little more than the curt services given.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Biarritz,airport,Brian Murphy,8/27/2006,Recently flew to and from Roissy CDG to Biarritz International in the Basque country in south west France for the first time. The airport itself is small but there is a good bus service which will take you into the city centre pretty quickly. On arrival on the 13.00 HRS AF 7638 flight from CDG this flight seemed to coincide with a number of other flights from the UK which made the baggage arrivals area chaotic. In addition the toilet facilities landside need some upgrading and definitely could do with the cleaners visiting there on a more frequent basis especially mid-afternoon which seems to be the peak time for the airport. The rubbish bin in the gents toilet was overflowing when I was there which left a poor initial impression! The airport does have an excellent tourism booth with very helpful staff however. In addition from the airport one can get onto the nearby motorway very quickly and the care hire agencies also had very helpful staff at the airport (especially Europcar). On departing Biarritz back to Paris however I discovered that the departures area has only one very small cafe so passengers may not want to enter this area too quickly as the wait could be long and somewhat boring. In summary the airport is convenient but it falls well short of the new fresher and modern design of nearby Pau airport which is excellent.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Broome,airport,Joshua Smith,10/11/2005,Nice little airport. Size is adequate for the small number of flights a day.

The Airport has no possibility to buy and stamps so if you intend to write postcards and buy the stamps at the Airport forget it. The organisation is quite awful. The 3 queue lines are clearly written but besides having a queue for Crew the non-EU isn't really useful as all planes leaves for a Eu destination.

Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Colleen Rotkis,3/6/2022,"Security lines are insane. This is my 3rd experience with it, and I’m starting to piece together the scam. Don’t we pay a surcharge on every ticket purchased for the delightful experience of trusting TSA to keep us safe by making us remove our shoes and other useless acts. They keep the security lines long creating stress and panic so you consider signing up for Clear ($179/year and more privacy invasion with a retina scan and fingerprint capture). So the elite (those willing to fork over the dollars on top of their federal and any other taxes that fund airports and plane ticket fees) cruise on through security while the other ~97% of passengers languish in line and miss their flights. How on earth the warlord of the Birmingham airport allows 70% of TSA staff to service the elites on the TSA Precheck/Clear side vs the 30% (~4 TSA employees) on the side of the regular people, only makes sense in a corrupt government deal. I thought that this would be aggravating for the airlines on the other side of the curtain wondering where the passengers were who paid a pretty penny to fly like cattle while being prodded to pull their masks over their nose the whole time. But a little research revealed that the airlines invest in companies like Clear. Silly me. It’s a circular racquet probably formulated along the lines of the Chicago red light camera and parking meter debacle.

Bandung,airport,F Lakana,9/26/2019,"Bandung Airport is a quaint airport in the middle of the city (used to be the HQ of. Indonesia’s domestic aircraft industry, meanwhile non-existing). It served a number of domestic and international destinations and was a real asset to the city. Then the government decided to build a grand new airport in Majalenka, about 60 or so kilometres north of Bandung, which had to cater for a growing population in the Bandung area and East Jakarta. It was opened pretty much on schedule, which is rare in Indonesia, but in the middle of nowhere; far away from current populations and with poor connections. Since no airlines wanted to move there, the government forced the move of 56 domestic flights from Bandung to the new Kertajati airport. This included the popular Bandung- Bali routes. The result is that it now takes longer to get to the new airport (about 3 hours), than it actually takes to fly to Bali. Some people now prefer to drive all the way to Jakarta, for more choice and cheaper flights. Efforts are made to reinstate some domestic flights in Bandung, but that does not include the Bali route for the time being. Overall, such a shortsighted decision to move all these flights from Bandung to Majalenka.:. So; for as long as Bandung Airport remains an ‘empty shell’ in terms of domestic flights, I will have to give it a low rating.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Banjul,airport,30 reviewsD Sarzen,4/13/2023,"First of all, plan on leaving very early as the road to the airport is always congested, after that being said, be prepared for some hassle. First you need to line up in order to pay a 20 USD or equivalent ""Development tax"", then the airline ""security"" will photograph your passport and all the stamps/visa in it, then you will be allowed to check in. After that, you will need to clear immigration, be prepared to have people jumping the queue in front of you and no one will say anything. Some officers want you to fill the departure form, others will let you go without it. Security line is fast as long as you do not have computers etc... inside the carry on. Do not shop in foreign currency at the duty free or you will be ripped off, if you need to exchange your last dalasis, you will be able to, but they will give you lots of coins, which for me was just fine. Blackouts are common at this airport, just saying. Boarding is chaotic, they do not respect the classes or groups, anything goes. People needing wheelchair will literally be carried by 3-4 men from the tarmac to the plane and be prepared to tip. The only thing that worked fine in here believe it or not was the WiFi, it was free and fast.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bangkok Don Muang,airport,D Barter,6/2/2022,"The domestic terminal is better than the international, seemingly having been refurbished during Covid. Both have adequate food options. Plenty of seating. Clean. Domestic departures. At security beware the overzealous and brusque female personnel with their metal detector wands. A small coin inadvertently left in a pocket will immediately incur their wrath. Perhaps their rigorous practical training could also include occasional use of the words 'please' and 'thank you'. Polite manners to avoid confrontations are as important when dealing with foreigners as they are with the locals. International departures: leave plenty of time for passport control and security which is efficient but there can be long queues.

Antalya,airport,N Carlan,9/5/2024,"Antalya airport is the most expensive airport I have ever been to. The prices are extortionate, for anything from the duty free to the various cafes and fast food restaurants, for the price you expect the food to be at least hot, the food was cold and stale. I just do not understand how they can charge so much for bad quality food. I understand airports are expensive but this was a different level of expensive. The rest of the airport is alright, easy to find where you’re going and helpful staff. You did have to go through double security once at the door and after you check in your luggage, so be mindful to not buy any drinks from downstairs. Also there is no airport WiFi you have to pay. Overall I will not be returning to Antalya because even outside of the airport prices are extortionate and vendors do not know how to trade in their own currency of lira. Everything is in Euros.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Agadir,airport,Kevin Maslin,8/11/2008,No major problems here. Lots of check-in desks open at inbound passport control so we were processed fairly quickly and directed to the transfer coach within 20 mins. Lots of 'porters' in brown uniform with trolleys offered to take our luggage when we disembarked from the coach on the return journey. We could manage ok but I think they were asking for 10 Dirham (about 70p) to take you all the way to check-in which I considered to be fairly reasonable. We were told that we could not spend our left over Dirhams in the departure lounge so we changed them at the bank (not for sterling but to euros!) in the lobby prior to joining the queue for the scanning machine. As there was only one channel in operation it took quite a while to get through and then we discovered that the shops would accept sterling euros or dirhams! Ho-hum. We had taken our own drinks through as we had been told the airport prices were shockingly expensive (even the so-called duty-free!) but we did buy 3 Snickers bars at 4.5 euros! We were not aware that our flight was overdue by half an hour as announcements were largely in French fairly inaudible and the screens were not very informative. Once the gate was open though we were ushered through to the plane quite quickly.,NEUTRAL,Negative

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,11/18/2013,Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal. One walks up a sort of sideways V shaped ramp to get to one's plane (I think they may offer use of umbrellas if it rains).,POSITIVE,Neutral

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,39 reviewsW James,10/12/2019,"Hollywood Burbank Airport is a perfectly splendid airport, and a not-so-perfectly-spendid airport, simultaneously. What do I mean? Well, first, Long Beach is my favorite airport in the Los Angeles area, with Burbank a respectable second, I find them to be more pleasant than (especially) LAX and even Orange County. The feeling of flying into and out of Burbank is one of aviation yesteryear of sorts, think sort of like the show, ""Wings."" Driving onto the airport and following the signage to the terminal and car rental return is simple and straightforward. Drop-off and pick-up areas in the front of the terminal are simply and clearly delineated, though sometimes difficult to access given the constant flow of traffic in that area (which is still nowhere remotely as bad as LAX, but, remember, Burbank's terminal is old). Walking into the airport, you clearly have a feeling of 1930s-era, Art Deco architecture, something really ""Americana"" and unique even as American airports go. Check-in for either American or Southwest is a breeze, no sarcasm, no ""lip service,"" all business, but still pleasant! Seating and flooring pre and post-security is a little aged and worn in some areas and could really stand to be improved, but they're also no worse than much of LAX. Shopping and dining options are very limited even by small airport standards, surprising, considering that we are still in the greater Los Angeles area after all. The staff at the car rental facilities are generally helpful and professional, though actually friendliness is hit-and-miss, I've never met anybody rude there, though. TSA personnel seem to be the most truly hit-and-miss, either ""sugar-coatedly"" friendly and jovial, or aloof and grumpy almost to the point of being rude. To TSA's credit here, though, they are amazingly efficient even by small airport standards, whether you have TSA Pre-Check or not. There has been a proposal by the airport authority to effectively construct a new terminal in the place of the existing terminal, which would be a shame to have materialize with the charming existing terminal could just be renovated and modernized while keeping its rich history in tact. In all, Burbank is a good airport with some notable warts, but positive experiences to be had, hard to rave about, but still easy to like.",POSITIVE,Negative
Bremen,airport,Jurgen Arnold,10/8/2007,As living in the north of The Netherlands Bremen airport is a good alternative for Amsterdam. Recently flown from the new low cost Ryanair terminal. Its basic clean and blue! There is a multipurpose shop which sells everything from a to z at somewhat inflated prices and small coffee shop. Seating is mostly in plastic chairs which you could find at your local dentist. Reasonable but we had an early flight so it was not so crowded. Would not like to be there when its get full. There are also some paid internet terminals. The airport is well situated from the city center and freeway from the parking garage you are within 3 minutes in the main terminal building. Bremen is still a great small airport but they need to get some other low cost airlines on board besides Ryanair.,NEUTRAL,Negative

Smoking is legal and the people that choose to should not be treated as embarrassing or like lepers. Most good International Airports provide a smoking area, so they cater for all differing people. I have to leave outside as late as possible, and cannot use the Food, Beverages, duty free or shopping areas as there is no time.

Abuja,airport,M Parker,3/5/2017,"Abuja airport is closing on 7 March for 6 weeks until 18 April for reconstruction of the runway. The nearest airport to Abuja during this period is Kaduna a 3 hour drive or train ride away so getting to and from the capital of Nigeria is going to be a big hassle until the airport reopens. The only international airline currently planning to fly into Kaduna is Ethiopian - otherwise you will have to fly to Lagos and take a domestic flight to Kaduna. Abuja airport when reopened is not too bad to use (by Nigerian standards). The international terminal is not very busy so getting through is pretty painless. The domestic terminal is in the same location - check in is on one side of the internatonal terminal (for most airlines) and the actual departures area on the other side so you have to come out of the check in area and then walk past international departures and back into the departures area. The actual departures area is up an external metal staircase which is a bit of a schlep. At the top you re-enter the building go through security and are in the departures area. It's quite large and there is air-conditioning but sometimes it gets very crowded if there are lots of delayed flights (which is very common). There are some lounges you can pay to use for about N2,000 ($4) so that is well worth it if you are facing a long delay as you will get a more comfy seat, cleaner toilets, better airconditioning and a cup of tea and a biscuit. There are a couple of cafes in the main area selling mostly Nigerian food and a few shops selling the sort of things you find in any Nigerian market. To board the domestic flights you have to exit the departures area down another external metal staircase and then get in a bus or walk to your plane depending on how far away it is parked. On arrival you actually come into the International departures and arrivals building where but you have to exit to the outside to locate your transport as only passengers are allowed into the building itself. One irritating thing about the airport is the X ray bag check to enter each building so if you are flying domestic you have to go through this twice entering the building and then a 3rd time when you are going into the departures area. International arrivals can be a slow process if two international flights arrive at the same time as there is only one desk for international passport holders and a lengthy two person process where someone from state security first checks your passport and then passes it to the immigration official. Be aware that on exiting the baggage claim area in both domestic and international areas you may be asked to show your baggage claim tags so they can be compared with the tags on your bags. I can't recommend the airport but if you are travelling to Abuja it is your only option (once it reopens). It is also much easier to use than Lagos international terminal if you are arriving in Nigeria for the first time. A new international terminal is under construction and due to open later this year. At this point the current strangely laid out mixture of domestic and international should become the domestic terminal. To get from the airport to Abuja is about a 40 minute drive down a wide multilane highway. It is best to arrange a pick up in advance to avoid ending up in a rather tatty and potentially unsafe normal taxi at the airport. The cost to Abuja should be between N5,000 to N10,000 depending on the state of the taxi.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Aberdeen,airport,Margaret Ferguson,2/23/2023,"Firstly, let me say that the Special Assistance Team at Aberdeen are THE BEST. Helpful, accommodating and friendly, nothing too much trouble. It's the rest of the airport which lets them down! We were on a Tui flight due to fly at 2.50pm The check-in board said check-in opens at 12.20. We joined the queue at 12.15. No sign of any staff at the desks. A person in what may have been Tui colours appeared at one of the desks, shuffled some papers, walked away. Another person in airport livery then approached the desk, looked at the papers, and walked off. The check-in desk actually opened, by ONE of the two staff at a different desk than advertised at 12.30. A minute later, a guy joined at an adjacent desk After check-in, security. The lady on the desk said I'd asked for assistance so should have a wheel chair. I didn't need one for this airport, just help with the steps to the plane. Nope, she said it was the rule, and sent me back to the assistance desk. Assistance guy escorted me back to security and explained that it wasn't quite the rule, Through security, to a very quiet shopping mall. Down the steps to the departure lounge. There is a small lift thing, but I'm scared of it, Would you believe the coffee shop at departures was closed. There is a soft drinks and confectionary machine but no coffee. Hubby then went back up the stairs and eventually found a coffee shop open in the mall, I realise that the airport was not busy, which is odd for a Saturday. But really, to not have an open coffee shop or indeed not to show it closed before the departure lounge, is poor. Maybe we are all expected to pay the exorbitant fee for the Northern Lights lounge. The next problem was indeed the departure. I don't know whose fault this is, whether Tui or airport administration, but it's at least inefficient. The departure board said gate opens 2.15. We could see the plane on its usual stance-It comes from Tenerife, gets cleaned, turns round and goes back I believe. We had been told gate 1. We got there at about 2.20 and were taken to the plane lift when the flight was eventually announced. We waited in the lift at the emergency door, for a good five minutes until the door was opened. By this time it was 2.35. We could see the queue of passengers for the other doors, in the cold wind and gathering clouds. There were babies and toddlers in that queue. As an aside, this stance is one of the farthest away from the terminal. BA flights have covered walkways from the terminal itself. Maybe it's something to do with landing fees, for which I believe Aberdeen is expensive. Eventually we were allowed to board. The plane was absolutely perfectly clean I have to say. Just unfortunate for those poor passengers who had to wait so long in the cold, with young children. All in all a poor airport experience",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Bermuda,airport,T Shuler,7/2/2021,"International Airport? What a joke. Although new, this airport is lacking in accommodations and facilities for travelers. For example, there's only 1 place to get anything to eat or drink in the entire airport. Stand in a Long line to order 2 burgers n fries, chips, and two drinks for $125.00! For that you can enjoy a 3 course meal at 5 star Ascots for two. Or, you can feast on a huge Sunday Brunch at Fourways for $120 for two. I've included photos of the restaurant poster, and then of the Real restaurant. Only 4 items actually offered- none from their poster. There is one shop, which closes at 4pm. There are very few travel supplies typical of any other airport. They claim that the shop is duty free, but liquor prices are higher than in town. Do not expect any common airport facilities other than this. If more than 1 plane arrives or departs at the same time, expect a backup at every stage of your experience. Honestly, I've had better accommodation and service at regional airports handling local traffic and single engine planes.

Anchorage,airport,M McManus,10/16/2011,Went to Anchorage in late 2011. Airport has some restaurants on the security side of the airport but not a good choice and the quality was not too good. The gift shops on the other hand are excellent especially if you are looking for Native American art. Be warned that quite a few souvenirs are like snow shakers with water which will be taken off you by security if you need to pass through them again. Information screens were useful. Plenty of seating and quite a view out of the terminal window.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,A Makki,8/27/2018,"The airport is much better now since the renovation is complete. Plenty of parking when you arrive. There are a range of shops (Patchi chocolate, Bookstore, Coffee bean tea leaf, bodyshop) in the pre-departure area and a restaurant. There are ATM machines, a baggage sealing service and currency exchange stand (but they never have Singapore dollars). Check in was a breeze, done in several minutes. Passport control is quick. Once you enter the departure lounge, to the right is a food court that sells food to order (manly Asian dishes). There is a convenience store, some stores that sell traditional Bruneian foods and watch / perfume stores. I was told more stores will be added soon. The waiting area has good lighting, there are priority seats near the gate for those with young children and elderly people. The toilets were clean. There is a prayer room for Muslim travellers. On arrival there is a short walk to customs and immigration. Separate counters for local, ASEAN, Diplomatic and foreigners. There are plenty of trolleys at the baggage carousel. There is a green and red channel, there are several officers always on duty. I left a hand luggage on the plane, luckily I was able to retrieve it. There is a door at the side of KFC which leads back to the arrivals hall. The bag was aleady in the office for me to collect. In the arrivals hall there is a KFC and Burger King, also Counters for DST and Progressif which are the mobile phone carriers. You can purchase tourist sim cards which have minutes and data pre loaded. There is a counter for tourist information and Hertz / Avis car rental. Upon exiting the terminal there is a taxi service, taxis are metered. You can also use the ride hailing app Dart. There is a local bus service, but it's not available for the late flights. If you have a long layover and and your passport lets you exit the airport, the Airport mall is a 5 minute drive or 15 minute walk away, (but but be careful as there are no footpaths.)",POSITIVE,Neutral
Abbotsford Intl,airport,Bryan Wang,10/8/2019,"Since most flights to and from YXX are ULCC's, my expectations are low. Lack of flight info signs. Queuing times are non-existent. Clean terminal with easy seating. Lack of shops and food inside the secure area. Wi-Fi is poor.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Birmingham,airport,John Hyde,5/11/2024,"Monday 29th April what an absolute disgrace. 2 hours to get through security after being told 30 minutes. 4 lifts, 1 out of order, another reserved for staff when you escaped the great long queues. 2 conveyor belts working out of 6 very little staff available. On return 1 hour wait for luggage, an absolute disgrace. A final comment I will never use Birmingham again and yet only 20 minutes from home and have used this airports many many times and many times had problems but no more East Midlands much better.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,11/18/2013,Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal. One walks up a sort of sideways V shaped ramp to get to one's plane (I think they may offer use of umbrellas if it rains).,POSITIVE,Neutral
Bandung,airport,Julio Giovan Damanik,10/29/2016,"The new Bandung airport terminal is very different to the old terminal. Cleaner, more space, more shops, and more toilets.

Overall, good but could use more luggage belts in the arrival terminal and more parking spaces.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Beijing Daxing,airport,I Lancaster,12/14/2019,"As might be expected, clean and efficient. In fact, arriving at 07:00 the place was empty - there seemed to be only one other flight arrival around that time. But the gate is a long way from the immigration hall. There are moving walkways but it nonetheless took a while. Then a long wait for baggage. My main gripe, though, and a cautionary note: my Swiss army knife was confiscated at the train station. Carefully packed in checked baggage, never in carry-on, so no problem for the flight. But getting in to the ticket hall for the train to Beijing baggage is inspected and my knife was not allowed. Be warned! This made it an expensive train ticket. I would have enjoyed a coffee and snack but neither airport arrivals or the train station had anywhere open.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Bismarck,airport,1 reviewsAndy Zachmeier,2/19/2020,Bismarck Airport does not have a 24-hour Terminal. The Terminal closes 1/2 an hour after last flight for the day. The terminal will not re-open until 3am. Everyone in the Terminal will be required to leave from 1/2 an hour after last flight until 3am so that required security checks can be completed. It is not allowed to spend the night in the Bismarck Airport Terminal. Please plan appropriately.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Astana,airport,E Alter,9/29/2018,"This airport while still considered fairly new is still so very basic. The upstairs 3rd floor so called food court is a joke. The food is so basic, stale & expensive for what you get. With their limited English it makes it harder also. 3 of the places were on a break but still had limited menu. This food court needs a fast food outllet like most international airports. Most staff were friendly but facilities while clean are basic.",POSITIVE,Negative
Abuja,airport,S Adewale,3/3/2007,In Nigerian standards relatively clean and organized.

Bermuda,airport,Bertram Forbes,1/29/2007,Bermuda's airport and Bermuda generally could be much more a pleasurable experience if it's government got rid of some nasty aspects of Bermuda for American British Canadian and European tourists. I refer to the mere $100 in duty-free allowances it offers its own residents compared to $800 allowed in the USA - and only $35 allowed by Bermuda in duty- free allowances to tourists. These token allowances are cheap and nasty make the government look greedy and uncaring are rigorously applied and when residents or visitors bring in more a 30% duty applies.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Belize,airport,Gerald Preis,7/27/2004,My trip to Belize took me through BZE 3 times. It is a classic sleepy 2-room airport: an updated arrivals hall with a mechanical carousel a communal departure area serving the 4 or 6 gates (glass doors really) that lead to the tarmac separated by the small warm somewhat chaotic check-in area. Some staff were friendly and enthusiastic security checks were minimal. Few large jets come to BZE but they do seem to be timed near each other. Most flights are prop planes to the interior and the offshore reefs. There is a pleasant open air deck that allows views of arriving and departing passengers walking to and from their planes. There is nothing else to do while waiting for your flight. Bring a book. Amenities are few: tiny gifts shops snack bars and a cafeteria. A good place to people watch. Very stress-free and it serves its purpose. Ambergris Cay was our real destination. Well worth the trip!,POSITIVE,Neutral

Bacau,airport,E Damaneru,9/28/2024,This is the worst by far. Weve checked in online (we got the boarding passes ready) and when we got to the security they told us that we need to go to the check in (even if we ve already checked in) . At the check in desk we got other boarding passes (even if we had boarding passes aready) and before getting into the plane we got charged 248 lei for each passenger for the check in. Also after the security check there are no shops to buy cigarettes or food.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Abbotsford Intl,airport,L Meade,1/3/2024,"Terrible staff, terrible experience.  It first started at the restrooms when one cleaning lady closed off both the men's and women's. Although she was clearly still cleaning the men's, a casual inquiry as to if I could use the women's restroom in the meantime was dismissed in a very rude and condescending manner. Even just the decency of politely pointing me to a different restroom would have been much more appreciated. Next, there was no one at the Flair counter managing bags or check ins. Some of us approached another staff if they could contact or follow up on the counter personnel. Again, rudely dismissed instead of kindly explaining any situation. After that, I began to manage some of my personal belongings at a seating area. A cleaning lady in her phone started sweeping at my feet and completely ignoring me while wiping the floor literally where I was standing and managing my stuff. She clearly could have waited until I was done before doing that right where I was standing or at the very least say ""excuse me"". Finally, at the checkout security there were two lines and as I approached, I even asked if I could line up there. She said yes, and after putting down my belongings in bins, she asked me to move to the next security line because they were down a personnel. Individually, maybe these incidents may be small, but the collective experience together with how the staff addressed situations were generally rude and dismissive.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,P Martin,7/5/2017,"Delays, expensive, negligent, rude, unhelpful. Partner and I were flying Royal Brunei to KK (Kota Kinabalu) from Melbourne, our total transit time was 1 hr and 45 minutes. However upon arrival we find our 45 minute flight was delayed 5 hours. That's 5 hours from 7pm to just after midnight in an airport where it is impossible to get any kind of fresh food. 1 convenience store serving instant noodles, and 1 cafe that had stale pastries and day old meat pastas. Being a vegetarian there was nothing I could eat, apart from 2 minute noodles from the airport 'convenience' store. On our way back, I made the mistake of buying 2 bottles of whisky (both gifts) from KK International airport. The duty free attendant, despite taking note of my boarding pass into Brunei, did not mention anything about alcohol confiscation in Brunei. (I thought being sealed in Duty free packaging would be fine). However, as we passed customs to transit for 1 hour, the two bottles were confiscated, with not so much as a 'Sorry'. Instead the service woman smiled rather rudely and asked for our baggage tag that was given to us upon check in at KK airport from Royal Brunei airlines. Instead of taking time to explain why I had just lost over $150 AUD worth of goods, she instead just told me to read the tiny piece of paper that was stapled under the baggage tag. It read: ""All items in excess of 100 ml will be confiscated in Brunei, regardless of whether the items are purchased duty-free from another airport or packed in tamper-evident bags. Please note that no airline shall be held responsible for confiscated items."" I could not find this information anywhere on the Australian customs/border control website. At the duty free shop in KK I was not warned, at check in, the Royal Brunei clerk clearly said 'Here are your baggage tags', not 'Here are your baggage tags, and important information regarding carrying alcohol into Australia, since you are transitting Brunei'. Morale of the long story. Read every piece of paper you are given by airport and airline staff, no matter how small. And when stopping in Brunei airport, take no chances with your duty free liquor, or it is good bye money.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Aalborg,airport,M Andersen,8/7/2012,A very nice airy terminal - that seems modern enough. Free WIFI and free parking. Everything within walking distance.

Beijing Capital,airport,S Peele,10/20/2024,"I have flown many times in many countries in Asia but I’ve never seen such a high level of securitisation. There are literally thousands of facial recognition cctv cameras watching you, tracking what you do. Staff were chasing foreign travellers and ordering them to remove their hats (not in immigration or security, just anywhere in the airport where they wanted to track you). Foreign travellers arriving go to booths to be finger printed (this is becoming more common in Asia). Even to go through international transit, you will have your face photographed (and scanned into their systems). Then once you’re on board, Air China flights all have state security agents, dressed in black who walk up and down the flight carrying a camera. Not to mention that the plane safety video has a whole section on how you should not commit a “crime” on board.  I will never return and I advise others not to.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Altenburg,airport,R Heelas,10/13/2008,As with many small airports travelling to and from Altenburg is a pleasure. The terminal is about as big as a Drive-Through burger restaurant and there is free parking within 30m of the building. This airport is an excellent option for passengers travelling to or from the southern part of the former East Germany or to the north of Bavaria (I live in Bamberg and the drive is much shorter and more pleasant than to the next nearest Ryanair airport at Frankfurt Hahn). On the downside if you arrive early the Duty Free shop is very small and the restaurant is basic but the staff are friendly.,POSITIVE,Negative
Bangkok Don Muang,airport,Leo Vist,9/16/2020,"On the 4th of March, I was flying back to Bangkok from Tokyo. At the end of an 8 hour flight with N95 masks, I was exhausted, and didn't do the usual ""always look back the trolley"" search that I normally would. I didn’t realize it until I was getting ready the next morning, that I have lost my expensive skincare that I bought for mom as a gift. Brand new and properly packed in the duty free bag. I panicked and thought there was no hope that I would find the goods. I called the airport just to try our luck. The airport staff told me to describe the items that we lost and would contact us after checking with the lost and found department. Only a few moments later, the airport called me that they found my items at the lost and found. A janitor had turned them in. We can arrange to collect the items anytime. It all seemed crazy to me because the items were in perfect condition. I was so grateful and could not believe that my stuff would be able to be found. The airport staff were extremely helpful and nice. It made my day and I still feel so thankful even until today.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Bodrum,airport,Clive Heys,7/27/2019,"Problems with arrival and departure. Arrival: Arrived an hour late at 23.00. Three flights worth of passengers, about 500 people, arrived in passport control together. Six passport gates. All staffed but none working. Lights above each gate indicating which type of arrivals for which gate. Lights kept changing. Staff kept arriving and leaving each gate. No info displayed or given. After around 60 minutes, they started processing us. Total time from arrival to transfer coach, around 2 hours. Pretty inexcusable I’m afraid, given that they knew the flights were arriving, and when. Departure: no signage as to which queue to join, reliant on wandering Jet2 staff for info. Airport staff at initial security check very surly. Food and duty free area too busy, food and drinks expensive, duty free prices a lot higher than UK high street on average. Woefully inadequate seating. No helpful info. A further security check was suddenly invoked but only for gates 201 and 202. This was so slow that it would have jeopardised our departure, had we not already been delayed. No info at all about delay. Around 90 mins at gate with 8 staff and no info. No toilets for this time without going beck through security checkpoint. The security check at the departure gate was the FIFTH and last. Question, if you need to do a fifth security check, are you not admitting that at least one (I’m being polite here) of your previous checks was a little bit of a waste of time? Only actually arrived at Manchester about 40 mins late, but that’s not an achievement, it’s an indication of the fraudulent amount of slack built into the flight times, a practice which is only “bettered” by the UK rail industry.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Auckland,airport,W Keale,2/13/2025,"My flight to Brisbane was scheduled to take off at 6:45 am, so I arrived at the airport at 5:00 am, checked in my bag real quick and in 5 minutes I was queuing for passport control, and because my passport is not one of the 10 privileged passports that are allowed to use the egates, we had to queue for 35 minutes, and we complete passport control we have to queue for security check at the same queue as everyone else. So if a US, Korean or New Zealand citizen arrives at the airport 45 minutes after I do, they will still be passing security check before I do, what kind of discrimination is this? At least we should have our own security queue. The suffering didn’t end there, we had to queue for 30 minutes in security control queue, and because I travel a lot for work, I knew the procedure, i took out my laptop from the bag, but, surprisingly, my tray was sent for manual checking, by the way, almost 50% of the bags went to manual check, that is another 15 minutes queue wait, and when it was my turn the inspector didn’t even touch the bag like what she did with the others, where she frisked all of them, she told me that I’m good and nothing is wrong here - why did you make me wait 15 minutes then?

She actually engaged in an argument with someone standing in line. When I told her the kiosks weren’t operating properly and that I’d never done a bag drop off and could she help me, she just walked away. I started asking her another question, and someone just interrupted her - and she attended to him! My granddaughter and I were in line for over an hour - yes, lots of people had issues and were at the counter for half an hour - but someone could have created a line with people who didn’t have any issues - just a simple need of a ticket and checking in a bag. One of the worst experiences I’ve had at Logan Airport!",NEGATIVE,Neutral

The Starbucks queue is even longer. There are no spare seats in the terminal and all of this seems to be ok with airport management.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Accra Kotoka,airport,Klaus Malling Olsen,3/7/2016,"During rush-hours (evening) Kotoka Airport felt very crowded, but check-in was surprising quick, as well as security check, this works well if you arrive at least 3 hours before departure. Rush hours here mean departure within half an hour for several wide-body plans, creating a severe lack of seating and extremely long rows of slowly boarding passengers, making you realize that you are in a far too small airport to handle several aircrafts with a capacity of 3-400 passengers within a short time limit. Thi is especially the case when you arrive. The rows of arriving passengers at the immigration was long enough to last for almost one hour, and was followed by usual slow deliverance of luggage. Furthermore, the staff controlling the yellow cards for vaccinations are not very well inset in the rules, including the knowledge that persons over a certain age are not required vaccination against yellow fever. However, as a whole Kotoka was not too bad an experience, just accept some more time than required in more updated and modern airports.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Birmingham,airport,Anja Crounse,7/7/2024,"Avoid this airport at all cost! I have traveled quite a bit in my life, but Birmingham Airport was an experience I never voluntarily hope to relive. I now better understand why my 80 year old mom preferred NOT seeing her son than having to go through this ordeal. This was twenty years ago. Nothing much has changed. Chaotic, going from one long snake line into the next, being ""herded"" into an elevator only to be driven into the next line. I truly felt like cattle. I wonder how those taxfree shops make any money, because you sure have no time or energy left to shop (or get a bite to eat). And when you finally arrive at the gate and actually glad that the plane was delayed (otherwise it would have been a close call), you have to sit on the floor to rest your feet from being on your feet for hours on end. My advise: pick another airport and take the train to Birmingham OR go via Dover and drive up to Birmingham. Driving on the left of the road is less stressful.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Antananarivo,airport,C Nelson,8/23/2016,"Madagascar is a wonderful country but Antananarivo airport is so poor that it really makes visiting a trial. For entry I counted that my passport was checked 6 times from leaving the aircraft until finally getting into our taxi. No idea why, but it took a long time. You must have the entry fee (around 25 euros per person for short stay) in cash (Euros, Dollar and Pounds accepted). If you don't, staff escort you landside to a cash point and bring you back. There are numerous stamps and writing and more queuing, all of which seems totally superfluous. People that look like staff often aren't and are the 'porters'. They are very aggressive - there's no point trying to take your own bag, unless it's strapped to you as they take it and then expect to be paid. It is also very difficult to keep it to just 1 porter, again expecting to be paid. I know it's a poor country, but some regulation of these porters is required, especially coming airside. I suppose overall, the time to clear wasn't that bad as they saved that for the exit. Again, there was the obsession with passport checks - 5 times it was checked, as well as my finger prints being taken - no idea why on exit, but not on entry. That wasn't the worst - our hotel delivered us 2 hours and 30 mins before the departure. We were about half way down the check-in queue. The plane had a capacity of 89 people. Checking-in took 2 hours. The cabin bags had labels too - not required in other locations. Some people seemed to have a check-in form, but we didn't need one. After that, then they said a form had to be filled-in, with lots of totally irrelevant information. Similar to the form on entry with info like where you stayed. The form wasn't available whilst you queued for check-in. Another member of staff then turned up, offering a pen and wanting to be paid - we had no currency left by then. Then there were more checks and the finger print scan. A baggage check until finally getting through to departures. By the time we got through, the plane was already boarding, so I didn't see the departure lounge. In the end the plane was 30 mins late departing due to these delays. Overall a really poor experience, which would be so easy to improve. My recommendation is to keep your bags close (not for security reasons), be very specific what help you need / want and for departures, be there 3 hours in advance.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Joaquim Coelho,12/18/2014,"I flew a couple of times this year into Belo Horizonte's Confins International airport and I must say that this airport lacks the basics. It was supposed to be renovated for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a few weeks before the tournament the airport was in utter chaos. It seemed as if I was in a construction sight. I came back during the World Cup and things improved a little giving it a more pleasant atmosphere. I am Brazilian so the language is not a problem but I spoke with some people that passed through the airport and they complained how few people spoke English. The airport does not receive many international flights. Only flights are to Buenos Aires-Argentina Miami-USA Lisboa-Portugal and Panama City-Panama and only a few of those are daily. Most of the times I arrived to this airport were on domestic flights but in July I came from the USA using a Copa Airlines flight from Panama City. I was puzzled as to why the plane did not parked directly at the gate since it arrived early in the morning and there were many finger gates with no planes parked whatsoever. Immigration officials were not friendly and showed little professionalism the lady that checked my passport had one earphone on and was chewing gum with her mouth open. The luggage carrousel is a complete mess as the area is very cramped and small. Customs was the only positive as once I had my luggage I went through it quickly. This airport has very bad air conditioning and in the summer it can be horribly hot inside and having to wait to board with very little seating can be a hassle. It is really far from downtown Belo Horizonte but the roads are good and I recommend taking the ""Conexão Aeroporto"" buses that take you straight to the center of the city for a rate of R$ 21 (around 10 dollars). This option is very advantageous because taking a cab directly from the airport is ridiculously expensive. Have seen worse airports but this one is one that I am certainly not very fond of. Does it's job but could be far off better and I hope it does get better once the renovations are finished.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Bags arrived in a couple more minutes and we were out and looking for the car rental desk. On return, there were no queues and at security we did not have to take anything out of our bags. Our flex-economy ticket gave us access to the Aspire lounge which was very quiet but well stocked with food and beverages.

Bengkulu,airport,3 reviewsRafael Suarez,6/27/2018,"I traveled to Bengkulu, Indonesia to visit friends for the first time in November 2017. Flew on Lion Air. Upon arriving at the airport we deplane using stairs and walked on the tarmac to the arrival building. It was late afternoon with the sun just about to set. The airport building is very quaint. Nice outdoor gardens greet you and on the day I arrived a nice afternoon breeze. Slowly make the way to the inside of the terminal where one luggage belt, half inside the terminal and a portion outside the terminal awaits. The luggage eventually arrives and it gives you time to see the pictures of some of the sights to see in Bengkulu. Once luggage in hand you go outside where there are various options for transport to where ever you are going. I was met by friends that took me to the hotel. Two weeks later, I left Bengkulu and experienced the departure area. You go through the usual security immediately upon entering the terminal, (say your good byes outside the door,) then walk to the check in desk where you obtain your boarding pass and check your luggage. English is not widely spoken at the airport if at all, but I had no issues whatsoever. You then go to the gate area, nice seats, air conditioned, tv's, bathrooms, and probably restaurants though I left on the first flight out and I not see anything to buy food or drinks. Eventually they called the flight, once again no English, and we boarded the same way, nice walk outside to the waiting aircraft. All in all a really nice experience in this airport.",POSITIVE,Negative

Akron–Canton,airport,2 reviewsJoseph Leonetti,1/1/2022,"Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Mokhalad Alrubaye,7/11/2024,"I had a very bad experience starting with Berlin Airport.

Restrooms outside terminal however few.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Aguascalientes,airport,2 reviewsHoward Atkins,10/20/2016,This is a small airport but over the past couple of years it has improved a lot. The customs and immigration are polite and fast with the baggage also coming fast. There is a coffee shop outside the secure area and also one inside but the coffee outside is better. There is also now free WiFi in the airport. There is a lounge but this is not connected to the airlines but for payment. No need to arrive to early,POSITIVE,Neutral
Burlington,airport,J Butler,7/20/2013,It is the only airport regionally that people have to use. It is awful: understaffed clerks are rude flights often late or missed because of understaffing and can't make lines. It is customary to have people or entire groups of people get moved up in line in order for them to make their flights. Just plan on having things go wrong if flying through Burlington.,NEGATIVE,Neutral

Brasilia,airport,G Castro,9/23/2009,Brasilia airport is probably the best Brazilian airport. The shopping/eating area is good and with a great variety. The information desk is good and people friendly not to mention the architecture that is beautiful. The bad things about the airport are Transportation - Buses not as frequent as they should be. No metro or train. Boarding area - once you pass Security the airport is too crowded and not having the same amenities as the pre-boarding area make the journey less comfortable. Too small for the traffic it has. Drop off/Pick Up passengers: There is a lack of enforcing the laws and people park in the drop off areas making it difficult to approach sometimes.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Boise,airport,C Anderson,2/7/2022,Forgot my mask and expected to be greeted with a negative/cold attitude but it was quite the opposite.

Each attendant I came across from the ticket counter-TSA security-gate were very friendly. Thank you for starting my travel so well.,POSITIVE,Negative
Borg El Arab,airport,A Abdo,1/25/2019,The staff are unprofessional and have poor manners. The officers are arrogant and disrespectful. The airport building is nice but not kept well.

Baku,airport,45 reviewsDiogo Freitas,1/27/2024,I paid 7 times more the normal rate to go from this airport to the city center. There are no ATMs on arrivals nor SIM cards shops. Your option is to accept the rides from the men who pest the arrivals area. They even have electronic terminals inside their taxis for you to pay by card their immensely overpriced rides. They are very well organized. Be very careful and smarter than me. Arrive with money of the country and call a Bolt or Uber by connecting to the airport WiFi.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Antwerp Deurne,airport,S Smith,12/20/2009,Fantastic airport. I go in and out at least once a month. Yesterday I timed my arrival and from walking off the plane to being outside at a taxi was 43 seconds!!! 15 minute check in for departures.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,10/23/2011,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports. It's easier to use than Rio or Sao Paulo at least until you get to the cramped gate area.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Blackpool,airport,Paul Wharmby,9/8/2013,We travelled to Turkey on Jet2 mid-August returning early-September. We travelled from Blackpool as the holiday was some £250 cheaper than using Manchester. The car park ticket machine had run out of tickets but that didn't matter as the barriers to P2 had been broken off. We parked a good 5 minutes' walk from the terminal but it's free so I don't really see that being a problem. The terminal building is very basic and is more reminiscent of a coach station but check-in and security were both quick and easy (as was paying the ADF) and we were sitting in the bar area enjoying our first drink of the holiday while we'd still have been in the security queue at Manchester. An important point was that because we were going on a small plane to a small airport check-in at Dalaman on our return was incredibly easy drawing jealous stares from fellow travellers who were in 200-long queues. On our return to Blackpool from wheels stop through security and baggage reclaim to leaving the airport took less than 30 minutes. You absolutely cannot get better. The airport has a runway planes somewhere to sit and somewhere to get a drink. What else do you need?,POSITIVE,Negative
Astana,airport,Jack Sheldon,11/2/2006,Small ultramodern terminal. Check-in was fairly efficient except for flatheads who queue-jumped. In the end I had to spread my elbows to get attention. Business-class desk not manned. Unable to check-in bags or myself to connecting flights (even on the same airline). There’s not a great deal to do in the airport whilst waiting for flights. Once airside all there is is a small bar. In theory the terminal is non- smoking though there is a separate smoking room but the whole terminal smelt of smoke most of the time I was there.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Beijing Daxing,airport,6 reviewsSun Xiaoou,2/5/2021,"The traffic of Beijing Daxing airport is very convenient. You can get there by high-speed rail. The design of Daxing airport is very grand and novel. There are many self-service check-in machines in Daxing airport. There are many open windows at the manual check-in place, and the queuing time is short. The efficiency of security inspection is high, but there are few open channels, which leads to a long queue time. After passing the security check, there are many restaurants in it, and the price is the same as that in the urban area. The departure and arrival of Daxing airport are mixed. There are many turntables at the baggage claim area, and the waiting time is very short. It's just that the airport guidelines need to be improved. I was a little confused when I went to Daxing airport for the first time. Airport WiFi is fast and supports takeout at the gate.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Ancona,airport,Stephen Smith,9/12/2022,"Very clean Airport, friendly helpful staff, great that it’s all on one level. My departure was late 11.00pm and was disappointed in the fact that the duty free shop was closed. Also it took a while for the cafe bar to open and I wanted a pizza slice heated up which the assistant was reluctant to do , but I said I would wait. When we got through passport control all seating was taped off so a huge bunch of passengers, and some sitting in the floor. No staff around for about 20 mins. Some passengers lifted up the tape to sit down so a majority followed only to be asked to move out 10 mins later. Also no Air conditioning so it was hot and sweaty. So I would say this Airport is not good for later flights.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bourgas,airport,P Woods,9/4/2021,"The worst Airport security/Passport control ever encountered.

Recommend the manager visit a real airport.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Astana,airport,Alibek Taizhanov,7/31/2013,Astana airport is small but very good. The staff is ok. The wifi connection works pretty well queuing times are very short.

Bangkok Don Muang,airport,D Barter,6/2/2022,"The domestic terminal is better than the international, seemingly having been refurbished during Covid. Both have adequate food options. Plenty of seating. Clean. Domestic departures. At security beware the overzealous and brusque female personnel with their metal detector wands. A small coin inadvertently left in a pocket will immediately incur their wrath. Perhaps their rigorous practical training could also include occasional use of the words 'please' and 'thank you'. Polite manners to avoid confrontations are as important when dealing with foreigners as they are with the locals. International departures: leave plenty of time for passport control and security which is efficient but there can be long queues. At last, the the BTS runs out to Don Muang and the station is not too far away - making the old taxi lottery system a thing of the past.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Bogota,airport,F Gorte,2/25/2023,"Worst airport in South America.

Bari Palese,airport,K Bertsen,11/5/2021,Bari airport security officers were extremely rude after politely asking for a hand check of my photographic film. The way they treat you when asking something of them was very rude. First they speak perfect English and all of a sudden they “can’t speak English” and start ignoring you and making jokes to their colleagues about you. The film I wanted them to hand check does  get damaged by the X-Ray bari uses. So what’s the problem to do a hand check?,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Berlin Schonefeld,airport,Ksenia Posadskova,1/15/2020,I was flying outside of the EU and having the non-EU passport I waited more than an hour in a narrow corridor to go over the passport checks.

Barcelona,airport,J Woolley,1/5/2025,"The staff really let this airport down. And everything everyone else said negatively below (heat of airport, difficult layout, unhelpful security/info) unfortunately remains true as of Jan 2025. Airport amenities wise average, but the staff, especially passport control seem to actually enjoying belittling, ignoring & dismissing people. It’s horrible to experience that level of nastiness. As others have said the passport queues are ridiculously long & it’s a long walk across the airport. It takes time to get to the gate with elderly/infirm people or young children. We set off for our gate the second it popped up - when we got to passport control the queue was huge. Many people in the queue were worried about missing their flight, us included. When we explained, extremely politely, to the queue staff our concerns she shrugged, said she didn’t care & coldly told us we had to queue at the back. Nice! When we finally got to the man (policia nationale) stamping our passports, he asked if we were going to London. When we said yes, (knowing we were now cutting it fine for our flight) he stamped one then literally put the others to one side while he spent a few minutes answering a what’s app message totally ignoring us (the picture which had popped up on his phone made it clear it was a personal text). We politely waited & bit our tongues knowing he was enjoying his little moment of power until he finally slowly stamped the other passports & literally threw them back at us. Our kids were bewildered as to why the man ‘didn’t like us’! Whole experience stressful & made us feel completely unwelcome. Such a shame - we really loved Barcelona but the stress of almost missing our flight & being treated so nastily means we will visit Seville or Madrid (or another country entirely) next time which we found a much more pleasant experience overall.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Asuncion Silvio Pettirossi,airport,Jonathan Lacoste,2/6/2006,Asuncion is a small and simple airport. From airport gate to curbside the distance is no more than 50 meters. Upon arrival on AA (this was last month before AA cancelled their service to ASU) immigration was quick and efficient but baggage claim seemed to take forever. I must’ve waited for over 40 minutes which was unusual. Baggage claim in ASU is slow but not that slow. Be prepared when arriving into Asuncion’s baggage claim area to be swarmed by baggage porters looking to make a big tip. As soon as you tell one “no” another one will approach you. Departure wise the departure hall is not that big and can easily get crowded. Especially between the hours of 1600-1800 when flights to Buenos Aires and a couple of flights to Sao Paulo are departing around that time block. It seems in Asuncion when one person is going out of the country at least six relatives show up to say goodbye. Thus the departure hall can easily turn into a sea of people. There are two small restaurants on each side of the departure hall but these were full of departing passengers and their large number of relatives/friends. Check-in quick and efficient. AA had Asuncion’s departure tax already included in the ticket price so I skipped the departure tax window. I’m not sure if Varig does the same and Dale’s review answers the question on TAM. No line for immigration and it’s off to wait in the departure gate area. A restaurant is inside that allows for a bite to eat or a final opportunity to sample Paraguay’s local beers. I always chose the latter. A number of street-style shops selling Paraguayan leather and lace products are located in the middle of the gate area. Between them and the duty free shop in the corner of the waiting area I really couldn’t find anything worth buying. Business class passengers on AA did not have a business class lounge to wait in and I saw no indication of one for Varig’s business class passengers either. TAM flights into Asuncion are all Y configured. ASU has made some improvements over the years such as the addition of the duty free shop. Overall Asuncion’s airport is a basic and “gets the job done” type of airport.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Bergen,airport,Peter Thackray,12/13/2016,"A relatively small but busy airport serving a key city on the coast of Norway. Most flights are domestic within Norway. Domestic Arrivals mix with departures and there are 2 baggage belts on the ground floor behind the check-in desks, no specific separation between general public and flying public. On the ground floor there are 2 convenience shops selling snacks, drinks etc and a small café/bar. The Check-in is predominantly self-service with very few staff evident. Upstairs to Security and Departures. The main domestic departures has a few food outlets, a book shop and a convenience shop, there is a further section for International Travellers with full Duty Free options. Most planes land at a gate with pier so little need to be outside. No announcements or ""Last Calls"" are made so you need to look at one of the many monitors to check your flight status. A small but efficient airport which probably gets very busy on Cruise Ship days. Free WiFi.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Beijing Capital,airport,G Madronio,9/6/2024,"Worst airport I've ever been to. There are no information boards or help desks despite the vastness of the airport and no effort for passengers who speak anything but Mandarin. The WiFi is useless because it does NOT work, no matter how many times you try. I had to pay extra to use my data roaming just to communicate with my parent because they were using the wheelchair service and they separated us. Due to their lack of communication, my dad who was using a wheelchair was left waiting and was the only passenger to use the wheelchair service who was without his family. Air China airline staff told my brother who was putting his bag in the cabin overhead bins to wait and allowed at least 100 passengers through the aisles before I finally took matters into my own hands and stored the bag in the overhead bins myself. The blankets were NOT in plastic bags. I will definitely avoid this airport in future and neither will I use Air China.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Cagliari,airport,Federico Muscogiuri,4/25/2005,Clean and efficient I was very impressed with Elmas airport. Staff are friendly and the airport is very well connected to the city centre by bus.

Abidjan,airport,D Sane,12/13/2017,"I have been transiting a few times recently. The airport looks clean, nice and modern, but it's very disorganised. Boarding passes are checked more than five times, while once or twice should be enough. Security screening sees long queues up into the immigration area, due to excessive scrutiny. Transit passengers need to queue to have their boarding pass checked, a practice I haven't seen anywhere else in the world. This all adds to delays, affecting connecting flights as well. For boarding Air Côte d'Ivoire, passengers are asked to wait outside of the terminal, for a bus to the plane, several destinations combined. This kind of takes away the point of checking the boarding pass five times over before completing the boarding process within the terminal. WiFi is free for just half an hour. The terminal is modern and clean, but even at this small size it already looks very overstretched. Lomé Airport does a better job of being a hub in West Africa.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bradley,airport,G Bartel,6/21/2022,"Hartford airport is very small - I arrived 2 hours before my flight because I was coming from Vermont and wanted to allow for traffic, but that was way too early for what was available at the airport. The hall immediately past security has plenty of restaurants to choose from, along with a number of rocking chairs that have a nice view of the apron. The Gates 1-12 concourse also looked like it had been recently renovated and also had a nice selection of restaurants and shops. However, the pre-security areas and the Gates 20-30 concourse were dark and dim, and were unpleasant places to wait. Fortunately, everything at this airport is very close, so if your flight leaves from Gates 20-30 you can wait in the post-security hall and go to your gate at the last moment. Still, it'd be nice if the airport would renovate the Gates 20-30 concourse and the pre-security areas so that it looks as nice as the Gates 1-12 concourse.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Accra Kotoka,airport,Jacob Thomas,3/21/2024,"The facilities are fine. The check in staff at the checkin time is ok. When you reach the boarding gate, they will make you stand in a queue for an unnecessary check to tick the boarding pass with their pen and then make you wait again. The staff at this check point has already interviewed you at the check in counter. They have a rude behaviour and tone and not friendly at all.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

In fact, arriving at 07:00 the place was empty - there seemed to be only one other flight arrival around that time. But the gate is a long way from the immigration hall. There are moving walkways but it nonetheless took a while. Then a long wait for baggage. My main gripe, though, and a cautionary note: my Swiss army knife was confiscated at the train station. Carefully packed in checked baggage, never in carry-on, so no problem for the flight. But getting in to the ticket hall for the train to Beijing baggage is inspected and my knife was not allowed. Be warned! This made it an expensive train ticket. I would have enjoyed a coffee and snack but neither airport arrivals or the train station had anywhere open.",NEUTRAL,Negative

Highly recommend using this service if you have a family member with disabilities.

Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Mark Evans,10/31/2003,One for the historians of airport architecture a real time-warp from the 1960s and earlier. This was the original pre-WW2 Berlin airport. The paucity of flights serving Tempelhof make for a very stress-free environment. Emerging from the terminal one finds oneself in an ordinary residential street the facade of the terminal blending in with the neighbouring apartment blocks. The U-Bahn station is just 300 m away and one is in the heart of Berlin cheaply and in double-quick time. But look again at that facade towards the top: there's a gap.

Boston Logan,airport,LeRoy McDonald,8/29/2024,"I had the absolutely worst experience at Logan airport today (8-28-2024) First, we were in the security line when the scanners broke down. So, we had to leave the line and get into another line. Fine, this happens, so we move to the back of a different line. Then as we finally got to the point when it was our turn. Then an airport person comes with a wheelchair person and goes before us, no problem. Now it's our turn again, but then another airport person comes with someone else, not handicapped and the two of them just rudely walk right in front of us. No explanation. No ""sorry or ""excuse us"", nothing. Of course, at this point I am now tired of trying to get through this line, so I had said ""Excuse me"". The airport person started flipping her airport badge at me saying she can do anything with this badge. She was scary, and I was really taken aback by her attack. Instead of saying ""Sorry I needed to get this lady through security"", she started yelling that she could call security or the police on me. I was looking to the person that was in the process of taking our ID and she did not understand what was happening either. We were just grateful that this rude, person was walking away now. I probably should have called security on her right away but didn't. This incident really bothered me the rest of the day and I really regret that I did not get her name.

Antwerp Deurne,airport,Anthony Kent,1/12/2016,"Antwerp used to be my favourite airport. Anybody traveling regularly between the Antwerp/Eindhoven regions and London has been well-served (though other destinations are limited). The highish fares were offset by the fact that free parking was available. As of late 2015 this situation has changed, however, as all the parking areas have been enclosed and high charges imposed for parking. Regrettably, therefore, although the airport is small and very pleasant to use, it can no longer compete financially with Eindhoven and I will no longer be using it.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

And the biggest head-scratcher of all: checked luggage. Who thought of the ingenious idea of making you check your luggage, then search a huge room for it later along with everyone else?

One bad thing though: Lack of plugs to charge phones! And if they have, they don't have like a universal plug, only an Argentinian one.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Altenburg,airport,R Heelas,10/13/2008,As with many small airports travelling to and from Altenburg is a pleasure. The terminal is about as big as a Drive-Through burger restaurant and there is free parking within 30m of the building. This airport is an excellent option for passengers travelling to or from the southern part of the former East Germany or to the north of Bavaria (I live in Bamberg and the drive is much shorter and more pleasant than to the next nearest Ryanair airport at Frankfurt Hahn). On the downside if you arrive early the Duty Free shop is very small and the restaurant is basic but the staff are friendly.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Abidjan,airport,Anoma Yao,6/30/2014,Small airport but modern and clean facility. No hustlers in the terminal unlike in most African airports. Not much queuing at check-in immigration and security. Air-conditioning functions toilets are clean airbridges and no pax busses but poor amenities: no wifi tiny duty free zone and unattractive lounge.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Beirut,airport,Shane Zouein,8/14/2019,"Even though I am Lebanese and should proudly put a high grade for my national airport, I cannot but curse the authorities and the staff there for the big mess created. I came in 3 hours before my flight departure to Europe whereby I couldn't do an online check-in (Coincidence that Europeans have blocked online check-in for Beirut?) I managed to miss my plane due to the waiting line at the first scanner. 3 hours prior to my flight and I missed it! No help from any security or staff to skip the line, I feel ashamed by such incompetency.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bocas Del Toro,airport,Andre Franca,12/25/2012,BDT-PAC. The airport is located on the Colon island you can actually walk into town but still taxis will charge you only 2 usd that's nothing really! There's only one building very small one x-ray and two counters one for each airline there are no carousels you'll have to wait them to offload your bags so you can pick them up on arrivals hall on departure the airline staff will open your bags to search for dangerous goods etc. The airport was under refurbishment but I believe it will soon need a better upgrade!,NEUTRAL,Negative

Belgrade,airport,G Vegri,10/4/2024,"It looks like a permanent construction site that has been ongoing for years. The transfer process for flights, in the case of bus stands, is extremely poorly organized, with long queues in the sun, rain, or cold to enter the terminal without any protection, and there are no clear signs for the transfer. Air Serbia's new check-in counters are claustrophobic and confusingly marked. In the new part of the terminal, however, there are now some more shops and cafés, although still absolutely not enough for the number of passengers. Even in a new terminal toilets are always dirty.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bordeaux,airport,Christine Morgan,9/29/2024,"Arrival seemed not too bad. Long walk from the Airplane. Departure was not great. After security there are no seats or space so we opted to pay to go in the Lounge. It was dire!! Filthy carpets and stale sandwiches that had been left out. Minimal food choices however, at least we got a seat. Guess people know how awful the lounge is as for a period of time we were the only two people there. Called to the gate an hour before departure there herded into an area to wait for the flight (which hadn't even arrived) - we did get a seat here. Pretty poor show for Bordeaux.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Brasilia,airport,G Villela,4/8/2009,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice. But a light-rail line is planned for the next couple of years and that should improve things a lot.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Anchorage,airport,M McManus,10/16/2011,Went to Anchorage in late 2011. Airport has some restaurants on the security side of the airport but not a good choice and the quality was not too good. The gift shops on the other hand are excellent especially if you are looking for Native American art. Be warned that quite a few souvenirs are like snow shakers with water which will be taken off you by security if you need to pass through them again. Information screens were useful. Plenty of seating and quite a view out of the terminal window.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Bergerac,airport,R Vines,5/6/2017,"It's a small airport with the most basic of facilities, but there were no delays in either direction. I hope that means they have sorted out immigraton, though it may be that my BA flight from London City arrived at a quiet time. My only gripe is about one woman on security who was quite unfriendly when she told me I had to return to check-in because she didn't like the look of a vase I had in my carry-on bag. Otherwise, the staff seemed quite friendly.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Tim Parsons,12/28/2016,"Possibly the slowest airport I have been through. Long queues arriving and departing.

Strange, because the island and the people we met on the island were great.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Aberdeen,airport,G Protano,7/12/2020,"The airport is clean and easy to go, the price for the drop off is high as 3 GBP. And the security staff need to be educated to dealing with passenger.

Addis Ababa,airport,H Smart,9/29/2023,"What a shambles this airport was for our very recent transits. The bus transfer from the incoming flight took forever and by the time we got to security the approximately ten wide column of people had to go down to one to go though security. When we got to the security screening there were no boxes to put liquids, laptops etc. into, and when someone eventually appeared with a stack of them it was a free for all as there wasn't enough to go round. Having survived security we had four hours before our connection to Dar Es Salaam. There were nowhere near enough seats and no air conditioning despite how warm it was. When the gate information came up, (C6 I think it was), we went to our departure gate to find there were two flights going from the same gate before ours, so there were hundreds of people waiting at our gate along with hundreds of others waiting for several other gates all in the same row. The electronic departure board stopped working, no staff to ask for information and another slow bus transfer out to the plane. The return experience was not much better although slightly better organised at security screening. Still not enough seats and still very hot in the main areas. When we went to our gate we had to wait to be admitted to gates A14 - 16 as again there were two flights leaving that area before ours. Seats were very difficult to get and when we finally went through to A15 we had to go through another security screening with shoes and belts off, again. When boarding started it was a free for all until a man appeared and stopped anyone who wasn't in zone 2, but as no announcement was made no-one knew it was boarding by zone number. He disappeared and a lady then appeared and held up three fingers which we assumed, correctly I'm pleased to say, that zone three could board, but again, no announcement. The one good point was no bus transfer. We hope we never have to transit through Bole again.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Abuja,airport,S Adewale,3/3/2007,In Nigerian standards relatively clean and organized. However I was bored out of my mind when waiting for my flight because the shopping and entertainment possibilities is nil.

Bergen,airport,P Thackray,2/20/2018,"New airport building opened in August 2017. Large and airy construction gives a positive feeling to airport experience. International Arrivals involve a bit of walking to the Baggage Reclaim and International Arrivals which happen on the ground floor. Car Rental, Café and Bureau de Change all within the terminal building. Bus, Taxi and Tram are out by the front door. Undercover walkways connect to short stay car parks. Departures are on the 1st floor with the usual automated check-in. Security pretty quick with more capacity when things get busy. The Departure Lounge overlooks the end of the runway and has air bridges to most departure gates - some bus departures for small aircraft parked remotely. Good selection of shops and cafes. A big improvement on the old terminal building.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Baghdad,airport,M Ziaebrahimi,8/14/2010,Arrived from Tehran by MahanAir around noon at Baghdad airport (BGW) for the second time. Arrival hall quite warm maybe 34 degrees centigrade outside was about 46 degrees immigration is not so fast but working. Toilets are grim you can find shops and exchange services around as well as small shops for some drink or snacks. Internet cafe is available and not so expensive. You have to use special busses or cars to leave the airport terminal. these cars will ask for USD15 and will not take you to the city of Baghdad but to a hot dusty open area where you can take a taxi. departing to Tehran from Baghdad airport was very time consuming due to severe security measures in Baghdad. You have to leave your hotel at least 5 hours before your departure time. Again you have to use special cars or buses and the same rate would be charged. before reaching at terminal you have to pass through 4 security check points where all baggage and passports would be checked. they use dogs for baggage. It was about 50 degrees centigrade and we had to wait under sunlight for 30 minutes for last checkpoint before entering the terminal. Another two x- rays inside terminal before check-in area. Check in was fast passport control was OK and the transit hall was much better than arrival hall enough seats good air conditioned and peaceful place with some shops and restaurants. Due to severe security measures in Iraq and specially in Baghdad you have to take special cars 4 hours before your departure time due to unpredicted delays and interruption which may happen in check points. Anyway the Baghdad airport service is much better and improved comparing two years ago that used it for first time.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,Joaquin Quinto,11/5/2008,Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns.

Austin,airport,1 reviewsM Hayes,8/25/2023,"I have a been a frequent traveler of Austin-Bergstrom Airport (AUS/KAUS) since the airport opened back in 1999. I have seen the airport grow and change over the years. The changes over the years have been for the better! Notable things about Austin-Bergstrom International (AUS): - there are two terminals the (main) Barbara Jordan terminal where all the restaurants, lounges and stores are, and the South Terminal currently Allegiant and Frontier Airlines. - there is a family viewing area outside the airport for watching planes and having a picnic. There are currently 4 lounges (AA, UA, DL and a Chase Sapphire Terrace) - there are many good places to eat including many local restaurants (my favorite are Taco Deli, Salt Lick BBQ, Second Bar + Kitchen, Annie's, and Juiceland. - it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end of the terminal to the other, along the way you will see lots of places to eat, drink and shop. Pros: clean, great dining, bars, and rest areas. The Delta lounge is the nicest lounge in the airport. Cons: restaurants close early, so if you arrive on a late(ish) flight you will not have food options.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Blackpool,airport,Helen Heron,9/17/2014,We have just returned from a trip to Tenerife with Jet2 and used Blackpool for the first time as the flight times from here were excellent. Yes it is only small but check in a security were swift with no problems encountered and adequate facilities for a drink and a little browse in the duty free. On our return again swift baggage claim and on the road home within half an hour. The only downside we arrived well before we were meant to and check in wasn't even open however the parking was a nightmare. We went right round the back to the overflow car park and only at the very last minute managed to squeeze on the end of someone else. I cant imagine what would have happened if wed left it later we would have missed our flight. Also it was a long walk to the terminal building and it was pouring with rain we were amazed their wasn't and easier way in to the building also our car on return was covered in dust from all the passing vehicles. This aside I would travel from here again as the good out weighs the bad but I really think you should assess the parking situation as this is very limited for the passengers travelling and is letting this airport down?,POSITIVE,Negative

Abuja,airport,Alan Wan,2/28/2012,On arrival as we flew Business Class we were near the front of the line for immigration. Baggage did not take too long to arrive. Finding a taxi was not obvious but a friendly airport employee walked us across the car park to the taxis - make sure you agree a price in advance. When we departed Abuja although it was quiet and there was no one in front it still took an hour to check-in. Bags had to be x-rayed and PAX go through a metal detector bags then manually weighed and manually searched after which we could check- in. Due to a computer crash boarding cards were manually written - however ground staff later gave out printed cards at the gate. The business lounge was rubbish but at least the sofas were comfy. At the gate all passengers and bags were searched again - by very friendly staff.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Aalborg,airport,S Kroes,2/13/2013,This is a nice and modern airport at the moment they are expanding the airport so there is a lot of building going on but in the departure area you will not notice this very much. The Airport has got free Wifi and a small restaurant with shop on the land side. Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.,POSITIVE,Negative
Bergerac,airport,S Gaudicheau,6/6/2010,Arrival was great. I was at passport control within 2 minutes of landing. On the way back it was another story. I couldn't do the online check in and I found out at the airport that it's not provided when you fly from Bergerac. You have to queue with everybody in order to get your boarding pass even if you only have hand luggage. Ground personnel very slow until the call was made to invite people for boarding. They then suddenly were very quick. The toilets aren't provided with coat or handbag hangers which I find not practical.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Bari Palese,airport,39 reviewsH Bertens,3/2/2024,"A small airport serving the city of Bari. It's clean and functional but looks like nothing has changed over 30 years.

Antalya,airport,David Stewart,8/25/2024,"Arrival simple. Through immigration quickly as in most Turkish airports. Departures is a totally different story. It's not organised chaos just chaos. Totally third world. Check in a nightmare. Despite checking in online have to queue for paper boarding card. Next are the passport control lines. To be fair this is probably the quickest bit of the constant queues. Security next which is crazy. They're either talking to each other or screaming at some passenger. Duty free. This is like a endurance test. Incompetent isn't a strong enough description. After 25 minutes waiting due to some poor girl with obviously no experience I managed to get a supervisor who's first excuse was ""system problems"" which was a fairytale as she put the goods through right away. Lounge. An utter disaster of a place. Overbooked and they couldn't care less. Some Russian guy (employee!!) acting like a doorman in a sleazy nightclub outrageously deciding who could and couldn't get in. By this point I lost the plot and the only thing I was told by the lounge ""supervisor"" was that sometimes Russian people sound cheeky!!! I wasn't in Russia was in Turkey and expect even basic manners. After getting in there were numerous staff members from Fraport Technik and others enjoying coffees cigarettes and chatting but for passengers it's full????? Finally the extra security check at the gate is laughable. They do check some passengers but once boarding commences they just leave even although still about a third of the flight not even entered the gate area. All in all it's a horrendous place. Fraport should hang their heads in shame but they will never do anything about until the travelling public vote with their feet and go elsewhere unless there is a compelling need to be in AYT.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Beauvais,airport,S Hunter,9/25/2024,"Having spent far too much time of my trip to Paris looking at reviews of BVA and becoming convinced that I'd definitely miss my flight/my luggage would be pulled apart/I'd have to stand for 4-5 hours with no rest, to say I was pleasantly surprised by my airport experience would be an understatement. Beauvais is a hub for budget airlines. No one should be under any illusion that you're flying out of CDG or another mega airport in a capital city. Could the departure hall use a lick of paint? Probably. Could a few more benches be put in? Absolutely. But as a functioning airport with many flights departing at similar times, it manages the best it can. We arrived at the airport early due to all of the fear-mongering in reviews, but it allowed us to see that the airport tries its best to manage the flow of traffic. There are screens over security confirming when you'll be able to go through passport control in relation to your flight time (approx. 2.5 hours for us, in line with the bag drop opening), and from there through to the end of security, it was barely even 5 minutes until we were in duty free. As I removed my liquids and electricals in advance (as nearly all airports expect and clearly have signposted, as is the same in BVA), there were no issues with security. Duty free is admittedly sparse, but there were signs up confirming that maintenance work was ongoing. The toilets were adequate, and there was a café open for use, as well as vending and hot drinks machines. There were plug sockets (FYI - not usb ports) and, in the grand scheme of things, a fair number of benches - there are 5 departure gates, and 2 of those are in a separate area, so the space is distributed fairly. In fact, the only issues that I could see occurring were from fellow passengers themselves! People with luggage double the size of the restrictions were being asked to pay the fee at the gate, but this should not be a surprise for anyone who spends even 30 seconds looking at their boarding card information. Likewise, an outgoing flight was held, but this was due to passengers being late to the gate (the call was done in English, French and the language of the flight destination, so there really were no excuses). If people try to blame the airport for this, then they should be taking a longer look at themselves. I'm ultimately reviewing BVA for what it is; a budget friendly space to travel for those of us who don't want to break the bank.",NEUTRAL,Negative

Benghazi,airport,Peter Thackray,4/19/2010,"Flew from Tripoli to Benghazi. Extremely small airport but very speedy. Bus from aircraft to Arrivals ""Shed"" which was about 300m from the plane. A single Baggage Reclaim Belt that was open to anyone from arriving passengers to well-wishers and anyone else. No obvious security but a couple of guards. Departures domestically was a similar affair with a perfunctory scan of hand luggage and a check of Boarding Pass which then had to receive a Stamp from another person before being lead into a seating area with a small place selling drinks and snacks and toilet and Prayer Room. Boarding was females first then male passengers by bus to the plane waiting on the tarmac. Very few aircraft movements so departure was as soon as boarding was completed.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Algiers,airport,Qaddoumi Samar,5/16/2013,Algiers airport is huge and clean but I did not enjoy the business class lounge it was extremely poor compared to other countries.

Bishkek,airport,John Middleton,11/7/2012,Small functional airport. No frills. Arrived at about 3.30am from London. Not many passengers on the flight. Everything went smoothly and we were through immigration baggage and customs in no time. Once landside I realised my cell phone had fallen out of my pocket probably on the plane. A member of the BMI ground staff called the plane who found the phone and brought it to me. If arriving at Bishkek always make sure you are being collected at the airport by someone you trust and don't rely on taxis at the airport. Check in on the return trip at about 5.30 am was trouble free if a little slow on account of no online check in for my Turkish Airlines flight and painfully sluggish check in and security check staff. Travelled Business Class. Don't expect much from the BC lounge. Tired sandwiches and cake very limited choice of beverages and staff who were more interested in keeping up their conversation with each other to be bothered with the customers. Overall the airport did its job. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.,NEUTRAL,Positive

Bremen,airport,T Andrews,8/24/2017,"Bremen is a small and convenient airport, and my experience proved enjoyable. Arriving with Air France I disembarked in the main terminal. Very short walk to the baggage claim, I picked my suitcase within ten minutes. Tram line 6 frequently connects the airport with the city centre (every 6min during peak hours, 20min otherwise), travel time 10min. A one-way ticket costs €2.75, however beware that the machines accept neither credit cards nor bank notes greater than €10. Easy departure with no queue at baggage drop-in. I breezed through security, Bremen uses the full-body scanner which makes the screening process much faster. Security staff efficient and friendly. Bright departure lounge but there might not be enough seating facilities if all gates are used at the same time. Only issue: Not enough toilets facilities either landside (well hidden at the very end of the building!) or airside (one toilet block only).",POSITIVE,Neutral

If one needs to bring poles or anything similar through security, I recommend faking a limp or hope that the main jerks are on a lunch break.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Beauvais,airport,Raluca Dana Cozma,7/1/2024,"Worst airport I’ve ever been in. Worst and disrespectful staff I’ve ever met. First, after waiting in the line for the airport checkpoint, a very nice man is waiting for you. He doesn’t speak English because this airport doesn’t cover international flights and there is no need to speak English. Luckily me I speak some French to understand what he is mumbling between shouts. This man shouts at everybody because, why not, the airport is his belonging and he can act whatever he likes to. And if you don’t show him at once all the five tickets for the 5 people you are with, he will shout at you and let other people pass in front of you. After escaping the first test, you arrive at the checkpoint. Where the staff doesn’t know that if you are a diabetic and have a sensor, it’s allowed to get a bottle of water with you inside the airport. Of course, she has to put it in special tray and scan it, but she doesn’t want to do that because it’s to complicated. This is not the end and after you pass the second test, you arrive at the gate.  I don’t know who trains these people but the obviously they didn’t find out that Romania is now in Schengen Area and continue to verify each person’s ID. And after that you have to stand in line, outside the building, 30 minutes or more, no matter if it’s hot or freezing outside. And that’s it! I’ve never felt more humiliated in my entire life, I have to say that one more time. I hope I never see this airport and I don’t recommend it.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Cagliari,airport,Luca Carboni,9/23/2006,This is my home airport. Completely renewed a few years ago it's now a very good and modern airport. Near the city center (just 5 minutes by car).

No metro or train. Boarding area - once you pass Security the airport is too crowded and not having the same amenities as the pre-boarding area make the journey less comfortable. Too small for the traffic it has. Drop off/Pick Up passengers: There is a lack of enforcing the laws and people park in the drop off areas making it difficult to approach sometimes.,NEUTRAL,Positive

Brno,airport,1 reviewsS Lewis,4/10/2017,"Very small airport, on the day I was there, only 2 flights were scheduled during that day (Saturday). There is a bar and small tax free shop where you can get the usual liquor and spirits. Just 1 or 2 toilets which are rather small, but again for the amount of people using it, I do not consider it a problem. Small area to play for kids, and you just walk about 200 meters to the airplane which will be parked directly in front of the departure hall. Very convenient, quick security check and baggage drop off and it's easily accessible with both car and public transport (bus), which will depart twice every hour and will take you about 30 minutes to downtown. Wi-Fi does not work all the time but when you restart it, it will be working again.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Blackpool,airport,Paul Wharmby,9/8/2013,We travelled to Turkey on Jet2 mid-August returning early-September. We travelled from Blackpool as the holiday was some £250 cheaper than using Manchester. The car park ticket machine had run out of tickets but that didn't matter as the barriers to P2 had been broken off. We parked a good 5 minutes' walk from the terminal but it's free so I don't really see that being a problem. The terminal building is very basic and is more reminiscent of a coach station but check-in and security were both quick and easy (as was paying the ADF) and we were sitting in the bar area enjoying our first drink of the holiday while we'd still have been in the security queue at Manchester. An important point was that because we were going on a small plane to a small airport check-in at Dalaman on our return was incredibly easy drawing jealous stares from fellow travellers who were in 200-long queues. On our return to Blackpool from wheels stop through security and baggage reclaim to leaving the airport took less than 30 minutes. You absolutely cannot get better. The airport has a runway planes somewhere to sit and somewhere to get a drink. What else do you need?,POSITIVE,Neutral
Accra Kotoka,airport,B Triplett,12/13/2021,"This airport, is structurally nice and clean! That's the best part. The staff are super rude, bossy, constantly looking for someone to move or push or tell to do something irrelevant to getting people where they need to go. The instructions received are short and rude! The systems and procedures are non existing, numerous people checking and rechecked and scribbling on your ticket. I had my passport, covid, and boarding pass checked 10 times after security and sitting at the gate, it's not even possible to get to the gate without all of those having been checked?",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bangalore,airport,Dimpi Majumdar,3/12/2023,Only good thing about Bangalore airport terminal 2 is it is beautiful and clean. No other facilities available like other airports.

Amman Queen Alia,airport,J Natinski,1/1/2024,"It was by far the worst airport experience I've ever had. The airport security personnel were incredibly rude and treated passengers with utter disrespect. They thoroughly searched through all of my belongings, including my medically prescribed medications, without any consideration for privacy or common courtesy. What shocked me the most was the length of time the security check took. Despite there not being a large number of people in line, the process took well over an hour, causing me to almost miss my flight. The airport was unprofessional and dirty. The facilities were poorly maintained, and the overall atmosphere was one of chaos and disorganization. It's clear that the staff are in need of proper training in customer service and basic hygiene practices. I would strongly advise anyone considering traveling through Amman International Airport to find an alternative route. The treatment and conditions at this airport are unacceptable, and I would never subject myself to such mistreatment and unhygienic conditions again.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bandung,airport,Imran Ahmad,1/7/2020,"I was quite shocked by the lack of immigration checks and also the crowd at the airport. It was a hassle to retrieve our luggage as there was only one baggage track at arrival.

At the end, our flight was boarding and they were allowing people to jump in front of us. Finally had to push our luggage in front of others to get them to stop putting others before is.

Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,2 reviewsE Carmere,3/14/2024,"It was a very unpleasant experience at Bridgetown airport, while arrival was still acceptable the departure was a nightmare. The counters for check in are opening later as the announced time on the tickets, very long queue for security and no fast track however it seemed passengers from a particular cruise line with some 99% passengers from the UK did obtain priority. Officers doing the security were extremely unpolite and very disrespectful, shouting to passengers as a drill sergeant to recruits - give them a uniform and they all think they are important . Restrooms not clean at all, boarding the plane was chaotic.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Akron–Canton,airport,2 reviewsJoseph Leonetti,1/1/2022,"Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",POSITIVE,Neutral

Security metal detector doesn't work they just pat down everybody coming through. After security, not much food places on one end can get busy in the departure area. Boarding was a mess no queuing system for two flights with desks close together so people kept getting into the wrong queue. Fine airport for a short time.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Bordeaux,airport,Frederic Guyot,12/14/2024,"Bordeaux Airport is arguably one of the least impressive airports in Europe. The overall experience can be quite unpleasant, especially for those traveling on business. Customs lines are painfully slow, and the officers can be quite unfriendly. Learning a few basic English phrases would certainly help, particularly since Bordeaux promotes itself as an international destination. Despite its relatively decent size, there are no adequate business lounges, and the ""zone Affaire"" is frequently closed.  There are two internet options available, but neither seems to work reliably. Once you've cleared security, good luck finding amenities; there’s virtually nothing beyond the small boarding gates. Currently, my flight is delayed by two hours, and I can't help but wish I could return to the city instead of wasting my time here. To the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce: please take action to improve this situation!",NEGATIVE,Positive

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,9/8/2011,Bob Hope Airport as it is formally known is small and easy to navigate. Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus. You can also take one of the parking shuttles to the nearby Metrolink/Amtrak rail station.,POSITIVE,Neutral

When i had cleared baggage, body and passport check I went to the lounge, to realise to my horror that I hadn't got my belt from the body check. I spent minutes contemplating how I was shortly destined to be walking round London with my trousers falling down because I didn't have my belt on. As we were summoned to the gate I was overjoyed to hear an announcement from Bergerac Airport or Ryanair saying that my belt had been found. I am so happy, I feel moved to thank, and complement whichever staff or system meant that I was reunited with my belt. Well done.",POSITIVE,Negative
Aberdeen,airport,Raneide Wilkins,1/13/2024,"My review of Aberdeen Airport is regarding the lack of options when it comes to travel. Not many options and not many airlines offering any destination from Aberdeen, This airport has been upgraded and I still don't see why, if no extra destinations have been added for travelers. Aberdeen has become one of the poorest Scotland destinations on so many levels. I am local and used to travel loads but not anymore as the flight option has declined over the years. Another big problem in Aberdeen and Aberdeen airport is the lack of taxis and the extortionate car parking charges.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Peter Cullen,9/24/2008,I used Tempelhof for the first (and I guess last) time last week. It is wonderful - why are modern airports not like this? The history and architecture are fabulous of course but it also works incredibly well - admittedly having so few flights means nothing is really under pressure. As noted elsewhere public transport links are excellent one can be in the city centre within 15 minutes of walking off the plane. From the departure lounge to seat on the aircraft takes less than a minute. I guess it is an anachronism in the 21st century but it is sad to say goodbye to an airport with real character.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Amman Queen Alia,airport,T Hilderbrandt,11/21/2024,"Terribly disorganized airport. Signage is horrible for international transfers. Had to go through security 3 times. E.g., bought some overpriced water by the boarding gate. Then they ordered all passengers out to go through security and then they took my water away. At security, they pulled my bag apart, then just stuffed things in randomly. I had to repack the whole thing. Few staff speak any English and they are rude.

Bratislava,airport,P Anderson,12/16/2018,I have witnessed a steady decline in this Airport. Although the building is fairly new and it is relatively clean the attitude of the staff is awful. So many of them are uninterested and dare I say it arrogant. I actually get the impression they have such a massive distain for the passengers its quite disturbing! So you have a nice terminal filled with people who obviously hate their jobs so much it seems to be like some kind of torture!

Abuja,airport,C Stafford,1/31/2010,Upon arrival from Amsterdam on KLM I went to use the bathroom and there was no garbage can and no toilet paper. The airport was cleaner than I expected. I think it's better than Lagos actually. Our luggage failed to arrive with us and we were told to come back in 3 days time to pick it up! We weren't going to be anywhere near Abuja in 3 days! We were told later by the airline (after we got back to the US) that they should have delivered it to us. (It was a 6 hour drive one way by the way.) Leaving was a nightmare. They had no record of our changed flight days and had no way of checking with our credit card (we were told that's all we would need to verify our changed dates-a credit card.) We were told to step aside while they helped other passengers. Then we were sent to one person who told us to go to another person etc etc. It took two hours to straighten out the mess and that was only because my husband had to beg the woman to let him use her computer so he could check his email which he was sure would have a confirmation of the change. I will say this particular woman was very professional and willing to do whatever it took to help us. Boarding passes were hand-written. Upon checking our baggage the woman typed in LIM instead of ILM which meant our bags were heading for Lima Peru not Wilmington North Carolina! This screw-up was revealed to us upon arriving in Atlanta. Overall not a good experience with the airport or maybe it was just KLM/Delta. Who knows. I was not impressed.,NEGATIVE,Neutral

Bandung,airport,Henri Bemelmans,5/20/2018,The new airport is much better than the old but the issue with taxis remains. The military controls the airport and hence which taxis are used. No meters and extortionate fares. Better off walking 5 minutes south on road outside arrivals (right angle to airport terminal) and pickup a bluebird or AA cab from there. Clean and metered. Pity the Government does not stop in and do something about this as it is a horrible welcome to what is otherwise a friendly and interesting city and region.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE,Negative
Asturias,airport,Martyn Davies,3/15/2006,Nice clean provincial airport handy for Asturias Cantabria and Galicia. The check-in hall is spacious and on the occasions I've used it it has always been hassle-free. The cafe is large and reasonably priced and the toilets clean. There are a half dozen care hire booths in the airport. I always use the bus to get into and out of Oviedo. It is cheap (@5 euros single) and runs regularly from the stop outside the arrivals hall. Regular buses also run to Gijon and Aviles. There are plentiful taxis if you want a more expensive drive in. The only mild criticism I have of the airport is the time it takes to get through customs on arrival. Other than that a pleasant airport which nearly makes flying pleasurable.,POSITIVE,Neutral

Ballina Byron,airport,C Tudehope,7/15/2010,For the number of passengers it handles the Ballina-Byron airport really isn't that big. For most of the day it's fairly quiet with REX operating its 36 seaters 3 times per day. However within a 2 hour timeframe both Virgin and Jetstar operate their 180-seaters into and out of the airport which causes it to almost reach breaking point. The departure lounge isn't in any way big enough to cater for a full flight and the ventilation leaves a bit to be desired. The ground crew from all airlines were friendly enough and the cafe wasn't too bad. However when comparing Ballina the second largest market out of Sydney to other regional airports like Albury Dubbo Newcastle and Canberra it really is sub-par. It needs freshening up made more open and indeed made bigger to cater for any future growth that may come about! It gets the job done-but it's nothing special-and definitely isn't inviting.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Bergen,airport,Peter Thackray,12/13/2016,"A relatively small but busy airport serving a key city on the coast of Norway. Most flights are domestic within Norway.

Upstairs to Security and Departures. The main domestic departures has a few food outlets, a book shop and a convenience shop, there is a further section for International Travellers with full Duty Free options. Most planes land at a gate with pier so little need to be outside. No announcements or ""Last Calls"" are made so you need to look at one of the many monitors to check your flight status.

Baggage claim experience was smooth. Taxi was readily available outside for transportation to hotel. While returning back, I had a very smooth check-in and security experience.

In my point of view, the only downside is the limited Internet and when you have not enough money to spend for food. I'm also glad that the playroom at the bottom of their huge, central LED screen is free for everyone to enjoy and wheelchair accessible as well which is absolutely a big plus. Also, the airport didn't seem too crowded and I hope it stays that way.",POSITIVE,Neutral

When I finally cleared the initial security screening and checked in for my flight I commenced queuing once more the queue which was very slow became absolutely chaotic when people entered the queue from the sides and no airport staff or security staff intervened. The entire experience showed a level of inability in the security or airport staff to ensure orderly queuing and safety of passengers.

Billund,airport,M Cooper,2/19/2020,"Kind, friendly staff! I was due to travel back to Frankfurt on 9th February when Storm Ciara/Sabine hit Northern and Central Europe. My Lufthansa flight was cancelled before I left for the airport and I was rebooked via text message onto two SAS flights - Billund-Oslo then Oslo-Frankfurt the next day. Unfortunately, after 3/4 hour at the gate on the Monday, my SAS flight was cancelled for technical reasons. There was no SAS rep at the airport so we all had to call their call centre to rebook our flights. I was pretty frustrated but an SAS employee at the call centre was friendly enough when I got through and told me my flight had already been rebooked, though I hadn't had a text message or mail at that time. The Billund airport staff I spoke to couldn't have been friendlier and more helpful. Their hands were tied as they weren't responsible for rebooking our flights but they went out of their way to guide me and fellow passengers. I had had no info from the airline about the chance of booking a hotel/meal vouchers etc. but one kind airport employee took it into his own hands and sorted it all out for me, booking a room and printing a voucher (which they could clearly then redeem from SAS). In short, not much more than an hour after the flight cancellation announcement, I was in an airport hotel room and had time to have dinner and relax before flying the next morning (which all happily worked out). I often fly to and from Billund airport and it's one of my favourites - comfortable, good design, good shops, cafes and restaurants, plenty of seating, perfect view of the runway, etc. Since that day, I've added friendly staff to my list of positives.",POSITIVE,Neutral

Bermuda,airport,Andy Magowan,5/29/2016,"Arrival. What can I say? This airport is small. I arrived on a Monday evening on a BA 777. Also just arrived was an AA 737. The arrival hall is small, very small. Add to this there were only three immigration desks open. I think the wait was around an hour. Add to that the distinct lack of seating. It was a chore. The surroundings were pleasant enough, but standing for an hour with nothing to do but shuffle forward at the pace of a one legged gnat, was nothing less than a chore. Departure. My transfer to BDA got me there at around a quarter past 6am. Unfortunately the check in desks don't open until around 7am, but at least there was seating. Lines were short and once check in opened I was able to get through check in and clear U.S customs in around 15 minutes. The departure lounge has a couple of reasonably priced eateries and a pretty spacious seating area with wifi and mobile/tablet charging stations. There was also a nice floor to ceiling windowed area at one end with a good view of the apron and runway.

Blackpool,airport,Peter Walker,7/3/2013,The poor lighting inside makes it look as if you have just walked into a fairground dark ride. The gents toilet (singular you'll notice) always smells of something unpleasant. The advertising blurb tells of facilities that are never open and it has a help desk that is manned only when the staff feel like it which is as good as never. It looks like an uncompleted job on which the builders have walked off because the service pipes are all exposed and there is not so much as a false ceiling to hide it all. It has been like this for decades. To then ask the public to pay £10 each to refurbish something that should be done out of the operating profits over many years is a disgrace. Forget expecting to see a terminal akin to those airy ones with glass and steel as at `proper` airports this is a chicken-shed inspired windowless dark oblong box. You are unable to see any aircraft from inside or outside so plane spotters stay away.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Bandung,airport,Imran Ahmad,1/7/2020,"I was quite shocked by the lack of immigration checks and also the crowd at the airport. It was a hassle to retrieve our luggage as there was only one baggage track at arrival. There is also a lack of shopping choices and amenities airside but the items were so expensive, more than twice the price in Malaysia or other places even though the rupiah is cheaper than ringgit. But I'm pleased with the fast internet connection and the free computer services.",POSITIVE,Neutral
Boise,airport,R Dunford,5/31/2009,Pleasant enough airport small yet not crowded enough for it to be oppressive. Free internet for your laptop throughout the terminal is good (take note Seattle Dulles and O'Hare).

Budapest Ferihegy,airport,C Lamedes,8/27/2024,"The facilities are quite good, there are many eating options, cafés, etc. The airport has been recently extended and nicely renovated. However, the attitude of the staff does not always meet the expectations set by the airport itself, mainly regarding the staff at the boarding gates. Some of them are merely there to check the size of the hand bags (several people for one gate) and are not helpful at all. In some cases they don’t speak English. I’ve also experienced rude and condescending attitude towards me while not even addressing me directly, which was humiliating. As a customer, this is not the treatment one would expect. I’ve also seen the same towards other passengers in several occasions, so it is important to take this into account, but I hope they will be able to improve and give more importance to kindness in order to make the experience pleasant for everyone.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Beijing Daxing,airport,6 reviewsSun Xiaoou,2/5/2021,"The traffic of Beijing Daxing airport is very convenient. You can get there by high-speed rail. The design of Daxing airport is very grand and novel. There are many self-service check-in machines in Daxing airport. There are many open windows at the manual check-in place, and the queuing time is short. The efficiency of security inspection is high, but there are few open channels, which leads to a long queue time. After passing the security check, there are many restaurants in it, and the price is the same as that in the urban area. The departure and arrival of Daxing airport are mixed. There are many turntables at the baggage claim area, and the waiting time is very short. It's just that the airport guidelines need to be improved. I was a little confused when I went to Daxing airport for the first time. Airport WiFi is fast and supports takeout at the gate.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Altenburg,airport,R Heelas,10/13/2008,As with many small airports travelling to and from Altenburg is a pleasure. The terminal is about as big as a Drive-Through burger restaurant and there is free parking within 30m of the building. This airport is an excellent option for passengers travelling to or from the southern part of the former East Germany or to the north of Bavaria (I live in Bamberg and the drive is much shorter and more pleasant than to the next nearest Ryanair airport at Frankfurt Hahn). On the downside if you arrive early the Duty Free shop is very small and the restaurant is basic but the staff are friendly.,POSITIVE,Negative
Akron–Canton,airport,2 reviewsJoseph Leonetti,1/1/2022,"Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",POSITIVE,Negative
Aspen Pitkin County,airport,B Frank,4/18/2020,"We were returning back home to Virginia via ORD and our ASE to ORD flight got cancelled. The main lobby and check-in/ticketing area of Aspen Airport does not have a vending machine for even water. TSA did not allow already checked-in passengers to go through security and wait in the gates section due to some ""safety"" issue due to overcrowding in the gates area. We had to wait five hours. Twice I went to the bathroom and through a windowed door you could see the gate area with FEW people while the front of the airport building was overcrowded with unhappy and angry passengers. I already sent my complaint to American Airlines. This issue of no water, soda or food for hours is not acceptable in todays world. For sure I have no desire to visit Aspen due to this awful airport and airline experience.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,J Segal,1/30/2008,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE,Negative
Ayers Rock,airport,Xuess Wee,12/27/2003,A small airport serving only 1 main highlight in the Red Centre of Australia - the tourist attraction of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. I arrived by domestic service (I understood some international flights do use this airport) so customs were negligible. The airport is built on the edge of the desert and is surrounded by picturesque desert panorama. Being tourist orientated all sorts of tourist services were available immediately upon retrieval of baggage. A free tourist bus is available for pick up for everyone staying at the huge monopoly of Ayers Rock Resort about 20 minutes away from the airport which unless you are a local that's where you will be.,NEUTRAL,Negative

It’s not like flights arrive randomly. These are international scheduled flights, and they have amble ability to plan to resource.

Bremen,airport,3 reviewsAndrew Coogans,6/28/2015,"Flew in and out of the dedicated Ryanair terminal (Terminal E) at Bremen Airport, but also spent some time in the other main terminal complex. Upon arrival, the Immigration desks were efficient, but the queuing area seemed to be slightly small for a full Boeing 737-800, and indeed there was a small area outside to accommodate a queue. The terminal seems to be a converted hangar, and serves its purpose well. Baggage collection time was fine. Amazingly close tram stop outside, along with office blocks and hotels. It feels like the airport is simply another building in the middle of the city. The tram is a very convenient and cheap way into the city centre. On departure, we walked through the main terminal to get to Terminal E. It appeared very spacious and quiet. There appeared to be adequate check in desks for the flights that were operating and the whole place seemed very tranquil. Terminal E itself was busy. About a 10 minute wait at Security and then the gate area seemed very crowded, particularly for the non-Schengen area flights, of which there were 2 departing within 5 minutes of each other. Still, I was impressed with this airport and would have no issues about using it again.",POSITIVE,Negative

Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Patricia Merlo,1/2/2024,"It is astonishing that Barbados Grantley Airport is still as unfriendly and disorganised as other reviewers described it years ago. Although we were in transit, we had to have all our belongings scanned again by customs and this was done incredibly slowly and with unfriendly, harsh orders from the officials. The most amazing thing was that they shouted at us because some of us were carrying rum in sealed bags from Grenada Duty Free. They treated the people concerned as if they were serious criminals. The bags were confiscated. The people concerned asked what would happen to them now. We were told that we would get them back at the gate. At the gate, the staff knew nothing about it. They just shrugged their shoulders and kept the passengers waiting for about half an hour. Then an employee set off, slow as a snail, and finally came back with 3 bags. He crawled off again and brought a few more bags. Everyone got on the plane, even those who hadn't got their bags back. The crew finally took care of the matter and the rest were brought onto the plane. The passengers were accused by the airport staff of not having listened. However, we were still unable to take off as the airport's passenger system suddenly went on strike and several officials had to go through the aircraft to count us several times. After an hour's delay, we saw Barbados getting smaller under the aircraft. I will definitely not be returning to this inhospitable airport, no way!",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Giovanni Guidi,6/2/2006,Very badly located and designed airport. The check-in areas are outside (it doesn't rain but it can be very hot) the airport is too far away from the city (no fast connections as well). In terms of services it has banks restaurants newsagents cash machines and a post office. There is no internet access for passengers which is ridiculous for the third biggest airport in Brazil. I had to send an urgent business email and had to beg the local administration office (on the top floor of the terminal) to use one of their computers for 5 minutes. Thanks to the good nature of most of the Brazilian people this was allowed (saving me from a lot of problems) but if the management is willing to put mobile phones rechargers in the terminal (I could see they were available for everyone for free) they could also make the effort to put a couple of internet access points.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Brindisi,airport,Antonio Jorio,2/22/2016,"I use the airport of Brindisi quite often and among the years several improvements have been made to the terminal area. It is now clean, with several shops and bars. Toilets are available in the departure and arrival areas. The security check may be a little bit complicated because the area is a bit small. Once passed the gate area offers enough space and a bar to wait your boarding time. The only issue which needs to be resolved soon is related to the car parkings. There are now several flights and in fact Brindisi airport carried 2.200 Mln pax in 2015. It is mandatory to build up a multi story car park close to the terminal. Overall judgement of the airport is widely positive.",POSITIVE,Negative
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Andre Bomtempo,6/30/2006,The new Highway (Linha Verde) connecting the Airport to Downtown Belo Horizonte will definitely help with the distance issue. The Airport itself is modern and well maintained. But I think it has potential that’s not being used. The lack of international flights is another problem. Most flights have connections in Rio or SP making BH hours farther then it really is. It could take less than 10 hours from New York but with the connections it takes about 15 hours if we are lucky enough to find a flight from Rio or SP. Hopefully with the “Industrial Airport” more international flights will start to be available we’ll see.,NEUTRAL,Negative

Banjul,airport,Val Theobalds,8/28/2021,"Getting through the departure area at Banjul airport The Gambia to get to the UK is beyond ridiculous. 1) Firstly when you arrive to the airport you have to queue and weigh your luggage outside of the airport on scales. 2) You then proceed to pay 1000GMD PP departure tax about £16 at another area 3) You are then shown to the first check in point where you need to show the following, Covid test vaccination proof for the UK. Evidence that a day 2 test has been booked in the UK. We had to challenge the staff here as they were stating that a day 8 was needed as well. Not if you are doubled jabbed. Covid test result in The Gambia Passenger locator form for the UK. PP 4) Luggage drop - the conveyor belt does not work. So you weigh your luggage and take them off to place them back onto the luggage trolley. Air Brussels are strict with weight and do not give you an inch. Your hand luggage is also weighed at this point. 5) Passengers proceed to bag security where the luggage is scanned, checked and can be opened (so have your keys ready) The bags are then weighed again. Once this is done the bags are taken by a man to be placed in holding. 6) Next stop - The passenger locator form for Brussels then needs to be shown at another desk. 7) Travellers then need to proceed to immigration, where eye scans, a further PP check is done and finger prints are taken 8) Another security check again for hand luggage which is scanned and your PP is checked again. 9) The final check is done before you board the plane and access the bus. Covid test result - despite being shown already Standard PP check boarding pass Hand luggage is weighed again Boarding pass for connecting flights need to be shown as well. I would suggest leaving early to get to the airport. I would also suggest that you eat inside the airport at the restaurant to the top right. The restaurant past the final check point is limited and more expensive too. You are also attacked by flies whilst eating. There is no duty free shopping either.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Beauvais,airport,S Hunter,9/25/2024,"Having spent far too much time of my trip to Paris looking at reviews of BVA and becoming convinced that I'd definitely miss my flight/my luggage would be pulled apart/I'd have to stand for 4-5 hours with no rest, to say I was pleasantly surprised by my airport experience would be an understatement. Beauvais is a hub for budget airlines. No one should be under any illusion that you're flying out of CDG or another mega airport in a capital city. Could the departure hall use a lick of paint? Probably. Could a few more benches be put in? Absolutely. But as a functioning airport with many flights departing at similar times, it manages the best it can. We arrived at the airport early due to all of the fear-mongering in reviews, but it allowed us to see that the airport tries its best to manage the flow of traffic. There are screens over security confirming when you'll be able to go through passport control in relation to your flight time (approx. 2.5 hours for us, in line with the bag drop opening), and from there through to the end of security, it was barely even 5 minutes until we were in duty free. As I removed my liquids and electricals in advance (as nearly all airports expect and clearly have signposted, as is the same in BVA), there were no issues with security. Duty free is admittedly sparse, but there were signs up confirming that maintenance work was ongoing. The toilets were adequate, and there was a café open for use, as well as vending and hot drinks machines. There were plug sockets (FYI - not usb ports) and, in the grand scheme of things, a fair number of benches - there are 5 departure gates, and 2 of those are in a separate area, so the space is distributed fairly. In fact, the only issues that I could see occurring were from fellow passengers themselves! People with luggage double the size of the restrictions were being asked to pay the fee at the gate, but this should not be a surprise for anyone who spends even 30 seconds looking at their boarding card information. Likewise, an outgoing flight was held, but this was due to passengers being late to the gate (the call was done in English, French and the language of the flight destination, so there really were no excuses). If people try to blame the airport for this, then they should be taking a longer look at themselves. I'm ultimately reviewing BVA for what it is; a budget friendly space to travel for those of us who don't want to break the bank.",NEUTRAL,Negative

I had to wait for a staff, unfortunately, but she was incredibly helpful, calm and smiling. Their security staff may seem a little stiff, this day was not busy, but they still did not have the profits for a smile. However, they must be praised for being very quick to get guests through. This airport had a passenger record a few years ago, with 3 million passengers annually, therefore, they chose to expand the airport. But instead of giving passengers the more space they deserve, they chose instead to expand their very fine lounge, which is never filled, as well as the office for the staff - a disgrace to people who travel a lot. The design of the airport is great even though it is old. as mentioned, the staff are some of the friendliest staff and they are the reason why I love coming here.

Ashgabat,airport,S King,6/30/2019,"Ashgabat is a big airport with very limited traffic. Arrived very early in the morning and had to queue at the visa desk which took just on two hours. If you don't have a visa prior to arrival you can get one at the airport, the process is quite long and takes a lot of time. First you queue in the visa line and hand over document and passport. Then you queue at the cash desk which can take a lot of time to hand over the money and the tourist tax (which everyone has to pay so this line is the busiest), once done with that back to the visa desk to get the documents back (the cashier desk only accept USD some people had euros which caused some delays. They have to be post 2003 clean and crisp otherwise they won't accept it). They have fingerprint scanners which sometimes work or not. Then immigration which the guy was lovely and was very welcoming, one of the best immigration experiences I have had in a while. Your passport gets checked again before going down the escalator which has an amazing green hand rail. Luggage was waiting for me then go through customs and have passport checked again to leave.

Blantyre,airport,Wilbert Wolfs,2/2/2009,Arriving at Blantyre's Chileka airport is a colonial experience. Arriving from Johannesburg the airplane is taxied in front of the arrival hall. School classes have already been run out to see the big bird landing. The building has a wooden veranda and there is a special area were people are expected to cheer after the president has landed. The first time I arrived at Chileka the luggage was simply dropped on the tarmac. The passengers had to fight to get their possessions. Of course quite some passengers did not find any luggage at all as it had stayed behind in Jo'burg. Immigration is quite impressive with a lot of stamps in passports and on listings. To get out you have to go through a door then you turn sharply turn left and right. Again left until you bump into the departing passengers and their luggage. Since half a year we have a new arrival hall at our airport.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Albury,airport,C Tudehope,4/18/2010,It's a gorgeous little country airport. The terminal only opened last October and it still has a new smell. There are no queues anywhere and in general all ground staff are friendly and laid back. There is no need to allow excess time because there will be no queues at checkin or at security-the largest planes into the airport only seat 78 people-and they aren't always full. There are lovely large windows with views over the tarmac runway and ranges in the distance (and if it's race day you can see the horses too). The cafe is good although a bit overpriced. It's interesting that whilst Virgin and Qantas passengers have to go through security Rex and Brindabella passengers don't. There are no issues to speak of in this small yet very pleasant airport.,POSITIVE,Neutral

Limited baggage handlers so for a full charter flight might be longer. About 25 mins from landing to getting in the taxi. Going out the departure hall has been rebuilt much better and quicker. Security still tight big queue to get through. The departure lounge has been rebuilt and access to the rooftop terrace removed. The lounge is much better than the original. As work is going on don't know if there are plans to restore access to the roof. Small snack bar with coffee and rolls at reasonable prices but duty free for local stuff is the same price as supermarkets and imported stuff is more expensive than UK supermarket prices. Wouldn't want to arrive or depart when there are more than 2 charter/scheduled UK flights though. Then it would get overloaded very quickly.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Christian Seefeldt,10/30/2003,Easy to get there - free parking just in front of it - super fast check in and so on.

Billund,airport,Claus Nielsen,2/19/2009,My favourite airport. Fast efficient and very pleasant. Easy to get to easy to navigate check-in and security is always fast and friendly and the lounge above Security is great. Extremely roomy and classy great for work or relaxation even offers open smoker's cabins that don't feel like a cage - and a chess game for those with plenty of time. Almost everywhere in the airport can you overlook the runway and the whole place is just modern roomy and open. The airport size is an advantage without doubt - the distances between parking check-in security lounge gate and flight are minimal so getting in and out is always a pleasure. Much better than Copenhagen in almost all aspects.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Accra Kotoka,airport,M Addo,6/4/2022,"Corruption Central. Its funny that Kotoko airport has an announcement stating that it doesn't condone the extortion of customers, however does not provide any means of complaints and its scary to complain to the members of staff as they may also try to extort you. Got stopped by the security at the exit on my arrival wanting to know what was in my bag and after finding out there was nothing of worthwhile value they then asked if I could ""bless a brother"". On my return, then got stopped for another ""blessing"" by an immigration officer. Honestly, for such a beautiful airport it downgrades the whole airport and does not send out an inviting message.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Belem,airport,S Koenig,9/20/2009,Small for a supposedly international airport but the only international flights I saw listed were to Suriname.

Taxis appeared to be plentiful.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Bergerac,airport,Richard Lindsay,6/24/2013,This airport is small so whilst access is good facilities are very limited.

Beijing Capital,airport,S Valderi,6/6/2024,"I can't help but being disappointed at my experience with Terminal 3 at Beijing Airport. I had two transits there, on the way to and back from Japan, once in the early morning (5am), and once in the evening (7pm). The terminal is large, pleasant to move around, and quite clean. Water is free, in paper cups, which isn't always the same. The negatives are many, so I'll start with a big one: the wifi is awful. An absurd number of websites are blocked, this being China, but even those feel random. Youtube is a no-go, but Whatsapp works fine. Instagram worked for my girlfriend, but not for me. Twitter worked on the first transit, but not the second. This might seem minor, but the anoyance accumulates when you're left with nothing at all to do in an empty terminal. Because it is empty: food and shops option are severely limited, with only one restaurant and one perfume shop being open when we were there, even though it wasn't too late or early. I was looking forward to buying a magazine in Chinese since I'm studying it, but those were nowhere to be found. Food itself is fine, but comes with a caveat, the severe lack of meat-free options. My girlfriend is piscitarian, but even so we found all noodle dishes and sandwiches had meat, you'll just have to make do. Going around the terminal you'll notice a severe lack of plugs, which are stingily doted out 2 at a time at specific spots. Inexplicably, at the end of the terminal a small decorated area has abundant plugs and armchairs to rest, at odds with the rest of the place, almost to reward those intrepid enough to drag their luggage so far away from everything else. The above had left a pretty mediocre impression on my first transit, but on our return it got worse, as we had to interact with staff and services. We had a 7 hour layover, so we were planning on using a lounge to rest. No such luck. We were not entitled to Air China's Business and First Class lounges, so we went to the Transit Lounge. There the staff spoke hardly any English, ""you had to book"", which was comical on several fronts. First of all, the whole airport was empty, secondly Air China's website did not say booking was mandatory. The website booking also didn't work. The (very expensive) hourly hotel? ""Full, full, all full"". It gave a strong impression that staff just couldn't be bothered to have English guests. Near the fountain a sign read ""paid lounge"", so we took an elevator down there. The stinky and mostly empty lounge sat brightly lit, but staff was seemingly unaware of the sign outside, and spoke even less English. We then decided to ask the information desk, which unhelpfully, and again with very limited English, sent us to the aforementioned lounges. ""No idea"" why they wouldn't offer paid services. A brief note on the use of English, as I don't want to sound entitled. I have studied Chinese, so I could have attempted a conversation, but after a long flight, and ahead of a transit I was quite tired. Plus, with the broken wifi, the dictionary was not available. I think it's quite normal in a space specifically designed to accomodate international travellers to account for English being spoken. Even ignoring that, and trying to use the giant tablet with map information, it's all in Chinese. It seems a sign of general disinterest that little to no effort is made to have English options, which surely is detrimental not just to travellers, but to staff.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Agadir,airport,Paul Styles,2/16/2009,To get in from the street you must undergo luggage scan first as there's no entry hall. To get out onto the tarmac and into your plane note well that there's no queue space (the departure lounge seats are right by the exit gate doors). Our flight was announced at gate N°6 (there are only 6 gates) but after 5 minutes delay moved to gate 4 then to gate 2 for 150 people with much luggage for a flight with first come first served seats. The hostesses tried to get people to form 2 queue lines in vain so embarkation was a free for all. Shocking treatment for an international airport. Aside from that the setting is very pleasant.,NEUTRAL,Negative

Bags arrived in a couple more minutes and we were out and looking for the car rental desk. On return, there were no queues and at security we did not have to take anything out of our bags. Our flex-economy ticket gave us access to the Aspire lounge which was very quiet but well stocked with food and beverages.

Would use this airport again.",POSITIVE,Neutral

The problem with Bishkek is it takes a good 30 minutes to get though the security check as there is only one scanner. Once through though, there is a smoking area, several shops and a small bar, but you won't get much time to avail of these facilities! The departure screens don't seem to work, and when it is time to board, an airport staff member simply shouts the destination of the flight.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Rude passport control officer. Extremely rude customs officer - she pawed through all my belongings being careful to disarrange them untidily. Then to the greeting area - no chairs to sit in while awaiting my pickup. Entire area filthy. By now I needed a bathroom a janitor directed me to one ""around the corner"" near a loading dock. It smelt of urine and was crawling with ants. Departure: confusing signage shops too few and overpriced at gate (upper level) one goes down a flight of stairs in order to go up a flight of stairs into the airplane.

Agadir,airport,Kevin Maslin,8/11/2008,No major problems here. Lots of check-in desks open at inbound passport control so we were processed fairly quickly and directed to the transfer coach within 20 mins. Lots of 'porters' in brown uniform with trolleys offered to take our luggage when we disembarked from the coach on the return journey. We could manage ok but I think they were asking for 10 Dirham (about 70p) to take you all the way to check-in which I considered to be fairly reasonable. We were told that we could not spend our left over Dirhams in the departure lounge so we changed them at the bank (not for sterling but to euros!) in the lobby prior to joining the queue for the scanning machine. As there was only one channel in operation it took quite a while to get through and then we discovered that the shops would accept sterling euros or dirhams! Ho-hum. We had taken our own drinks through as we had been told the airport prices were shockingly expensive (even the so-called duty-free!) but we did buy 3 Snickers bars at 4.5 euros! We were not aware that our flight was overdue by half an hour as announcements were largely in French fairly inaudible and the screens were not very informative. Once the gate was open though we were ushered through to the plane quite quickly.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Beijing Capital,airport,1 reviewsIvan Chumakov,4/22/2024,"I was transiting with Air China in Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3. Most international flights operate from Concourse T3E, but some use T3D. In my cause both arrival and departure were from T3E. On transit passengers need to go through document and security and customs check. The walking times are not really long and mostly travelators are available. There are 2 transfer service checkpoints, one from each side of the concourse. The crowd is not really well organized and staff is not really helpful. Not everyone speaks English, which is quite frustrating, when you actually need to communicate with airport or security staff. Arriving early in the morning, get ready to spend 1h queuing for transit. Other than that, I have to note that Terminal 3 is very modern by its looks and layout. The ceiling is high, which makes it seam like the airport is free and spacious. Walking distances are not too long. Most gates are accessible in less than 10 minutes of calm stroll. Between T3E, T3D and T3C there is an automated people mover (train), which is easily accessible after security. I didn't use it, but I located its station and observed it a little. There are few restaurants, which in my opinion are quite reasonable priced. Early in the morning only few Chinese restaurants and Western cafes were opened. The food is actually quite delicious. I would note good availability of seating spaces. Some are equipped with universal power outlets and USB chargers. If you want to use Wi-Fi, better use Wi-Fi kiosks as SMS sometimes doesn't go through. Be aware that you won't be able to use most messengers and social networks. Also it was nice to have drinking fountains within short reach from most seating areas. I would suggest considering Beijing Capital Airport as transit hub for Asia. Clean and modern airport with all the necessary facilities for longer transits.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

There are moving walkways but it nonetheless took a while. Then a long wait for baggage. My main gripe, though, and a cautionary note: my Swiss army knife was confiscated at the train station. Carefully packed in checked baggage, never in carry-on, so no problem for the flight. But getting in to the ticket hall for the train to Beijing baggage is inspected and my knife was not allowed.

Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Andre Bomtempo,6/30/2006,The new Highway (Linha Verde) connecting the Airport to Downtown Belo Horizonte will definitely help with the distance issue. The Airport itself is modern and well maintained. But I think it has potential that’s not being used. The lack of international flights is another problem. Most flights have connections in Rio or SP making BH hours farther then it really is. It could take less than 10 hours from New York but with the connections it takes about 15 hours if we are lucky enough to find a flight from Rio or SP. Hopefully with the “Industrial Airport” more international flights will start to be available we’ll see.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Accra Kotoka,airport,Klaus Malling Olsen,3/7/2016,"During rush-hours (evening) Kotoka Airport felt very crowded, but check-in was surprising quick, as well as security check, this works well if you arrive at least 3 hours before departure. Rush hours here mean departure within half an hour for several wide-body plans, creating a severe lack of seating and extremely long rows of slowly boarding passengers, making you realize that you are in a far too small airport to handle several aircrafts with a capacity of 3-400 passengers within a short time limit. Thi is especially the case when you arrive. The rows of arriving passengers at the immigration was long enough to last for almost one hour, and was followed by usual slow deliverance of luggage. Furthermore, the staff controlling the yellow cards for vaccinations are not very well inset in the rules, including the knowledge that persons over a certain age are not required vaccination against yellow fever. However, as a whole Kotoka was not too bad an experience, just accept some more time than required in more updated and modern airports.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Ayers Rock,airport,J Teale,9/6/2024,"I was recently on a return flight from Uluru after four days at Sails in the Desert celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary. I am unable to proceed through regular screening as I have a cardiac loop recorder implanted in my left breast and have had a total right hip replacement. I indicated this when asked as I loaded my cabin luggage on the conveyor belt and was directed to the alternative screening process. I was screened with the usual procedure, then pat down. That’s expected. I could see my implant & prosthesis clearly on the screen. Then the young lady asked me to rub both hands back & forward in my groin - no idea why at this stage. Then my hands were scanned with a detector. “None detected” was the result on screen. It then occurred to me that I am being screened for secreting drugs in my private parts. The young lady then advises me that I need to proceed to a room for a personal body search. I must have looked quite incredulous as a senior officer came, pointed to the screen and advised the young lady that it was indeed a hip prosthesis and allowed me to proceed. I’m still traumatised and flabbergasted at such poor training. With 230,000 annual visitors to Uluru I find it beyond belief that this young lady has never seen what a hip replacement looks like on screen. My orthopaedic surgeon provided me with a certificate of proof of hip replacement but assured me that it wasn’t necessary for me to carry this when travelling due to the high numbers of passengers with hip and knee replacements and airport staff are very familiar with these prostheses. Needless to say that that experience certainly took away from the anniversary celebrations. Jetstar’s “complaints” procedure are so cumbersome and, I believe, designed to put you off. I made three attempts to notify Jetstar of such poor training but each time I had to wait to “speak” to an online chat bot - all three dropped out. Won’t be going back unfortunately, although it was a beautiful place which I hope I can look back, reflect on and enjoy after I get over this trauma.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

It is really worth traveling to a different airport even if journey time is much longer. Avoid!!,NEGATIVE,Positive
Abuja,airport,Mark Bickerton,5/24/2009,The international terminal is nice and quite well organised but there is nothing much to do there. The domestic terminal is madness especially between 4pm and 7pm when many flights depart for Lagos.

Bangkok Don Muang,airport,D Barter,6/2/2022,"The domestic terminal is better than the international, seemingly having been refurbished during Covid. Both have adequate food options.

A small coin inadvertently left in a pocket will immediately incur their wrath. Perhaps their rigorous practical training could also include occasional use of the words 'please' and 'thank you'. Polite manners to avoid confrontations are as important when dealing with foreigners as they are with the locals.

Antananarivo,airport,1 reviewsL Shaw,9/10/2017,"I passed through this airport 4 times during August and September 2017. Arrived and Departed for flights to Europe (2x) and Internal flights (2x). I agree with everything recently written but add a few additional points. 1) Watch out for the Euro coin scammers. Locals trying to exchange euro coins for notes. They will show you 20 Euros in coins and ask for a note in exchange. They are expert at a sleight of hand confidence trick. You will not get the correct change once they count it out for you. 2) There is a cafe on the first floor of international departures that is open 24x7 and is the only non-airside seating area. Particularly useful if your flight is delayed and are awaiting check in to open. 3) The Duty Free was open until 0100 am for the Air France Paris flight 4) I flew Kenyan Airlines to Nairobi, this was a flight originating in Mozambique or Reunion but assigned seat was not available as the transiting passengers were already stretched out over all seats. It ended up as a free for all for the remaining free seats.",NEUTRAL,Negative

Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,10/23/2011,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports. It's easier to use than Rio or Sao Paulo at least until you get to the cramped gate area.,NEUTRAL,Positive

Accra Kotoka,airport,K Teague,9/21/2018,"Beautiful state of the art equipment but some poor organisation despite lots of friendly staff. Nobody tells you the procedure, join this queue then shuffle along only to be told you should have gone to the luggage weigh-in queue first. Weigh luggage then rejoin back of check in queue. Told to go to security, shuffle along for a bit then someone asks for departure card. Leave security queue, go to desk where you collect and fill departure card then rejoin back of security queue. Suggest check in desk staff give you a departure card so you will know to fill it in before going through security. Takes a while to shuffle through that and go through immigration departure check then security check. All took about one and a half hours. At gate we were divided into groups 1-5. Not enough seats for group 5 although most passengers are in this group. Infrastructure is very impressive and no doubt they will eventually streamline procedures. Sign posting would be a good start. Shopping and dining facilities are mostly not yet open so I cannot comment on this aspect yet. So, first taste of new terminal: not half bad. Clean, spacious, excellent kit, friendly staff but poor procedures.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Bermuda,airport,Raymond Breland,4/20/2005,"Like Bermuda itself this airport is a thoroughly civilized experience - not very busy so not crowded with a rather predictable traffic pattern of arrivals and departures. Facilities are very adequate and the duty-free shop has a reasonable variety albeit a bit expensive. On entry customs officials are polite and welcoming. When checking in for our departing flight the official who had to ""pat me down"" for a follow-up security check (the machine beeped when I went through) apologized for having to do so and thanked me for accommodating the security process! All in all a refreshingly unique experience - one that is alas vanishing amid the all-too-common post 9/11 over-zealous and ironically ineffective security measures elsewhere - Bravo to Bermuda and its airport!!",POSITIVE,Negative
Brasilia,airport,G Villela,4/8/2009,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice. But a light-rail line is planned for the next couple of years and that should improve things a lot.,NEUTRAL,Negative

The Immigration was very good due to using e-scanning system and took us less than 5 minute both departure and arrival (we did not even use priority lane which we were elligible to do so). The shops and restaurants were easy to find and were on both end or corridore. The public transportation when we arrived was quite easy and rather systematic to use, euther taxi, Grab, bus or rail link.

Bremen,airport,3 reviewsAndrew Coogans,6/28/2015,"Flew in and out of the dedicated Ryanair terminal (Terminal E) at Bremen Airport, but also spent some time in the other main terminal complex. Upon arrival, the Immigration desks were efficient, but the queuing area seemed to be slightly small for a full Boeing 737-800, and indeed there was a small area outside to accommodate a queue. The terminal seems to be a converted hangar, and serves its purpose well. Baggage collection time was fine. Amazingly close tram stop outside, along with office blocks and hotels. It feels like the airport is simply another building in the middle of the city. The tram is a very convenient and cheap way into the city centre. On departure, we walked through the main terminal to get to Terminal E. It appeared very spacious and quiet. There appeared to be adequate check in desks for the flights that were operating and the whole place seemed very tranquil. Terminal E itself was busy. About a 10 minute wait at Security and then the gate area seemed very crowded, particularly for the non-Schengen area flights, of which there were 2 departing within 5 minutes of each other. Still, I was impressed with this airport and would have no issues about using it again.",POSITIVE,Neutral

Adana,airport,Robert Clark,5/17/2006,"Adana Airport is a chaotic airport at best yet not as bad as airports in other countries that surround it. There are two terminals to the Adana Airport Domestic and International. In most cases the International side is only for the pilgrimage flights to Makkah Saudi Arabia and some limited flights into Northern Cyprus. The Domestic side starts with citizens wanting to take your bags up to the security screening (right at the entrance to the terminal). They will expect a tip for this very small action. Tell them ""hayir saa olun"" and you'll be left alone. You'll put your bags onto the belt and your passport will be checked. Even if you are flying domestically have your passport on you at all times. They will check the validity of your visa and if you have over-extended your welcome. Once you are through (P.S. Security does not speak English so bring some phrases with you) you will have to go to the airline of your choice. Even if you have no luggage and paper tickets you will still have to check in. Organized chaos is the best way I can put it. Regardless if you are flying Turkish Pegasus or Onur Air you will still have people cutting in line using Hefty bags as luggage and uncomfortable closeness. When you finally get to the front the people at the ticket counter normally speak english. MAKE SURE you ask if your bags get taken all the way. Some times they do - sometimes they don't. You may have to pick them back up in Istanbul so its important they make it clear. Once you are done you are left in a terminal that reeks of a foul Turkish soguk gone bad sick passengers that don't cover their mouths when they cough passengers that make that disgusting ""spit like a man"" sound and the ever famous stare. There is a smoking section but it is not seperate from any other room so non-smokers will be subjected to 2nd hand smoke. There is a small store that sells refreshments but does not open until 6am while some flights are much earlier. You'll be hard pressed for a seat so get to the airport early or get used to standing. Keep an eye on your things at all times. Lots of people look suspicious. The loudspeaker is hard to understand in this dimly lighted building and its usually only in Turkish. Just line up whenever everyone else does and try to sneak a peak at their ticket to see if it is your flight. You will go through a second security and enter the gate area. Once again - organized chaos. There is no ""area calling"" and to ""rows 1-10."" Its a massive cattle heard. Just try to get in the front. Once your identity and ticket are checked you will walk out onto the tarmac where you will see a bunch of suitcases (and Hefty bags) This is where is can get confusing. Before you can board the place you must claim your suitcase yet again and give it to the baggage handlers. I guess this is good since you do ensure it gets on the plane but if its a large flight it can be difficult in the dark to find your items. DEPARTURE INTERNATIONAL: Should you get lucky enough and go through immigration in Adana it is much easier than Istanbul. The Duty Free section is very tiny and only has alcohol and cigarettes but the customs queues are tiny in comparison to Istanbul. This may happen to you even if you are going through Istanbul to an international flight so it is always best to check over at International first to see if you leave from there or domestic. For your sake I hope you leave Internationally. ARRIVAL: Landings are pretty simple. If you go through customs (there will only be like 10 of you) you will go through a small customs kiosk your passport will be scrutinized and you'll get to have a rare ""Adana"" stamp in your passport unlike most who travel to Turkey with the ""Istanbul"" stamp. Your bags will come on a low riding baggage claim separate from the domestic fliers and quick out the door. If you are flying in domestically (or after checking into customs in Istanbul) you will have to wait quite a long time before the bags finally arrive onto the low riding baggage claim. In here is where you can rent a car as well about 4 companies are available on site and for those going to the NATO base there is a Hertz located in the Burger King. Back to the airpoort when you get outside you can be picked up by your people (they will not be allowed into the airport) or you can hire a taxi. A gentleman usually brings the taxi to you and loads your bags he will expect a tip. 2 YTL is good enough. P.S. - A good taxi (spelled taksi in Turkish) to go with would be Gate Taxi at +90(322)316TAXI - they speak English. It will cost more but the drivers have better English than the airport taxis) In the airport just dial 322316TAXI. One more thing before I forget - turn around whern you enter the terminal - you'll see the lost luggage department. If you fly here to Adana more than once - expect to go in here a few times. The airport itself is a dirty mess...it smells the facilities are usually dirty it reeks of smoke and it gets pretty loud.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Budapest Ferihegy,airport,Manny Greene,7/6/2024,"6 hour delay with no information. Supposed to be a 7:15pm departure. Display board at BUD contradicted information we received by Wizz Air on website.

Why doesn't the airport service remain open until at least 10pm each night as there are so many later evening flights. We are encouraged to check in 3 hours early which means I spent 9 hours at that airport. Ridiculous. No airport services available.

I panicked and thought there was no hope that I would find the goods. I called the airport just to try our luck.

Only a few moments later, the airport called me that they found my items at the lost and found. A janitor had turned them in. We can arrange to collect the items anytime.

This guy with glasses who was manning the airport subway counter yelled at me just because I was unable to comprehend Chinese. Instead of expecting others to know his language, he should learn how to speak proper English himself since he is working at an airport that deals with international arrivals and departures.

Baltimore Washington,airport,S Kaylen,12/29/2023,"After arriving at BWI Airport around 5 PM from Detroit, I had to wait for two hours after touchdown for the handlers to begin bringing out the luggage and my suitcase was not among those that arrived. Upon enquiry at the Lost Luggage room, I was told that the plane was too heavy, so my suitcase (which was not anywhere near being overweight) had been randomly selected to be rerouted (thrown off the plane) to another airport. It would therefore now arrive at 10 PM from Chicago Midway. So I was given two choices: wait at the airport till 10 PM for my bag to arrive, or go home and wait ""two days"" for them to ""Overnight"" the bag to me via FedEX.  Really, how much extra fuel would it take for my normal-weight suitcase to be included in the original flight? I opted for the former option and prepared to settle in for a three-hour vigil at the BWI airport. At 10 PM I was at the conveyor belt that ground staff said I should stand at to wait for my suitcases. They said the plane would be 12 minutes late. And so I waited. Eventually another showed up. She was there to pick up her elderly mother who was on that plane from Chicago. She expressed concern as it was the first time her mother was flying using a walker. I would periodically check with ground crew if I was really standing at the right place. They always replied with the same thing: when the suitcases start arriving from Chicago they would be at belt 3. But it wasn't until well after 11 PM that I saw the belt I should be standing it was now Belt 4. The ground crew had not bothered to tell me about the change, even though I was standing near their desk and in regular conversation with them. The bags started rolling in and by 11:43 PM I was finally able to retrieve my suitcase. When I questioned the ground crew about the delay, they were very defensive and said that it wasn't as late as I thought because it took a long time for the plane to reach a gate, and they count the delay from the moment it does so. So there you are. This was my unplanned adventure on December 27. I hope your experience with Southwest Airlines and the BWI Airport is better than mine has been of late.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,J Segal,1/30/2008,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Addis Ababa,airport,C London,6/11/2024,"I was pretty frustrated by the experience, mainly due to unhelpful staff. I arrived at 5:00 a.m. and in every waiting area there were staff sleeping. They were all under blankets, and it seems the airport should provide them appropriate rest areas instead of using areas passengers are supposed to use.  After disembarking my first flight, we went through full security with x-rays and no liquids above 100ml. When my flight was announced a few hours later, I then had to go through another security checkpoint just before the flight. No one had warned us of this second repeated security so many people had to throw away the drinks bought the flight at airport prices.  A lot of charging points are broken. Trying to raise issues with staff is met with apathy and disinterest.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bergerac,airport,Michael Souter,7/15/2013,I was looking forward to using Bergerac Airport for the first time. But the experience was dreadful. I thought it would be much quicker to check in and go through security. But it was the worst airport I have experienced. There was only one person most of the time checking in the flight who was spending a ridiculous amount of time in each passenger. As a frequent flyer I know of no other airport where every single carry on bag is checked in. Security is over zealous checking in more detail than any other airport I have ever visited. It was a horrible experience which spoilt my visit to the Dordogne.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Amsterdam Schiphol,airport,Harry Chapman,2/9/2025,"I have flown through here a number of times in the past year and it is disorganised and awful. The signs are often wrong, they divert you to different places and the staff are rude. I fly a lot and it is one of the worst airports, there are many better ones in much poorer countries. A leading European economy shouldn’t have this kind of chaos",NEGATIVE,Neutral
