Aalborg,airport,4 reviewsAnnika Fredenstrand,3/19/2017,"The baggage claim areas have obviously been merged to one since I last flew into Aalborg Airport with luggage. When coming to the only baggage claim area in the airport, in the end of the airport, where only airlines like Norwegian used to deliver luggage, there were no signs what so ever of our SK1207 luggage arriving - and thus I stepped out of the baggage claim area - not able to reenter - and with a tiresome wait for some 30 minutes until the airport staff had located my luggage. Better signs and maybe announcements - would do a big difference!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Aberdeen,airport,E Morran,12/2/2023,"Going through airport with sunflower lanyard. Staff are trained to see it and be more ""caring and patient"" but obviously, they just happened to be blind to it again. After many years of travelling through this awful place, I've had enough. Before covid, this airport was decent. The staff were usually friendly, helpful and could have a laugh. But recently, there were only two people who were decent. The rest were either miserable or visibly too terrified to speak. It's possible they were on edge and looking for someone or maybe their bosses were watching. It was interesting that 10+ people in a row beeped at the metal detector as well. Everything was so tense that myself and many others were talking back to the staff when they were trying to boss us about. One person almost started a fight. It also didn't help that one guy cut in front of me, put his stuff in my tray then walked off. The staff saw it, allowed it and walked away when I tried to question it. I was thinking that time was running out for my flight because I was given the wrong time on my boarding pass so obviously I was getting impatient. Tried to shove this guy's stuff onto the conveyer and got shouted at by a miserable so-and-so. Of course, I retaliated. Of course they walked away. Check-in: Miserable as always. Security: one decent, one terrified and the rest miserable. Gate staff: Miserable and one was sneezing over everything. Aberdeen Airport drains the life out of everyone. There are many people in this world. Some happy, some miserable, etc. But how can one place filled with so many different people consistently hold so many miserable people? I believe they're either so bored or so horrible that they enjoy making it a miserable experience. Then they have the gall to say ""Enjoy your flight/Thanks for X"". Best to just say the bare minimum and quietly get through it. Aberdeen is a pathetic place in general especially when it comes to transport.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Aberdeen,airport,Margaret Ferguson,2/23/2023,"Firstly, let me say that the Special Assistance Team at Aberdeen are THE BEST. Helpful, accommodating and friendly, nothing too much trouble. It's the rest of the airport which lets them down! We were on a Tui flight due to fly at 2.50pm The check-in board said check-in opens at 12.20. We joined the queue at 12.15. No sign of any staff at the desks. A person in what may have been Tui colours appeared at one of the desks, shuffled some papers, walked away. Another person in airport livery then approached the desk, looked at the papers, and walked off. The check-in desk actually opened, by ONE of the two staff at a different desk than advertised at 12.30. A minute later, a guy joined at an adjacent desk After check-in, security. The lady on the desk said I'd asked for assistance so should have a wheel chair. I didn't need one for this airport, just help with the steps to the plane. Nope, she said it was the rule, and sent me back to the assistance desk. Assistance guy escorted me back to security and explained that it wasn't quite the rule, Through security, to a very quiet shopping mall. Down the steps to the departure lounge. There is a small lift thing, but I'm scared of it, Would you believe the coffee shop at departures was closed. There is a soft drinks and confectionary machine but no coffee. Hubby then went back up the stairs and eventually found a coffee shop open in the mall, I realise that the airport was not busy, which is odd for a Saturday. But really, to not have an open coffee shop or indeed not to show it closed before the departure lounge, is poor. Maybe we are all expected to pay the exorbitant fee for the Northern Lights lounge. The next problem was indeed the departure. I don't know whose fault this is, whether Tui or airport administration, but it's at least inefficient. The departure board said gate opens 2.15. We could see the plane on its usual stance-It comes from Tenerife, gets cleaned, turns round and goes back I believe. We had been told gate 1. We got there at about 2.20 and were taken to the plane lift when the flight was eventually announced. We waited in the lift at the emergency door, for a good five minutes until the door was opened. By this time it was 2.35. We could see the queue of passengers for the other doors, in the cold wind and gathering clouds. There were babies and toddlers in that queue. As an aside, this stance is one of the farthest away from the terminal. BA flights have covered walkways from the terminal itself. Maybe it's something to do with landing fees, for which I believe Aberdeen is expensive. Eventually we were allowed to board. The plane was absolutely perfectly clean I have to say. Just unfortunate for those poor passengers who had to wait so long in the cold, with young children. All in all a poor airport experience",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abidjan,airport,D Sane,12/13/2017,"I have been transiting a few times recently. The airport looks clean, nice and modern, but it's very disorganised. Boarding passes are checked more than five times, while once or twice should be enough. Security screening sees long queues up into the immigration area, due to excessive scrutiny. Transit passengers need to queue to have their boarding pass checked, a practice I haven't seen anywhere else in the world. This all adds to delays, affecting connecting flights as well. For boarding Air Côte d'Ivoire, passengers are asked to wait outside of the terminal, for a bus to the plane, several destinations combined. This kind of takes away the point of checking the boarding pass five times over before completing the boarding process within the terminal. WiFi is free for just half an hour. The terminal is modern and clean, but even at this small size it already looks very overstretched. Lomé Airport does a better job of being a hub in West Africa.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abidjan,airport,Simon Gooch,5/3/2016,"I have been through Abidjan a few times and whilst I was impressed on my first visit, progressive improvements since then mean that it is definitely the best airport I have been to in Africa. There is now decent and free wifi in the departures area, a comfortable new cafe and the information boards are clear.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Abidjan,airport,Pedro Gil,12/20/2006,I frequently travel through this airport and would note a couple of problems in an otherwise nice facility. First I've arrived on another airline and been unable to get help in the transit lounge from Air I'voire even though they are my next flight. You have to get somebody to take you to the front desk through a little back hallway and tip them. Second if you go through the passport desk they have plain clothed policemen without badges who demand your passport in the luggage area without identifying themselves. The restaurant in the departure area is much nicer than the one outside the ticket area where you check in.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abu Dhabi,airport,Gary Colburn,10/18/2024,"Super modern airport, bright shiny and very clean. Security control was reasonably quick on departure and arrival and I found the staff professional, although they don't smile a lot. Bonus points for having showers after security, I took one and it was marvellous. I wasn't sold on Abu Dhabi itself but the airport is certainly one of the best I've experienced in recent times.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Abu Dhabi,airport,E Marsel,6/11/2024,"On 10th of June I had a connection flight from Abu Dhabi to London at 2pm at gate D43. As I knew there was an additional security check at the gate and it had never been pleasant but this time it was enough uncomfortable to me therefore i decided to share my experience. I was searched by a female security officer and her professionalism was questionable. Her First question was about my mental health. When I answered positively, she laughed. She did my fully body check without asking me about permission. For a whole time she treated me as a suspect not as a customer. She asked me about sharp items and box matches with a joyable voice. She found even my period products very suspicious as well, having a lot of fun in meantime. I had a few security checks before her that day already and a flight. She left me with anxiety level until the roof wishing me a ""good day"". When I decided to pay a good money for a good airline I expected a good customer service at the airport as well.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Abu Dhabi,airport,B Vanetee,2/14/2024,"As inefficient as the old airport. The only thing that has changed is the infrastructure. Self checkin kiosks, gates and shopping are the positives. Staff quality is as pathetic and inefficient as was before. Boarded through gate E. Took almost 45 mins to get to the bus.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,M Parker,3/5/2017,"Abuja airport is closing on 7 March for 6 weeks until 18 April for reconstruction of the runway. The nearest airport to Abuja during this period is Kaduna a 3 hour drive or train ride away so getting to and from the capital of Nigeria is going to be a big hassle until the airport reopens. The only international airline currently planning to fly into Kaduna is Ethiopian - otherwise you will have to fly to Lagos and take a domestic flight to Kaduna. Abuja airport when reopened is not too bad to use (by Nigerian standards). The international terminal is not very busy so getting through is pretty painless. The domestic terminal is in the same location - check in is on one side of the internatonal terminal (for most airlines) and the actual departures area on the other side so you have to come out of the check in area and then walk past international departures and back into the departures area. The actual departures area is up an external metal staircase which is a bit of a schlep. At the top you re-enter the building go through security and are in the departures area. It's quite large and there is air-conditioning but sometimes it gets very crowded if there are lots of delayed flights (which is very common). There are some lounges you can pay to use for about N2,000 ($4) so that is well worth it if you are facing a long delay as you will get a more comfy seat, cleaner toilets, better airconditioning and a cup of tea and a biscuit. There are a couple of cafes in the main area selling mostly Nigerian food and a few shops selling the sort of things you find in any Nigerian market. To board the domestic flights you have to exit the departures area down another external metal staircase and then get in a bus or walk to your plane depending on how far away it is parked. On arrival you actually come into the International departures and arrivals building where but you have to exit to the outside to locate your transport as only passengers are allowed into the building itself. One irritating thing about the airport is the X ray bag check to enter each building so if you are flying domestic you have to go through this twice entering the building and then a 3rd time when you are going into the departures area. International arrivals can be a slow process if two international flights arrive at the same time as there is only one desk for international passport holders and a lengthy two person process where someone from state security first checks your passport and then passes it to the immigration official. Be aware that on exiting the baggage claim area in both domestic and international areas you may be asked to show your baggage claim tags so they can be compared with the tags on your bags. I can't recommend the airport but if you are travelling to Abuja it is your only option (once it reopens). It is also much easier to use than Lagos international terminal if you are arriving in Nigeria for the first time. A new international terminal is under construction and due to open later this year. At this point the current strangely laid out mixture of domestic and international should become the domestic terminal. To get from the airport to Abuja is about a 40 minute drive down a wide multilane highway. It is best to arrange a pick up in advance to avoid ending up in a rather tatty and potentially unsafe normal taxi at the airport. The cost to Abuja should be between N5,000 to N10,000 depending on the state of the taxi.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,Sumaiya Yakubu,4/25/2016,"For starters Abuja airport was super hot, no air conditioning or at least fans. Everything you do in the airport you pay for yet provision simple services is poor. It also took too long for bags to arrive while there were not enough seats. I am ashamed right now as a Nigerian. Unfriendly staff as well - it needs serious intervention.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,A Cobo,8/8/2011,Abuja international arrivals greets you with a long immigration line. Only one booth is set up to accommodate a complete flight with another booth for dignitaries and diplomats. One can stand for over 1 hour in this line while the immigration clerk scrutinizes your passport and visa. The people are generally nice and polite the airport is clean. AC is mediocre. International departure was crowded and not very comfortable and in most places extremely hot. Food options are limited. Abuja national terminal is another story. Very hot limited seating not so clean limited food options and crowded. There are no flight departure screens. In general an unkempt image.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,C Stafford,1/31/2010,Upon arrival from Amsterdam on KLM I went to use the bathroom and there was no garbage can and no toilet paper. The airport was cleaner than I expected. I think it's better than Lagos actually. Our luggage failed to arrive with us and we were told to come back in 3 days time to pick it up! We weren't going to be anywhere near Abuja in 3 days! We were told later by the airline (after we got back to the US) that they should have delivered it to us. (It was a 6 hour drive one way by the way.) Leaving was a nightmare. They had no record of our changed flight days and had no way of checking with our credit card (we were told that's all we would need to verify our changed dates-a credit card.) We were told to step aside while they helped other passengers. Then we were sent to one person who told us to go to another person etc etc. It took two hours to straighten out the mess and that was only because my husband had to beg the woman to let him use her computer so he could check his email which he was sure would have a confirmation of the change. I will say this particular woman was very professional and willing to do whatever it took to help us. Boarding passes were hand-written. Upon checking our baggage the woman typed in LIM instead of ILM which meant our bags were heading for Lima Peru not Wilmington North Carolina! This screw-up was revealed to us upon arriving in Atlanta. Overall not a good experience with the airport or maybe it was just KLM/Delta. Who knows. I was not impressed.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,Mark Bickerton,5/24/2009,The international terminal is nice and quite well organised but there is nothing much to do there. The domestic terminal is madness especially between 4pm and 7pm when many flights depart for Lagos. Its more like an old bus station than an airport and I am not sure the security is that strong (last time I was there the boarding passes were handwritten on small pieces of photocopied paper),POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,S Adewale,3/3/2007,In Nigerian standards relatively clean and organized. However I was bored out of my mind when waiting for my flight because the shopping and entertainment possibilities is nil. Overall and compared to Lagos domestic terminal this airport is paradise on earth.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,Jacob Thomas,3/21/2024,"The facilities are fine. The check in staff at the checkin time is ok. When you reach the boarding gate, they will make you stand in a queue for an unnecessary check to tick the boarding pass with their pen and then make you wait again. The staff at this check point has already interviewed you at the check in counter. They have a rude behaviour and tone and not friendly at all.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,M Addo,6/4/2022,"Corruption Central. Its funny that Kotoko airport has an announcement stating that it doesn't condone the extortion of customers, however does not provide any means of complaints and its scary to complain to the members of staff as they may also try to extort you. Got stopped by the security at the exit on my arrival wanting to know what was in my bag and after finding out there was nothing of worthwhile value they then asked if I could ""bless a brother"". On my return, then got stopped for another ""blessing"" by an immigration officer. Honestly, for such a beautiful airport it downgrades the whole airport and does not send out an inviting message.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,B Triplett,12/13/2021,"This airport, is structurally nice and clean! That's the best part. The staff are super rude, bossy, constantly looking for someone to move or push or tell to do something irrelevant to getting people where they need to go. The instructions received are short and rude! The systems and procedures are non existing, numerous people checking and rechecked and scribbling on your ticket. I had my passport, covid, and boarding pass checked 10 times after security and sitting at the gate, it's not even possible to get to the gate without all of those having been checked?",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,H Steensen,8/20/2021,"The airport with the worst business class lounges and partly very corrupt staff. No possibilities to sit in certain areas where it would be a must to have the opportunity. Finding your way within the airport is very difficult, not enough signs to find what you are looking for. Some of the staff is ignorant and arrogant, providing bad service.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,Ama Afari,7/16/2021,"Warning to other travellers using Kotoka airport drop off. There's a deliberate system of entrapment. We arrived at the airport to drop off my friend who was travelling. As she had to pick up a copy of her Covid test result we dropped her off and was told by one of the staff that we should rather drive around to the other side by the bus stop. We drove around the area waiting for her to call us that she was ready so we could drive her to the new side of the airport to catch her flight. When she was ready, we drove to the side of the road (near the bus stop) where the staff member told us to go to. Another member of staff then proceeded to stand by the car, said you can't pick up here and called over two other men who put a clamp on our wheel. This happened in the space of less than 30 seconds. We were shocked of course and told them she would be late for her flight to which he responded he doesn't care. They demanded we pay 150 cedis. While we were talking to the men, several cars parked in the same spot and picked up passengers. We asked why their cars weren't being clamped too. They stood by and let these cars pick up and drive off. They continued to refuse to unclamp our car. We paid the 150 cedis because we didn't want our friend to miss her flight. The attendant then tried to refuse to give us a receipt for the fine we just paid which led to more arguing. During this time one of the attendants used his hand to push our brother who then pushed him back. Us ladies had to stand between the men to stop them physically fighting. He obviously wanted to pocket the cash. We dropped our friend and enquired with other airport staff where the main office is for the enforcers. We spoke to two men  at the office who said they were supervisors. They listened to our story and I showed them the video clip. They didn't offer any assistance except to say we should come back tomorrow morning to speak to the general manager. Looks like everyone there is probably taking a portion of the money from this operation they have going on. As a Ghanaian, I feel the corruption here (from the top down) is too widespread, preventing our country from improving.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,13 reviewsAlain Kupferman,1/30/2017,"Old airport, but reconstruction going on. Very efficient immigration on the way in, with separate lane for business class. Fast delivery of luggage as well, took me less than 15 minutes to be out of the airport. Departure wise a little bit slower, but acceptable, friendly immigration and security people, very basic business lounge. Departure procedure efficient, despite lack of discipline of Chinese passengers, always trying to jump queues.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,Hans Gross,12/23/2013,This time it took 2 hours instead of the usual half hour for landing and immigration. The huge delay was caused first by a 'parking problem' for the aircraft second by the malfunction of 2 of the 3 luggage conveyor belts. For the return embarkation Emirates with its 300-seater had set the check-in period to from 12.30 am (instead of the usual 3.30 pm) until 5.30 pm which did not prevent a delay again of 1 hour for the take-off at 8 pm. The main annoyances of this airport have persisted over the last 10 years: Passengers may enter soaked with sweat and cannot have a shower (I go to the Landing restaurant and try to wipe myself in the toilet room). The sweating continues in the departure hall which is only half air-conditioned. Announcements can barely be understood as there is a cacophony stemming from the sound of TV's and the voices of passengers. It also remains amusing to count the number of passenger controls and checks: there are 4 by the airline and about 6 by other airport staff.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Adana,airport,William Foran,10/4/2007,Adana is in the southern part of Turkey and so the grounds of the airport are full of palm trees and other desert flora. It is chaotic as the previous reviewer has commented. What was amazing to see was aircraft taxiing in on the same part of the tarmac as passengers walking in from their recently landed flights. I recommend the restaurant on the second level. The food was terrific ( it is frequently so in Turkey) and the view (Including the aforementioned strange combination of people and aircraft) was very entertaining. Most of the flights are domestic/commuter flights and therefore the airport is otherwise very quiet apart from the morning and evening rush hours. Yes one could get a whiff of tobacco smoke or strange odors in the terminal but this is the middle east. One should take these differences between our world and theirs in stride.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Adana,airport,Robert Clark,5/17/2006,"Adana Airport is a chaotic airport at best yet not as bad as airports in other countries that surround it. There are two terminals to the Adana Airport Domestic and International. In most cases the International side is only for the pilgrimage flights to Makkah Saudi Arabia and some limited flights into Northern Cyprus. The Domestic side starts with citizens wanting to take your bags up to the security screening (right at the entrance to the terminal). They will expect a tip for this very small action. Tell them ""hayir saa olun"" and you'll be left alone. You'll put your bags onto the belt and your passport will be checked. Even if you are flying domestically have your passport on you at all times. They will check the validity of your visa and if you have over-extended your welcome. Once you are through (P.S. Security does not speak English so bring some phrases with you) you will have to go to the airline of your choice. Even if you have no luggage and paper tickets you will still have to check in. Organized chaos is the best way I can put it. Regardless if you are flying Turkish Pegasus or Onur Air you will still have people cutting in line using Hefty bags as luggage and uncomfortable closeness. When you finally get to the front the people at the ticket counter normally speak english. MAKE SURE you ask if your bags get taken all the way. Some times they do - sometimes they don't. You may have to pick them back up in Istanbul so its important they make it clear. Once you are done you are left in a terminal that reeks of a foul Turkish soguk gone bad sick passengers that don't cover their mouths when they cough passengers that make that disgusting ""spit like a man"" sound and the ever famous stare. There is a smoking section but it is not seperate from any other room so non-smokers will be subjected to 2nd hand smoke. There is a small store that sells refreshments but does not open until 6am while some flights are much earlier. You'll be hard pressed for a seat so get to the airport early or get used to standing. Keep an eye on your things at all times. Lots of people look suspicious. The loudspeaker is hard to understand in this dimly lighted building and its usually only in Turkish. Just line up whenever everyone else does and try to sneak a peak at their ticket to see if it is your flight. You will go through a second security and enter the gate area. Once again - organized chaos. There is no ""area calling"" and to ""rows 1-10."" Its a massive cattle heard. Just try to get in the front. Once your identity and ticket are checked you will walk out onto the tarmac where you will see a bunch of suitcases (and Hefty bags) This is where is can get confusing. Before you can board the place you must claim your suitcase yet again and give it to the baggage handlers. I guess this is good since you do ensure it gets on the plane but if its a large flight it can be difficult in the dark to find your items. DEPARTURE INTERNATIONAL: Should you get lucky enough and go through immigration in Adana it is much easier than Istanbul. The Duty Free section is very tiny and only has alcohol and cigarettes but the customs queues are tiny in comparison to Istanbul. This may happen to you even if you are going through Istanbul to an international flight so it is always best to check over at International first to see if you leave from there or domestic. For your sake I hope you leave Internationally. ARRIVAL: Landings are pretty simple. If you go through customs (there will only be like 10 of you) you will go through a small customs kiosk your passport will be scrutinized and you'll get to have a rare ""Adana"" stamp in your passport unlike most who travel to Turkey with the ""Istanbul"" stamp. Your bags will come on a low riding baggage claim separate from the domestic fliers and quick out the door. If you are flying in domestically (or after checking into customs in Istanbul) you will have to wait quite a long time before the bags finally arrive onto the low riding baggage claim. In here is where you can rent a car as well about 4 companies are available on site and for those going to the NATO base there is a Hertz located in the Burger King. Back to the airpoort when you get outside you can be picked up by your people (they will not be allowed into the airport) or you can hire a taxi. A gentleman usually brings the taxi to you and loads your bags he will expect a tip. 2 YTL is good enough. P.S. - A good taxi (spelled taksi in Turkish) to go with would be Gate Taxi at +90(322)316TAXI - they speak English. It will cost more but the drivers have better English than the airport taxis) In the airport just dial 322316TAXI. One more thing before I forget - turn around whern you enter the terminal - you'll see the lost luggage department. If you fly here to Adana more than once - expect to go in here a few times. The airport itself is a dirty mess...it smells the facilities are usually dirty it reeks of smoke and it gets pretty loud.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Addis Ababa,airport,C London,6/11/2024,"I was pretty frustrated by the experience, mainly due to unhelpful staff. I arrived at 5:00 a.m. and in every waiting area there were staff sleeping. They were all under blankets, and it seems the airport should provide them appropriate rest areas instead of using areas passengers are supposed to use.  After disembarking my first flight, we went through full security with x-rays and no liquids above 100ml. When my flight was announced a few hours later, I then had to go through another security checkpoint just before the flight. No one had warned us of this second repeated security so many people had to throw away the drinks bought the flight at airport prices.  A lot of charging points are broken. Trying to raise issues with staff is met with apathy and disinterest.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Addis Ababa,airport,Simon Castleman,4/9/2024,"ADD Bole airport is a zoo. On our outbound flight we arrived from London and passed through security and from there to the lounge and boarded the plane to VFA. On the way back having been through security at VFA and again during transit at ADD we had to go through security again near the gate. Not only that we then had a secondary screening and two lots of document checks. With three flights leaving within 30 minutes of each other having one person looking at documents of 700+ people is just bonkers. I can see why people miss flights at this airport if you're not aware of this. If you are leaving from gates A14-16 inclusive, which seems to be the only part of the airport where this happens, you need to leave a good 20-30 minutes in addition to whatever time you think you need to get to the actual gate.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Addis Ababa,airport,Ralph Elsaesser,3/12/2024,"While flying with Ethiopian Airlines is rather reliable and straight-forward (in mostly a little bit outdated machines), the Airport is difficult. Checking in is a joke, people do not queue up, no-one guides you, and after the first security check you're covered in dust and dirt. If you then reach the departure hall, it looks not too bad (unless your gate is downstairs) but if you decide to take a drink, your name should be Elon Musk or so. I just observed that a young father was charged 20 Dollars for heating up his baby's milk. You have to pay 10 dollars for 0.4 liters of beer and the food is a nightmare (I must know it because in May 2023 I was not allowed to enter the country and stayed 36 hours at the airport). To summarize, you are treated as cattle but you pay as a king.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Addis Ababa,airport,Gulnar Manji,1/6/2024,"This is one of the most chaotic airports I’ve ever had the experience of being in. We were a family with a child in transit to Dar Es Salaam. On departure to Dar there were several gates and hundreds of people lined up in a corridor of 6-8 feet while other passengers waking up and down the same aisle pushing and shoving as there wasn’t room. Transfer buses were so unorganized with no one giving clear directions and people were pushing and shoving to get to the bus. On our return to Toronto, the security checks were so crowded, it was a shamble, and trays for shoes, purses took forever to come, and when a few trays came everyone tried to grab them creating such chaos. We had to go through security twice and body search!. On our way to gate A16 we had to go through the body scanner. My son was holding his three year old child and the security staff attempted to grab the child so only the father would be scanned. My son put his child down and told the security staff not to touch him yet the staff tried to grab the child and seeing a stranger the child of course started crying. When I told the female staff I would report them she rudely said to me go ahead and refused to give me her name and turned her badge around so I could not see the name. Just going through this airport was not only stressful but frustrating.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Addis Ababa,airport,M Collie,11/4/2023,"Transit in the early morning. Lucky to have airbridges for arrival and departure. Distances between gates can be massive. Airport is very busy, but less chaotic than it appears at first sight. The biz security line made the experience less stressful.",NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Addis Ababa,airport,H Smart,9/29/2023,"What a shambles this airport was for our very recent transits. The bus transfer from the incoming flight took forever and by the time we got to security the approximately ten wide column of people had to go down to one to go though security. When we got to the security screening there were no boxes to put liquids, laptops etc. into, and when someone eventually appeared with a stack of them it was a free for all as there wasn't enough to go round. Having survived security we had four hours before our connection to Dar Es Salaam. There were nowhere near enough seats and no air conditioning despite how warm it was. When the gate information came up, (C6 I think it was), we went to our departure gate to find there were two flights going from the same gate before ours, so there were hundreds of people waiting at our gate along with hundreds of others waiting for several other gates all in the same row. The electronic departure board stopped working, no staff to ask for information and another slow bus transfer out to the plane. The return experience was not much better although slightly better organised at security screening. Still not enough seats and still very hot in the main areas. When we went to our gate we had to wait to be admitted to gates A14 - 16 as again there were two flights leaving that area before ours. Seats were very difficult to get and when we finally went through to A15 we had to go through another security screening with shoes and belts off, again. When boarding started it was a free for all until a man appeared and stopped anyone who wasn't in zone 2, but as no announcement was made no-one knew it was boarding by zone number.

What a joke, 3 international flights at the same time arriving on a Saturday morning shouldn,t have been a problem but this is Adelaide Airport. Definitely could not deal with the amount of passengers coming into the customs and baggage area. Rude customs officers who looked so aggresive you dare not look at them. Some employee walking around with a stick in the baggage area saying queue here but kept changing her mind where she actually wanted people to queue to exit the area. That was quite amusing. Just chaos from start to finish and the comments that were coming from other passengers ranged from disbelief to embarrassing to hilarious. Worst international airport  I have gone through and such a negative first impression of Adelaide.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Adelaide,airport,M Morrison,7/5/2022,"Awful airport. Security took ages to go through and airport staff were mostly unfriendly except for one staff member who was pleasant. I travelled from London to Auckland and unfortunately had to transit via Adelaide. I had bought duty free items from London (foundations, face creams, perfume) - all within my NZ allowance and all packaged as bought with the receipt available. When going through security the staff hassled me and said I was not allowed to take the items through and they all needed to go into one clear plastic bag. I already had my travel toiletries in one clear plastic bag. The response was tough, you must choose what you want to take with or leave behind. I was definitely not leaving behind $250 worth of cosmetics! Everyone who witnessed this was appalled and agreed this was a ridiculous rule since the items were bought from duty free. I had no issue at Doha airport with the items. Fortunately I had fellow travelers (strangers) on the same flight who were able to take the goods through for me. Had this not been the case they would have forced me to leave items behind. I am very upset by this incident. This was extremely distressing after 30 hours of travel. I would not recommend Adelaide for transfer if this is how they treat international travelers.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Adelaide,airport,N Schuler,10/21/2019,"I have been a frequent flyer for many years with an average flight count of around 85 flights per year for the last 14 years, nationally and international. I used to be happy coming back to Adelaide but the last 2 years arrival at Adelaide to be a horrendous experience. The level of incompetence in getting people through was simply unbelievable. To put you in the picture, this experience I am going to describe happend almost the same on my last 3 international flights, all this year. So, my plane arrived first, a standard A380, followed 25 minutes later by another small international flight. Getting of the plane - quick, getting through passport control - quick and that is where the good part finishes. The luggage took 48 minutes to arrive, on 1 luggage carousel. By the time my bag arrived the queue was returning 3 times around the carousel, you could not even get to the end. Only one office checked the arrival card of every one, talked and saw the growing line building up. She send at least 60% through a line to be checked, and after another 15 minutes in the queue she did that to me too, even though I am APEC member. Another 12 minutes wait before the Officer could attend to me, x-rayed my bag and send me through. I was not allowed to inform my waiting driver (no phones or texting allowed) and he left by the time I came out over an hour later, so I had to join the Taxi queue. I have been to many bad managed airports, Rome, Dhaka, Athens, etc., but Adelaide is the undisputed champion for the worst international arrival service I have experienced. Better arrive from your international leg in Melbourne and take a domestic flight to Adelaide, you will be faster.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Adelaide,airport,M Graham,6/17/2019,I can safely say as a regular international traveller by far the worst international airport I've landed at is Adelaide. It has one carousel and even under moderate pressure the baggage wait is horrendous. In my case about 3 planes had landed and it took about an hour and a half to just get my bag. In total over 2 hours to finally get out the door. This place is a sad joke and if possible international travellers should avoid it at all costs and land at a decent Australian international airport.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Adelaide,airport,L Borrill,1/11/2019,"I have never reviewed a place before. But I have never been so let down by a service before either. We arrived and had a rocky landing. No big deal. Went to the bathroom straight after landing and then went to walk out the front. We walked through the electric door that took us to the rest of the airport and my little sister realised she had left her phone in the bathroom. We turned around and the doors had just shut behind us and we couldn’t get back in. We asked she security guy if she could run to the bathroom and he said no. Once you walk past the line you can’t come back. We asked how we could get in and he simply pointed in a direction and ignored us. Everything was closed, it was 11pm. We tried to ask him again how we could get back in and he still flat out ignored us. Another staff member walked past and said dont stand near the door. When we asked him where we could go him simply talked over us and said don’t negotiate. You can’t go in. Go away from the line. My little sister was in tears and she had saved and worked so hard to get her new phone. We called out the passengers coming through and asked them go check the toilets for us. We were so lucky that the passengers coming through were helpful because the staff would not even tell us how we could retrieve it. We weren’t trying to argue, weren’t drunk or loud. We simply wanted help. I understand their security reasons and wanting to keep the place safe. But the rudeness and lack of helpfulness from several staff member was disgusting. Worst help.

Agadir Al Massira,airport,J Davidson,3/28/2018,The security checks at this airport in Agadir is over the top. Luggage checked twice and passport control 4 times. Don't they trust each other? One customs officer has to check the work of the other customs officer? And rows and rows of people trying to find the quickest lanes. Completely inefficient process.

The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast.

Same on the return (also note that rental car stuff seems to be a convenient arrangement as well). ALB is as close to ""get there at the last minute and be OK"" as any these days. B terminal is the nicest. Of course this is a regional airport without many of the amenities of a large one. The coffee shop and bar/restaurant are better than most though.

Albuquerque,airport,S Theale,5/7/2022,"I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled security. Initially I was thrilled at the process and not separating people from their luggage like so many others. However, one of my bags got 'flagged' (ended up being for a stack of business cards) and it sat waiting to be checked for over 15 minutes. During that time I asked 4 different people about it and was brushed off with comments like 'They're sending someone over' or 'I'm sure they'll take care of it"" and they just walked off. It almost made me miss my flight and was just completely NOT okay.

Albuquerque,airport,39 reviewsW Jackson,4/19/2022,"ABQ is a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements. For starters: If you have TSA Pre-Check here, you're golden. Security is an efficient and friendly process. If you don't have Pre-Check, then the service, at least for a small airport, can be quite non-communicative, abrasive and slow. The pueblo-inspired architecture and interior design of the airport render it one of the most beautiful small airports in the USA, and the post-security viewing area of the runway and mountains is the sort of thing that more airports in this country need. However, it's not always easy to enjoy the design and the views when the tile and carpet flooring and seating throughout the airport are dirty and, for a lack of better words, dilapidated and outdated. Speaking of seating, there really isn't enough of it, in my opinion. The signage directing you to amenities, services and locations throughout the airport is helpful, but also outdated. The dining and shopping options are fine for a small airport, so no real complaints. Some people complain about the rental car facility being separate from the terminal and requiring a shuttle bus, but, honestly, the bus runs frequently and the ride is pretty short. Everything is easily accessible from I-25 and downtown Albuquerque. With a little modernization and polishing, ABQ has the potential be as good as new again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

The lines are short but it is still good to get in early. The seats in the boarding lounges are somewhat comfortable. When it comes to security it's okay. The airlines that you need to go through security for are Qantas and Virgin Australia but not Regional Express. The terminal is clean especially the toilets. The café is overpriced but the food is ok. The only shopping in the terminal is the café. Unlike most airports it is almost impossible to get lost in ABX. The only drawback is that to get to and from the terminal to or from the plane you have to walk across the tarmac. Out of all the airports I have been to ABX has been the best.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Alghero Fertilia,airport,Harry Albright,1/27/2006,A nice little airport actually in Fertilia rather than Alghero. It has been recently expanded and a new arrivals hall should be opening shortly. Arrivals are straightforward both Schengen and non-Schengen. There are two belts for luggage and then you are straight out to the arrivals hall. Car rental desks are opposite where you come out and there are a couple of cash machines as well as a bar and a few shops. At the bar you pay at the cash register then take the receipt to the bar. Apart from the car rentals there are taxis just outside arrivals although these are pricey (about 20 Euro to the centre of town). It's about 12km to Alghero. Another option is to turn right and cross the parking lot. About 100 metres away are bus stops with orange buses running to Alghero and other buses heading to Sassari and Cagliari. Buy tickets for the Alghero buses at the souvenir shop (about 70 cents) in the terminal. If this is closed ride the bus anyway. The driver will sometimes stop for you to buy tickets sometimes not. Departures is equally straightforward at the other end of the terminal from arrivals. Note though that there is absolutely nothing to do airside so don't go through too soon. Non-Schengen international flights (e.g. to the UK) all leave from gate 1 and you have to queue for passport checks before you are allowed in to the gate area. The immigration officers usually arrive about 30 minutes before the flight.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

I might have been lucky but I found the police controls and security to go fairly quickly. Shops are limited but I found them sufficient also they are open very early and close late. The choice of restaurants is limited to 1 for each hall and they are of the same provider. They offer reasonable selections of light eating and drinking. On arrivals I find it inadequate to have to walk down stairs after coming off the plane. I did not see an elevator available. The wait for the luggage is too long. I was told it was due to the luggage scanner being undersized for the traffic. One important deficiency is the absence of English signs; they are all in French and Arabic only. A shame for a brand new ""International"" airport.

Almaty,airport,S Baltanek,12/16/2021,"Almaty airport international departure lounge is only one hall, where everyone on all flights is jammed together. Extremely small space. The cafeteria available there are horrible to put it best, there is a Starbucks with very few tables. The cleanliness is substandard. Try not going to the toilets if you can: it is just a psychologically traumatic experience: the smell is horrible, not clean, often no paper towels available, the soap dispensers are just unpleasant to touch. Business class lounge at Almaty Airport is a huge scam, do not go there. It has very small space, poorly ventilated, all airlines crammed into one room, and the scam is that they charge for everything there, including for water, at overpriced rates. The security procedure is ridiculous. The passport control check passport and checks the face matches passport. The security check is roughly 10 meters after passport control, where there is a separate counter with someone checking passport and asking to show face. Now, the funniest part is that right after the counter, literally after taking 3-5 steps, there is another person who asks to show passport and checking the face again. I am not joking, this is seriously being done by people at the airport, literally three separate passport and face checks within 20 meters.

Almeria,airport,Dan Thorneycroft,8/25/2006,Reading some of the other reports of Almeria airport I have to say that I must have been lucky on the twenty or so times I have used the airport because I have not had any problems to complain about. The only serious problem which needs to be highlighted is the pilfering of baggage which happens. In view of the serious security problems at British airports someone in a foreign airport who can steal items from baggage could just as easily be putting something in! Almeria to Stansted appears to be the main problem and whilst the pilfering could be taking place at Stansted this is unlikely due to the limited amount of time the bags are available to the people doing the pilfering. The bags are out of sight at Almeria for up to 1.5 hours before the flight.,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE

A fairly sized terminal with Air Asia and Malaysian flying. Clean and very modern indeed with services and several shopping points for food. The process is fairly quick. There are only 2 gates with OK seating. The only downturn is that there is no monitor next to the gates and its not possible to see the plane on the tarmac so when we had a minor delay no one knew how much was the actual flying time and some were nervous. Otherwise very cheap flights to Kuala Lumpur- much better than a 7hrs bus ride for sure and a cheaper option to fly from BKK to southern Thailand just hop through the borders and fly to KL.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Amarillo,airport,Andrew Levy,1/7/2005,AMA has 2 passenger concourses but nearly all passengers must use the north concourse (serving the 30-series gates) serving American Eagle Continental Express and Southwest. The northwest concourse (serving the 20-series gates) is largely unused. As a result security screening at the north concourse is prone to long back-ups. One thought is for the airport to modify some leases and reassign tenants in order to ensure that the entire terminal is more uniformly utilized which would reduce terminal congestion.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Amman Queen Alia,airport,T Hilderbrandt,11/21/2024,"Terribly disorganized airport. Signage is horrible for international transfers. Had to go through security 3 times. E.g., bought some overpriced water by the boarding gate. Then they ordered all passengers out to go through security and then they took my water away. At security, they pulled my bag apart, then just stuffed things in randomly. I had to repack the whole thing. Few staff speak any English and they are rude. Also the airport has zero places to lie down anywhere. Avoid this airport if you can. They are amateurs in this business and a disgrace.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Amman Queen Alia,airport,2 reviewsMacit Samarah,8/17/2024,The airport has a nice design but it is not well maintained and you always feel it’s aging fast. The waiting time to reach immigration might take more than an hour in summer while bags might take on average 45 minutes in non-peak times. Duty free is good and the RJ lounge is very good with plenty of options. Toilet and hygiene facilities don’t have consistent standard,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Amman Queen Alia,airport,J Natinski,1/1/2024,"It was by far the worst airport experience I've ever had. The airport security personnel were incredibly rude and treated passengers with utter disrespect. They thoroughly searched through all of my belongings, including my medically prescribed medications, without any consideration for privacy or common courtesy. What shocked me the most was the length of time the security check took. Despite there not being a large number of people in line, the process took well over an hour, causing me to almost miss my flight. The airport was unprofessional and dirty. The facilities were poorly maintained, and the overall atmosphere was one of chaos and disorganization. It's clear that the staff are in need of proper training in customer service and basic hygiene practices. I would strongly advise anyone considering traveling through Amman International Airport to find an alternative route. The treatment and conditions at this airport are unacceptable, and I would never subject myself to such mistreatment and unhygienic conditions again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Amman Queen Alia,airport,M Hasheem,9/22/2023,"We flew from Jeddah (excellent) via Amman by RJ Business Class to London Heathrow. When we landed into Amman as business class passengers we were first to leave the aircraft. Upon leaving we were met by an airport staff member that asked where we are going and a queue of people from the previous aircraft waiting to get through security in the 2nd row. I explained i'm transiting to LHR an that I have 2 hours until my next flight leaves i should have been able to walk through the first security queue. He then demands i join the back of the 2nd queue (approx 200 people) while the people from my flight walk through security in the 1st queue. I explained again, i'm going to be late for my flight but was ignored completely! 1 hour later he then merges both queues together to speed things up. So, what was causing the delay? 1 man in security with no magnifying glasses or machinery going through liquids under 100ml looking for specific ingredients! What's worse! By the time we get to this point he's trying to chat up my wife! This is the worst airport i have transited in! Never again! The staff are rude and are not interested in helping/listening. They don't know what customer service is! nor how to operate an airport. There is a lot of learning that need to happen here. I highly recommend you don't transit through Amman if you don't want to lose your sanity.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Amman Queen Alia,airport,1 reviewsG Carter,3/16/2023,"We passed through this airport in transit twice, coming and going on a round trip. The airport appears modern, signage is okay. Bathrooms mixed on cleanliness. The worst part is passing though security. The first time through went reasonable well. It wasn't too crowded. But security was inconsistent. My wife had to give up her water bottle, mine made it though (full of water). All laptops had to be swabbed. Why? The second time through was chaos. There were too few staff and scanners. Passengers were cutting in line, there was no crow control or line barriers. It took about 30 minutes to get through. Security staff were, however, very helpful. We had lost an item (a book) on the first pass through, and three weeks later security had the item in the Lost and Found. We had to fill out considerable paperwork, show ID etc. to reclaim the paperback novel. But we did get it back. I would avoid this airport.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Amman Queen Alia,airport,C Larson,9/16/2022,The airport looks very futuristic and modern from the outside but the inside is total chaos. It really isn't big enough for the number of passengers wanting to check in. This is made worse by all the Royal Jordanian flights being in one giant queue waiting for a check in desk. Why isn't is possible to check in using the RJ App? Why don't they dedicated queues for each flight? The result was total chaos with a member of staff running up and down calling out the flight destinations to get the passengers out of the queue because the flight was starting to board. Once you get past the check-in and security there is massive of space for shops and restaurants. It seems the airport is more interested in making money than having enough space and desk so passengers can check in easily,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Once in the departure lounge area we sat for hours as our flight was delayed. We received no information and there was no electronic information board to provide us with updates. No verbal announcements either. We just sat. When we questioned airport staff, they had no more information than we did. This is not how a modern airport should run. In addition to this, there should be more affordable refreshments on sale as the airline (Turkmenistan Air) wasn't going to give us any. There should also be free WiFi for us to use our mobile phones. Other than that it was an OK airport. More cheap and drinks would help.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

The couple at the head of our line had a problem and it took 45 minutes for the lady to get the problem worked out! When we got in line, there were 6 people in line.

Anchorage,airport,Daniel Re,9/6/2014,The (south) domestic terminal in Anchorage is world class and beautiful. This new terminal is very modern spotlessly clean provides amenities expected at an international airport and offers a view of the surrounding mountains that is breathless. The displays of local wildlife native culture and art is unsurpassed by most airports in the world. However the old north terminal (which is now connected to the south terminal by a concourse) is sad. Anchorage is one of the five most busy airports in the world for international (cargo) airlines but not for international passenger service. The few international airlines that do provide passenger service (mostly during the summer months) are forced to use the north terminal as U.S. customs is located there. All the comments seen on this site are about the north terminal made by international travelers and are undoubtedly true. Wish they all could have been processed through the magnificent south building.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Ancona,airport,Stephen Smith,9/12/2022,"Very clean Airport, friendly helpful staff, great that it’s all on one level. My departure was late 11.00pm and was disappointed in the fact that the duty free shop was closed. Also it took a while for the cafe bar to open and I wanted a pizza slice heated up which the assistant was reluctant to do , but I said I would wait. When we got through passport control all seating was taped off so a huge bunch of passengers, and some sitting in the floor. No staff around for about 20 mins. Some passengers lifted up the tape to sit down so a majority followed only to be asked to move out 10 mins later. Also no Air conditioning so it was hot and sweaty. So I would say this Airport is not good for later flights.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Ankara,airport,Mohd Shabsog,6/3/2023,"During the midnight of 3rd/4th of June during a transit flight, I had the displeasure of dealing with a poorly coordinated security team. Under normal circumstances I would highly recommend this airport as I have traveled through it before. To put things in context, I was on a transit trip that had a 1 hour period between the departure of the arrival from the earlier destination and the departure of the subsequent flight. Given the time constraint, one would imagine there to be a better overall coordination among the staff. There was particularly poor coordination between those who worked at security checks and those at passport control. The staff at security checks not only allowed over 15 people to cut through the long queue sporadically without any consequence or moderation, they also performed unnecessary performative “passport checks” (granted we had already done actual complete passport around 5 meters earlier). A lot of the questions asked seemed performative as well, it seemed as if they were more interested in it the appearance of doing their job while simultaneously doing it at a slow pace without maintaining any sense of order. Thankfully, it did not cost me the flight but I would urge there to be better coordination in the future as I’m fully aware from previous experience that the staff at the airport can do better.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

There was also a little play area near our gate for our son. We hired a trolley from outside but there was nowhere to drop it off inside - you had to go out and then go back in via security so we just abandoned ours in the hall! Several other people had done the same and we saw someone gather them - a small thing that can be easily fixed. Security very fast and nice man on duty.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Antalya,airport,A Davies,8/31/2024,"Fairly straight forward on arrival but as others have said, departures is a bit of a joke. Very badly organised, zero aircon (probably to make you buy more drinks), massively over crowded with limited seating, no wifi, and the food and drink charges are utterly criminal. We paid £28 for 3x bags of chips from burger king. We also had 3x separate security checks including myself and 4yo boy being selected for ""random"" bag searches at the gate by possibly the most disinterested security team you'll ever witness.

Our flight to Glasgow was departing at 00:45, gate opened around 23:30. UK Government imposed searches are a problem, the caveman doing the searches seemed to enjoy it. Arrogant, aggressive, intimidating. Felt like he wanted a reaction from passengers. He cracked my phone's screen protector and emptied a females toiletries bag onto a table in front of everyone. Humiliating, 'I can do what I like and you can't do anything about it' attitude. Almost half the men on the flight got this treatment and if any of us met him under different circumstances.... At the departure gate there were around 300 seats, however half were cordoned off for some unknown reason. 150 seats were sat on while the other 100 or so passengers stood around us looking at the forbidden seats.

Antalya,airport,David Stewart,8/25/2024,"Arrival simple. Through immigration quickly as in most Turkish airports. Departures is a totally different story. It's not organised chaos just chaos. Totally third world. Check in a nightmare. Despite checking in online have to queue for paper boarding card. Next are the passport control lines. To be fair this is probably the quickest bit of the constant queues. Security next which is crazy. They're either talking to each other or screaming at some passenger. Duty free. This is like a endurance test. Incompetent isn't a strong enough description. After 25 minutes waiting due to some poor girl with obviously no experience I managed to get a supervisor who's first excuse was ""system problems"" which was a fairytale as she put the goods through right away. Lounge. An utter disaster of a place. Overbooked and they couldn't care less. Some Russian guy (employee!!) acting like a doorman in a sleazy nightclub outrageously deciding who could and couldn't get in. By this point I lost the plot and the only thing I was told by the lounge ""supervisor"" was that sometimes Russian people sound cheeky!!! I wasn't in Russia was in Turkey and expect even basic manners. After getting in there were numerous staff members from Fraport Technik and others enjoying coffees cigarettes and chatting but for passengers it's full????? Finally the extra security check at the gate is laughable. They do check some passengers but once boarding commences they just leave even although still about a third of the flight not even entered the gate area. All in all it's a horrendous place. Fraport should hang their heads in shame but they will never do anything about until the travelling public vote with their feet and go elsewhere unless there is a compelling need to be in AYT.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Random officials asked for our documents for no apparent reason and we fought off some very aggressive people wanting to assist with our luggage. Checking in was fairly chaotic, not helped by the lack of space. The ATMs worked and many people looked to be working hard to make this place function, but overall Ivato airport gives a dreadful first impression to anyone coming to Madagascar.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Antananarivo,airport,C Nelson,8/23/2016,"Madagascar is a wonderful country but Antananarivo airport is so poor that it really makes visiting a trial. For entry I counted that my passport was checked 6 times from leaving the aircraft until finally getting into our taxi. No idea why, but it took a long time. You must have the entry fee (around 25 euros per person for short stay) in cash (Euros, Dollar and Pounds accepted). If you don't, staff escort you landside to a cash point and bring you back. There are numerous stamps and writing and more queuing, all of which seems totally superfluous. People that look like staff often aren't and are the 'porters'. They are very aggressive - there's no point trying to take your own bag, unless it's strapped to you as they take it and then expect to be paid. It is also very difficult to keep it to just 1 porter, again expecting to be paid. I know it's a poor country, but some regulation of these porters is required, especially coming airside. I suppose overall, the time to clear wasn't that bad as they saved that for the exit. Again, there was the obsession with passport checks - 5 times it was checked, as well as my finger prints being taken - no idea why on exit, but not on entry. That wasn't the worst - our hotel delivered us 2 hours and 30 mins before the departure. We were about half way down the check-in queue. The plane had a capacity of 89 people. Checking-in took 2 hours. The cabin bags had labels too - not required in other locations. Some people seemed to have a check-in form, but we didn't need one. After that, then they said a form had to be filled-in, with lots of totally irrelevant information. Similar to the form on entry with info like where you stayed. The form wasn't available whilst you queued for check-in. Another member of staff then turned up, offering a pen and wanting to be paid - we had no currency left by then. Then there were more checks and the finger print scan. A baggage check until finally getting through to departures. By the time we got through, the plane was already boarding, so I didn't see the departure lounge. In the end the plane was 30 mins late departing due to these delays. Overall a really poor experience, which would be so easy to improve. My recommendation is to keep your bags close (not for security reasons), be very specific what help you need / want and for departures, be there 3 hours in advance.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Antananarivo,airport,Arnold DeVries,2/18/2016,"Antananarivo airport is pretty efficient overall however, if you are flying domestically be aware that there is only one shop with nothing other than some packaged snacks and water to buy after you go through security. Nothing landside either. Seats are all wood. International terminal - quickly whisked through the place as I had Sky Priority on Air France. Bit chaotic and had to navigate people who would just take your bags to ""help"" you along. Just say ""non merci"". There are shops beyond security to buy and spend your money in the International Terminal. AF Business Lounge was warm but a nice respite from the otherwise warm and wooden benched area to wait for departure. A lot of checking your bags and paperwork in both terminals. No jetways - need to walk up some fairly rickety stairs to the plane. Had toyed with the idea of killing a 15 hour layover there before a 2am AF departure, but was feeling sick so hit a hotel for a rest. Glad I did as it is not a airport to kill that much time.

No really worth going off site, or so we thought. Scarcely any seats and those available were not suitable for long delays, but nothing else was available. The tiny cafe closed about ten minutes after our arrival mid-afternoon. The excuse given was 'it's Sunday'. No water machine or vending machine available. The A/C worked over efficiently and it was bitterly cold. After an efficient check in and passage through normal airport procedures, enter into the departure area. This is large and open with the potential for many outlets and stores. However very few are in use, really no more than were in the original old terminal. We were told that rents are excessive and that is why few are in use. Prices were excessive - $8 for a small bottle of water.

Departure is rather chaotic you queue to check-in (about 20 minutes in our case) and to go through emigration (over 30 minutes) though security was cleared quickly. Once in the terminal it was crowded but had (just) enough seating. The snack bar was reasonably priced but souvenirs can be found cheaper elsewhere on the island. The good news (hopefully) is that the new terminal building is complete and due to open in the next few weeks according to locals it is much larger than the present one and looks a better design - there are several dedicated piers for large aircraft.

As of late 2015 this situation has changed, however, as all the parking areas have been enclosed and high charges imposed for parking.

The final time my husband and I saw it happen, which was opened, literally, just behind us, we snuck through too while said employee was busy looking for others (of their choosing) to go through. We were fast tracked through customs in minutes. We had not eaten before because we thought 3 1/2 hours in small airport would have left plenty of time to eat at a restaurant in the airport. Nope, I barely had time to get aunt Annie’s (while my husband used that time to take a quick trip to the bathroom, I had to use airplane toilet).

Then you queue at the cash desk which can take a lot of time to hand over the money and the tourist tax (which everyone has to pay so this line is the busiest), once done with that back to the visa desk to get the documents back (the cashier desk only accept USD some people had euros which caused some delays. They have to be post 2003 clean and crisp otherwise they won't accept it). They have fingerprint scanners which sometimes work or not. Then immigration which the guy was lovely and was very welcoming, one of the best immigration experiences I have had in a while. Your passport gets checked again before going down the escalator which has an amazing green hand rail. Luggage was waiting for me then go through customs and have passport checked again to leave.

There are a few shops but none of those annoying overpriced boutiques which is a good thing! Wifi appeared to work.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Astana,airport,4 reviewsAlan Sargeant,10/23/2019,"I arrived in Nur Sultan Airport from Novosibirsk, Russia and left to go to Almaty. The Immigration control was quite fast and no problems in getting a 15 day Visa on arrival. The airport is relatively new and modern. Security was efficient and effective. I had a couple of hours between flights and wanted to recharge phone and computer. There was plenty of seating but there were very few places and none adjacent to a seat where I could charge my computer. I watched it from about 10 metres away. The airport has all the things that interest some people - money exchange, tourist souvenirs etc. I seldom shop in airports.",NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Astana,airport,E Alter,9/29/2018,"This airport while still considered fairly new is still so very basic. The upstairs 3rd floor so called food court is a joke. The food is so basic, stale & expensive for what you get. With their limited English it makes it harder also. 3 of the places were on a break but still had limited menu. This food court needs a fast food outllet like most international airports. Most staff were friendly but facilities while clean are basic.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Astana,airport,1 reviewsK Singh,9/29/2018,The airport is quite small but well maintained. There is no drinking water facilities for passengers. A 500ml bottle of water at this airport costs 1 euro.

There were hardly any English announcements.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Astana,airport,8 reviewsMaarten Caspers,12/23/2016,"Astana is a small international airport, that is well connected to Europe via Frankfurt, London, Paris and Amsterdam through Kazakhstan's Air Astana. The airport has only one terminal for Domestic and International flights. A new terminal is being constructed next to the existing facility which is planned to be opening in spring 2017. The arrivals and baggage reclaim is small. Immigration quite smooth and officers were friendly, but remember to fill in your immigration card with a blue or black pen, not with a red one as it is not accepted. I had almost no queues. Taxi pick-up at the terminal is not well-organised and taxi recruiters can be annoying. The central hall for departures is quite spacious and there is sufficient seating around the check-in area. Check-in areas are small and somewhat old-fashioned, but work fine. Friendly ground staff. Short queuing time at check-in, passport control and security. Emigration passport control is fine. There are few F&B and retail facilities at the international departure gates. There is plenty of seating at the end of the concourse close to the small cafe in the back. Transferring between international flights is quick and easy. Passengers do not have to pass immigration, only security screening. It took me only 5-10 minutes from arrival gate to departure gate. F&B and retail facilities are limited, especially in the departure are after immigration. Food choice is limited. Very good wifi while waiting for check-in or for your flight. Password can be obtained via SMS. Terminal and toilets are clean. Remote arrivals and departures (via bus) in winter when temperatures can go below -20 Celsius can be cold and slippery, but also a very interesting experience. When the new terminal will be opened in 2017 I assume less aircraft will be handled via busses.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Astana,airport,Alibek Taizhanov,7/31/2013,Astana airport is small but very good. The staff is ok. The wifi connection works pretty well queuing times are very short.

Astana,airport,M Foote,9/5/2011,This airport has excellent free wifi but lacks any decent shops or restaurants. I stayed in the airport for 5 hrs whilst waiting for a connecting flight. The check-in agent wouldn't check my bag through so I was stuck at the airport. The best area for wifi is on the 2nd floor. There are power-points behind the bench seats for charging your laptop. Airside there are small shops and a cafe/bar at the very end of the departure lounge where the wifi doesn't work. As a capital city airport it is lacking in many of the things one would expect. Without the wifi it would be very hard to pass the time waiting for connecting flights.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Asuncion Silvio Pettirossi,airport,Dale Hancock,1/27/2006,The Asuncion terminal is small – perhaps half a dozen gates. Arrival was simple – though the plane had to stop short of the jet way lower the cabin door / stairs then taxi up to the jetway (TAM uses Fokker jets). Through passport control with no issues. While waiting for the baggage to be unloaded we were “found” by a rep from the Hotel Excelsior (the $110/nt suite included pick-up & drop-off at the airport). He helped us through the customs line (though the help certainly wasn’t needed) then on to the outside world where another contact with our name awaited. I asked about money exchange (zero Guarani for tips) & the initial contact took us over to a Hertz booth where we exchanged money. Most likely not the best rate. In retrospect the first contact was probably a local minion with the ability to get through to the Customs area & pass himself off as our legitimate contact all for a little “propina” which he was not hesitant to ask for once we got to our car. For departure we left the hotel at 4:30 AM for our 6:00 AM flight arriving with just less than an hour before flight time. No problems. TAM was efficient this time (see report under SCL) and check-in was completed in 10 minutes or less. Then on to the airport tax window – to the left of the check-in counters & to the right of the entry for passport control. $25 US p/p departure tax. The lady didn’t have US dollar change so we paid $310000 Guarani – probably not a very good rate but it allowed us to leave the country with essentially zero local currency. Through the departure doors & the lady immediately to the left verifies you’ve paid your taxes & stamps the receipt. Then to the immigration officer. Again no problems. In the gate area with 30 minutes to spare. Harp music playing free drinks (coffee soda water) at a little TAM kiosk. Restrooms are difficult to find – to the right of gate 2. It’s 5:30 in the morning and a few of the duty-free (mostly local craft) shops are actually open. For such a poor country with limited resources ASU appears to be surprisingly well managed and efficient.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,R Bayle,3/6/2025,Worst airport experience ever. It’s always awful coming here but this was the absolute worst. This was just a layover from Charleston to Phoenix. We landed at the gate and sat there for 30 minutes. We were told “we have no idea why we are not allowed to park at the gate”. They refused to let us off the plane. We called customer support pleading with them to hold off our second flight. They refused. We showed up 1 minute after timed departure and the plane was gone. They were no help with booking a hotel or assisting with finding solutions. Completely their fault we missed the plane. We were here 30 minutes before departure and they refused to let us get off the plane.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,R Riley,12/15/2024,"We flew into Atlanta on a Delta flight from Paris with a connection (from Atlanta) to Orlando. Once off the plane it was easy to get to and complete passport control. However, all required interactions/processes beyond passport control were chaotic, loud, noisy, and rude. Specifically, - Part of the CBP process requires international arrival passengers to claim and then recheck luggage (if connecting). We waited at the assigned and posted carousel for over 30 minutes and then heard an unidentified person (employee?) yell out the bags for our flight were coming up two baggage claim carousels at the same time. How are passengers expected to know bags are coming in on the assigned carousel AND another carousel not posted for the flight? - After picking up checked bags, there was no posted guidance as to where to go or what to do. We rounded a turn and three separate airport employees were yelling three different sets of directions. One said to get into a particular line/queue but said nothing about checked luggage drop off. So we got in line. A separate employee came over yelling that our checked bags needed to be dropped across the room...no signage identified this and the only direction was to get in the line...so how would we know? - After sorting out the checked baggage drop, we went to another line for a security checkpoint. At the beginning of the line some unidentifiable airport employee was standing off to the side talking with people and it was not at all obvious she had anything to do with the security screening process. So, we proceeded into the line where other passengers were waiting. The employee then yelled something rude at my wife who was ahead of me. I asked the rude employee what she wanted. She said ""open your passports to the photo page."" So while fumbling with my passport and holding my carry-on, I asked ""why, the line is so backed up it will be 30 minutes until we get into the security checkpoint?"" The obnoxious rude employee then said ""you'll need to step aside"" and continued her side conversation with others. She then blurted out to other passengers ""ya'll can pass him by, I don't know what he be doing."" So the employee wanted people to open the passport but she was not looking at the passports and further did not appear to be in any way part of security, TSA, etc. Her uniform resembled cleaning crew. To make this worse, after opening the passports, the next employee just before the security checkpoint was instructing passengers to put the passports back in the bags with other items to clear security screening. -The security screening process was simple enough but employees were yelling with no clue that multiple people yelling means few instructions are understood and passengers are offended by their interaction. In a nutshell, many of the employees in Atlanta stand around barking instructions that cannot be understood. Many of these people should be replaced with signs like most modern airports have. Once beyond passport control Atlanta seems to have few signs or posted instructions as to what is required when arriving on an international flight with a domestic connection. Other airports around the world are far better at informing passengers and in my experience are less likely to be yelling at people like they are herds of cattle. Many employees at the Atlanta airport are unnecessarily rude if asked any questions or if asked to repeat whatever they are yelling. Avoid Atlanta if possible!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,J Clark,12/3/2024,"My wife and I, both senior citizens, arrived to the airport Wednesday, 11//27/24 around 825pm on Southwest Airlines flight. My wife required a wheelchair. There was a shortage of staff to assist with the wheelchair, therefore I offered to push the chair to pick up our baggage. While backing my wife into the tramway/train the doors closed on my wife's legs and would not reopen. Thankfully there were a couple of young male passengers who assisted me pry the doors open to free my wife before the train took off. As soon as we got my wife in, the doors closed and the train began to move, jerking and stopping several times before finally began to move at a normal pace. We were so nervous after this event it was hard to even continue to the baggage claim. Asked a few employees for directions and they were not very helpful. Finally one young lady employee was able to pointed us in the right direction. with a smile. One would think the train doors would have sensors that would open the doors if someone was trapped between them and would not allow them to close. I still have visions of what would have happened if my wife had gotten hurt or the train would have moved while my wife was trapped between the doors.

When I tell you those women spoke so bad to us I was in disbelief! They get away with it because we are on limited time and can’t risk missing our flights. It’s so bad you want to come 8 hours early just so you have a moment to ask to speak to someone higher because it’s so bad they deserve to know the disrespect the travelers that help pay their salaries are just sick of it! I travel too much to be spoken to or watch other people be spoken to like dogs! Never in any airport in this country or outside of this country have I come across the sheer disrespect I have in Atlanta! If it were easier to drive to a whole other state to leave from I would.

We stood in the queue for ages missed our connecting flight. Delta were extremely helpful and provided a hotel and voucher for dinner and breakfast. As for immigration staff they were so unprofessional, unhelpful and refused to listen to our request for some support and advice to travel onto our connecting flight. There should have been clear communication between Virgin and Atlanta Airport to ensure that customers could progress onto their connecting flights, a service should have been implemented to ensure this happened effectively within immigration from planning to support from immigration staff. Looking at other reviews for Atlanta airport many well travelled people are saying it's one of their worst experiences, I would agree. Please support customers to connect to their flights and review your current systems as they don't work and offer training to immigration staff to help, advise instead of telling them to get back in the queue.

So if a US, Korean or New Zealand citizen arrives at the airport 45 minutes after I do, they will still be passing security check before I do, what kind of discrimination is this? At least we should have our own security queue. The suffering didn’t end there, we had to queue for 30 minutes in security control queue, and because I travel a lot for work, I knew the procedure, i took out my laptop from the bag, but, surprisingly, my tray was sent for manual checking, by the way, almost 50% of the bags went to manual check, that is another 15 minutes queue wait, and when it was my turn the inspector didn’t even touch the bag like what she did with the others, where she frisked all of them, she told me that I’m good and nothing is wrong here - why did you make me wait 15 minutes then?

Auckland,airport,P Hayward,2/3/2025,"The worst international airport in the world. We arrived back in NZ after three years away to this mess and national embarrassment. The confusion starts after Customs at the bottom of stairs before baggage claim where two people are yelling at you to go two different ways based on if you are declaring something. The baggage claim belts are so close to the bio security lanes that there is no room to get bags. We then thought we were doing the right thing by declaring items (what a mistake). Waited nearly an hour for someone to put a sticker on passport then went into another queue and waited the same only to be put in a different queue again and cleared (same as if we hadn’t declared!) Overall it took us over 2 hrs after landing to clear the international terminal and we missed the bag drop time to our domestic flight so had to run with 6 suitcases to the domestic terminal and just caught our connecting flight by 5 minutes. Extremely stressful, disappointing, and frustrating from a frequent traveler who has seen how great other airports around the world n make it work.

When we got there, we were told our domestic flight was 1.15 hours late but there is no signage at the international terminal about domestic flights.

Ayers Rock,airport,J Teale,9/6/2024,"I was recently on a return flight from Uluru after four days at Sails in the Desert celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary. I am unable to proceed through regular screening as I have a cardiac loop recorder implanted in my left breast and have had a total right hip replacement. I indicated this when asked as I loaded my cabin luggage on the conveyor belt and was directed to the alternative screening process. I was screened with the usual procedure, then pat down. That’s expected. I could see my implant & prosthesis clearly on the screen. Then the young lady asked me to rub both hands back & forward in my groin - no idea why at this stage. Then my hands were scanned with a detector. “None detected” was the result on screen. It then occurred to me that I am being screened for secreting drugs in my private parts. The young lady then advises me that I need to proceed to a room for a personal body search. I must have looked quite incredulous as a senior officer came, pointed to the screen and advised the young lady that it was indeed a hip prosthesis and allowed me to proceed. I’m still traumatised and flabbergasted at such poor training. With 230,000 annual visitors to Uluru I find it beyond belief that this young lady has never seen what a hip replacement looks like on screen. My orthopaedic surgeon provided me with a certificate of proof of hip replacement but assured me that it wasn’t necessary for me to carry this when travelling due to the high numbers of passengers with hip and knee replacements and airport staff are very familiar with these prostheses. Needless to say that that experience certainly took away from the anniversary celebrations. Jetstar’s “complaints” procedure are so cumbersome and, I believe, designed to put you off. I made three attempts to notify Jetstar of such poor training but each time I had to wait to “speak” to an online chat bot - all three dropped out. Won’t be going back unfortunately, although it was a beautiful place which I hope I can look back, reflect on and enjoy after I get over this trauma.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Previously it was next to the massive sandstone monolith known as Uluru or Ayers Rock. The old airport was on tribal sacred land and hence the relocation. The new airport is about 20 mins from the township of Yulura. It is a small airport taking in modern short-haul passenger jets. We arrived in good time but our flight was delayed by 60 minutes. The small terminal was getting crowded with passengers for other flights. There was not enough seating and many waiting passengers had to stand.

The airport is built on the edge of the desert and is surrounded by picturesque desert panorama. Being tourist orientated all sorts of tourist services were available immediately upon retrieval of baggage.

Security was fast, although once you pick up your try, there is no proper place where to put it, only some very low benches. Passport control was fast. Inside the boarding area there are 3 gates. Again very close to each other, with no clear indications. Not enough seating area for everyone, extremely crammed space. One small DF, one small bar and a vending machine, plus an indoor smoking area. Once boarding commenced, one announced was made indicating the gate, although on the gate screen the previous destination was not changed.

Bacau,airport,A Dron,7/20/2013,Probably the smallest airport I have experienced. On arrival distance between the entry doors from the apron to the immigration desks can not be more than 5 yards. This means that passengers have to queue outside which in inclement weather must be unpleasant. Passport checks were fast however. On departure similarly tiny landside area with minuscule cafe to left of entrance doors. Incredibly cramped check-in/security area to right of doors although check-in agent friendly and helpful. Security checks are very thorough - had to remove belt watch etc and they found small jar of jam I'd absent-mindedly packed in my carry-on bag. Departure lounge was standing room only for a single Boeing 737. Couple of vending machines are the only refreshment sources. Local people told us that a major expansion of the airport is planned but from look of abandoned foundations beside the existing terminal this is unlikely to be completed any time soon. In short staff seem fine but can not recommend because of lack of space and facilities - even allowing for the fact it's a regional airport not a major hub.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

But scratch all that cause that is not the actual reason why this airport sucks the posterior like an industrial grade vacuum pump drawing water in the centre of the Sahara desert during the hottest day of a drought caused by divine retribution. The reason why this airport is totally annoying is because the ground staff have no idea how to provide service. No clue whatsoever. It's as if these airline companies purposefully choose their worst dolts to represent them in the most unprofessional way possible. They think of themselves as some celebrities who are entitled to your subservience since they work at the airport. It's like a really really bad joke. You wonder what is going on in the their minds while the try their utmost to make your life harder in whatever way possible.

Bagdogra,airport,1 reviewsAnna Whyte,3/30/2019,"I have nightmares about this airport. To call it an international airport is a bad joke. I flew through 2 times in March, the first to take the helicopter service to Gangtok. The 2nd to fly back to Delhi T3 with Vistara, accompanied by my 20 year old son. I have a traumatic brain injury which means, essentially, that I am extremely sensitive to noise and crowds. Most airports have facilities that support this, 1st class check in, fast track security and lounges. Bagdogra ""International"" Airport has none of these facilities. Last year, before Vistara flew to Bagdogra I flew Air India and managed to ask other passengers to help me through security and then sat on the floor in a corner facing the wall for 2 hours shaking with sound cancelling headphones. Then didn't leave my hotel in Delhi for 2 days as I had to recover. 2019: Trip 1 in March with the helicopter to Gangtok: The staff pushed us to the front of the totally chaotic security queue. There were not enough boxes so the security staff were just dumping everyone's hand luggage/laptops/mobiles/electrical items in big piles and throwing the boxes back at each other. My son reported that a passenger was hit in the head by a badly aimed box. As we had only 2 women passengers for the helicopter and a person helping us, we managed. 2nd time: Bagdogra-Delhi Vistara. I had a panic attack outside the terminal and luckily we were flying Vistara as we were seated in the managers office until final call and then escorted through security by the professional Vistara staff. The staff at this airport are the most unprofessional I have encountered in 30+ years of travelling. While I was vomiting outside the terminal (in a trash can) from a panic attack a security guard with ""trainee"" on his jacket threatened to remove me until the police intervened and sent him away. My hand luggage, a computer bag with laptop and camera was forcibly removed from me by the guy X-raying hand luggage as he said it was too heavy. By this time, my son took over and the Vistara staff took me to the managers office as I was shaking and had Aphasia. My bag weighed 8 kilos (I have luggage weights) and I had a 10 kilo hand luggage allowance. I could go on. This airport is noisy, horrible and disorganised. Departing passengers sit on the floor waiting for their flights as there are not enough hard metal seats. Security is a nightmare (Watch out for flying plastic boxes). The staff x-raying the bags have no idea what they are doing. As I have a disability, I always fly a premium airline, now Vistara, so unfortunately, there is no alternative if you go to Sikkim. I feel sorry for the competent airline staff who work in this sorry excuse for an airport. Thank you Vistara Airline for your professional help in what must be an awful working environment.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Baku,airport,45 reviewsDiogo Freitas,1/27/2024,I paid 7 times more the normal rate to go from this airport to the city center. There are no ATMs on arrivals nor SIM cards shops. Your option is to accept the rides from the men who pest the arrivals area. They even have electronic terminals inside their taxis for you to pay by card their immensely overpriced rides. They are very well organized. Be very careful and smarter than me. Arrive with money of the country and call a Bolt or Uber by connecting to the airport WiFi.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Baku,airport,S Sher,6/22/2021,"I had a few issues with this airport. The first issue was as soon as I entered the terminal after the initial security check. They had 4 hands-free sanitizer dispensers right on the other side of security and not a single one of them worked. I asked the security guard about it and he just shrugged and said they don't work. Thankfully I carry my own hand sanitizer with me wherever I go so I was able to sanitize my hands. After that I went to check in for my flight. I had extra baggage fees that I needed to pay, which I already anticipated. They have one location that you pay for all excess baggage fees. They were working extremely slowly and they were not able to accept an international VISA, MasterCard, or Discover Card. All of them had travel plans on the cards so it had nothing to do on my side. They only accepted credit cards local to Azerbaijan. For being an international airport, this should be an option to pay with an international credit card. Then, as I looked for more sanitizer stations, they had many posted throughout the airport. I found at least 8 more after I went through security. Not a single on worked. During COVID, this should be one of the priority items to help minimize the spread of COVID at an International airport. They did not have a single working sanitizer dispenser in the entire airport. Then, because of the issue with them taking so long to pay for the extra baggage fees, I needed to quickly get to my departing gate because they didn't open the check-in process until two hours before departure instead of the three hours for an international flight that they are supposed to. I went to the security check I was accustomed to use and I was then told after I got up there that that security checkpoint was not open and I had to enter through the other side of the airport. There were zero signs showing that the security checkpoint was closed. Normally this wouldn't be so big of an issue, but because of the delays with paying for the extra baggage, the plane had already started boarding and I didn't have much time. My family and I had to run to the other side of the airport to go through the other security. This airport is not very large, but it still takes a little time to get from one side to the other, especially when you are already late because of delays that were beyond our control. We were at the airport four hours early and almost missed our flight because of all of these combined issues that were out of our control, the security being shut down without notice, the excessive delays with the baggage, and them opening up check in 2 hours before flight departure instead of 3 that is stated. This was a very frustrating and bad experience at the airport and much of it would have been eliminated if they just had these things in place that are common sense.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Baku,airport,Zeeshan Shah,12/27/2019,My first visit to Baku Heydar Aliyev Airport and was pleasantly surprised in many ways and disappointed in a few others. The airport has very striking architecture and is not very large but easy to navigate. The design is very interesting as it has three levels with the departure level on the this floor. The number of high end shops at an international airport of this size surprised me. The airport is about 20 minutes to 25 minutes from downtown Baku by car. They do have a bus service and plans to extend the Baku Metro to the airport sometime in the future. Now for the disappointing parts. It took quite some time for the luggage to arrive at the carousel at 2:00 am even though my flight was the only one at the airport. Also immigration coming and going took an inordinate amount of time with someone with an American passport. In some ways it looked like they had not even seen an American passport before! And the security check leaving was very overzealous bordering on Soviet like. They confiscated my luggage scale from my carry on even though I protested that it was went through American security!,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Baku,airport,B Cooper,10/3/2019,"The airport is clean and looks great. However, it is let down badly by the circus that you have to put up with if you are a transit passenger who needs to pick up a boarding pass on arrival. I had a 3.5 hour layover in GYD traveling back from Aktau. The staff could not/would not print me off a boarding pass until 1.5 hours before my connection, leaving me stranded in a holding room. I had booked with AZAL, but because it was a codeshare with Turkish Airlines, this made them less helpful! The airport really needs to get with the times and move the check-in area into the main airport transit area. It makes zero sense preventing people from accessing this area and stinks of a computer says no attitude.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Baltimore Washington,airport,C Horten,8/30/2024,"This is the second time I write about this airport. Last time it was about TSA and this time this passenger passed through quickly without any delay to to my disability. However when the plane touched down after a day of travel this passenger decided to wait at the aiport overnight. Well, after overnighting at the SFO, I thought this would be just an ordinary thing. However my night at Baltimore Washington Airport was so miserable that I must record several warnings. 1) All the eateries and cafes are closed by 11pm 2) The workers are about as friendly and responsible as formerly at greyhound 3) hourly wage mentality prevalent, so whatever is not spelled out in the handbook is okay, including for instance having ground crew workers on break purposely sitting by visitor repeatedly. 4) actually the supervision is so loose that the people going in and out of gate doors to the tarmac/cargo holding area can be wearing any ID. The guy that was eying me at Terminal C had an ID badge but he was taking a lot more breaks than a job allows. 5) all the workers seem to take a lot of breaks and sit around throughout the terminals talking, even socializing like at Terminal A. 6) At terminal C, while I was quietly sitting and napping the red-alarm bell on the ceiling at the gate went off ""by itself' several times. It also did that at the gate across where I was sitting. The alarm went on-and-off ""by itself"" four times at least, and each time, when I was sort of dozing off. I had commented to myself that the music was objectionable, and they ""changed the music to soft jazz."" So evidently the security was looking and listening to me throughout my stay, since obviously very few passengers stay here during the early morning hours. 6) When I walked to Terminal A (where I hoped there would be no alarms) the security speaker announced my last name and terminal location and that security was ""on it."" So apparently even though I am an older disabled person with no record or history of vagrancy or crime, the airport security were ""alert to my whereabouts"" to the point of announcing my last name and location so all the workers could hear. 7) At Terminal A, another ground crew again tried again to sit nearby during his ""break."" When I sort of had enough of this and was muttering to myself, that evidently was shared with some cleaning staff, and two burly janitors (twins) who were heading to clean one of the men bathrooms in Terminal A loudly and repeatedly jeered at me. ""Why does she have to keep moving around that ch*nk as if they was after her?"" that kind of thing. 8) At Terminal B it was quieter because by 4am I found of group of nonwhites who were sitting in a section. However again, another ID-badge worker tried to sit near by while I was napping. 9) Workers were also resting or napping in the food-hall area. As a consequence even though the food-halls and other shops look very attractive, I will not have any desire to eat here. 10) The nice thing about this was that while there were no formal guards questioning anyone, there are apparently enough ""night crew"" who keep going in and out of gate-doors (plus the other hidden cameras and mics) that they don't need them. The strange thing is it was hard to tell who was actually a hired worker and a part-timer with a badge who just sits around and tries to harass visitors. This is obviously why unlike at the SFO or LAX nobody wants to overnight here, period.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Baltimore Washington,airport,M Walker,1/3/2024,"My adult daughter had just returned from her connection in Las Vegas to Baltimore Airport in route to her final home destination in Maryland. My daughter had difficulty locating her car and had gotten on the wrong airport bus. Now normally this is frustrating for anyone, but my daughter is autistic so trying to problem solve while in a heightened emotional state is a big struggle for her. Morgan is higher functioning and prides herself on how independent she is, but after a night of flying across country and running to connection flights, she was feeling defeated and concerned about finding her vehicle as the sun was going down. A bus driver named Chris on bus 407 was her guardian angel. He went out of his way to get her to the correct bus before it got dark when the main office confirmed they were too swamped to assist. He even had to deal with an angry traveler yelling at him for taking the extra time of getting Morgan to the correct bus connection although Morgan said he was very efficient and quickly navigated her to the correct destination.

Baltimore Washington,airport,S Kaylen,12/29/2023,"After arriving at BWI Airport around 5 PM from Detroit, I had to wait for two hours after touchdown for the handlers to begin bringing out the luggage and my suitcase was not among those that arrived. Upon enquiry at the Lost Luggage room, I was told that the plane was too heavy, so my suitcase (which was not anywhere near being overweight) had been randomly selected to be rerouted (thrown off the plane) to another airport. It would therefore now arrive at 10 PM from Chicago Midway. So I was given two choices: wait at the airport till 10 PM for my bag to arrive, or go home and wait ""two days"" for them to ""Overnight"" the bag to me via FedEX.  Really, how much extra fuel would it take for my normal-weight suitcase to be included in the original flight? I opted for the former option and prepared to settle in for a three-hour vigil at the BWI airport. At 10 PM I was at the conveyor belt that ground staff said I should stand at to wait for my suitcases. They said the plane would be 12 minutes late. And so I waited. Eventually another showed up. She was there to pick up her elderly mother who was on that plane from Chicago. She expressed concern as it was the first time her mother was flying using a walker. I would periodically check with ground crew if I was really standing at the right place. They always replied with the same thing: when the suitcases start arriving from Chicago they would be at belt 3. But it wasn't until well after 11 PM that I saw the belt I should be standing it was now Belt 4. The ground crew had not bothered to tell me about the change, even though I was standing near their desk and in regular conversation with them. The bags started rolling in and by 11:43 PM I was finally able to retrieve my suitcase. When I questioned the ground crew about the delay, they were very defensive and said that it wasn't as late as I thought because it took a long time for the plane to reach a gate, and they count the delay from the moment it does so. So there you are. This was my unplanned adventure on December 27. I hope your experience with Southwest Airlines and the BWI Airport is better than mine has been of late.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,Mike Rowe,1/15/2019,"A small but tidy airport, adequate for short transits. The security/x-ray procedures for transit can be time consuming if more than one flight arrives at once. Expect an hour of queueing to get through the security. If you have a short connection staff will call you out of the normal queue just in time for your flight. For longer transits there is nothing to do in the airport and little food. The only coffee shop airside was closed in December. A transit visa is available on arrival (for AU) and costs $BN5. Money exchange is near the immigration area and easy. Meter taxis are supposed to be available but on my 10pm arrival none were available, unmetered all charge $BN20 for even the shortest trip. On my return the next morning the hotel booked me a car for $20. Overall a transit stop in a budget hotel adds $AU100 to your trip. Unfortunately the new schedule with Royal Brunei (since Oct 18) now require long stopovers and overnight transit in Brunei when connecting to SEA destinations and this now makes other more expensive airlines a more attractive option. ""Dry"" flights and inconsistent alcohol rules may also influence travellers. Immigration staff are slow, poorly organized and lazy, Visa stamps tend to take up a full passport page where they could use only a third like other countries. This trip was 50 minutes waiting at immigration. Business Class lounge is quiet and comfortable for short stops. Has shower facilities but nowhere to sleep. Food is hit and miss depending on time of day and number of guests. No alcohol in the lounge. An airport to be tolerated rather than enjoyed.

There are ATM machines, a baggage sealing service and currency exchange stand (but they never have Singapore dollars). Check in was a breeze, done in several minutes. Passport control is quick. Once you enter the departure lounge, to the right is a food court that sells food to order (manly Asian dishes). There is a convenience store, some stores that sell traditional Bruneian foods and watch / perfume stores. I was told more stores will be added soon. The waiting area has good lighting, there are priority seats near the gate for those with young children and elderly people. The toilets were clean. There is a prayer room for Muslim travellers. On arrival there is a short walk to customs and immigration. Separate counters for local, ASEAN, Diplomatic and foreigners. There are plenty of trolleys at the baggage carousel.

Bandung,airport,F Lakana,9/26/2019,"Bandung Airport is a quaint airport in the middle of the city (used to be the HQ of. Indonesia’s domestic aircraft industry, meanwhile non-existing). It served a number of domestic and international destinations and was a real asset to the city. Then the government decided to build a grand new airport in Majalenka, about 60 or so kilometres north of Bandung, which had to cater for a growing population in the Bandung area and East Jakarta. It was opened pretty much on schedule, which is rare in Indonesia, but in the middle of nowhere; far away from current populations and with poor connections. Since no airlines wanted to move there, the government forced the move of 56 domestic flights from Bandung to the new Kertajati airport. This included the popular Bandung- Bali routes. The result is that it now takes longer to get to the new airport (about 3 hours), than it actually takes to fly to Bali. Some people now prefer to drive all the way to Jakarta, for more choice and cheaper flights. Efforts are made to reinstate some domestic flights in Bandung, but that does not include the Bali route for the time being. Overall, such a shortsighted decision to move all these flights from Bandung to Majalenka.:.

There is a security check for both international and domestic passengers before the check-in, and another one at the entrances to the international and domestic departure halls. Checks were quick and cleared the immigration checkpoint in less than a minute. Apparently most of the shops after the security area are in the domestic departure hall. The new international departure hall consists of only one gate (Gate 3i), a tiny magazine stand, a kids playground and a food kiosk that looks more like a mini warehouse. There is free wi-fi to keep people occupied, charging points for mobile phones, as well as plenty of seats. Since there are few international flights the international departure area doesn't feel crowded. As the airport is tiny there are no aerobridges, so you have to walk to the plane rain or shine. While this can be annoying for some, it is pretty great for aviation enthusiasts (you can get really close to planes that are taxiing to the runway).

Bangalore,airport,1 reviewsBruce Lyman,8/27/2024,"The new international terminal is a nice building but the traveller experience was awful. I should add it was not just our experience but the same as others caught in the same ridiculous situation. We had arrived via a domestic flight (Indigo) which was seven hours before our international departure. We were bused to the new international terminal and told we could not enter the building because our flight didn't open for another four hours. The expectation was that we would wait on the kerb where there are no amenities, for four hours. Bureaucratic nonsense and bad experience one. After pressing the security staff we were eventually allowed into the ticketing foyer. But we were not allowed into the terminal proper and had to wait there for four hours where there are no amenities for transiting passengers. We had boarding passes for our international connections but were not allowed into the airport proper where we could make use of cafes and the lounges and bathrooms. Bad experience two - waiting in a hall not designed for waiting passengers. And not just ourselves but numerous other transit passengers as well. A nice building let down but business processes that make no sense. Worse, when I attempted to email management (feedback emails advertised everywhere) they blamed the airlines for not aligning their flights! That was really poor form.

Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,airport,E Malton,6/30/2024,"Great airport, but it is huge and can take up to 25 minutes to get from gate to gate if in transit. Good variety of shops and restaurants, lots of toilets which are always clean. It's a shame there's no areas to relax apart from at gates. Singapore, Doha, KL etc all have sofa areas and big TV's to watch, which is great when you have a long lay over. I always thought there were smoking rooms here, but weren't. Not an issue if you have a lay over of more than 5hrs as you can go through immigration and leave the airport. I did, however, find cigarette butts behind floor standing AC units on two occasions at un-manned gates, where passengers and probably staff hide and have a quick smoke. I even smelt cigarette smoke at one point, so people obviously are smoking in the terminals. Some staff seemed quite unhelpful and stand-offish though when I asked about a few things, but mainly young ones who were more interested in what was on their mobile phones.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

I had a single razor shaver in my toiletry bag and they made me remove the blade in my razor and they let me pass with an entire cartridge of replacement blades in the same toiletry bag. This is the only airport that I have been to that makes travellers remove a single razor blade from the razor.

Bangor,airport,Vitaliia Tomakhiv,7/27/2023,"Always loved this airport, but, unfortunately, not this time. I am flying frequently from 2017 and I am aware of what can be brought in carry-on baggage and in what sizes. Officers at the bag control opened my bag and threw out all the bottles (each of which were exactly 100 ml). When I told “But it is 100 ml, it is allowed”, they answered “We allow under 100 ml”. I have never heard this before during 7 years of traveling. I have been traveling through all the world and it always have been 100 ml limit for liquid item in carry-on. I went to website of the airlines, and the airport and each sections clearly states “items do not have to EXCEED 100 ml” or “liquid cannot be larger than 100 ml”. I brought these items from another country and that supposed to be gifts for my friends. It is not something I can buy in the US. No gifts, no mood. Thank you Bangor airport. Firstly, I suggest to know the rules and educate yourself prior to violating passengers’ rights",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bangor,airport,K Ashley,7/9/2012,There was one person in the whole airport who knew what was going on. The rest of them were rude and clue less. We missed our flight because they had 2 people working a very thorough security screening for a line of at least 120 passengers. It took them so long that we missed our flight along with about 6 other people. They are incredibly understaffed. They ended up costing us nearly $300 extra to rebook our flight and didn't offer to pay for a hotel or anything. Be thorough at security but have the staff to handle the passengers. They also claim they called everyone's names over the intercom. Not a single person heard their name. They said at first that we would not be able to leave until Monday (two days later) and that all flights were booked. Luckily two people cancelled on a flight for the next day and we were able to board. It was a nightmare to say the least.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Banjul,airport,30 reviewsD Sarzen,4/13/2023,"First of all, plan on leaving very early as the road to the airport is always congested, after that being said, be prepared for some hassle. First you need to line up in order to pay a 20 USD or equivalent ""Development tax"", then the airline ""security"" will photograph your passport and all the stamps/visa in it, then you will be allowed to check in. After that, you will need to clear immigration, be prepared to have people jumping the queue in front of you and no one will say anything. Some officers want you to fill the departure form, others will let you go without it. Security line is fast as long as you do not have computers etc... inside the carry on. Do not shop in foreign currency at the duty free or you will be ripped off, if you need to exchange your last dalasis, you will be able to, but they will give you lots of coins, which for me was just fine. Blackouts are common at this airport, just saying. Boarding is chaotic, they do not respect the classes or groups, anything goes. People needing wheelchair will literally be carried by 3-4 men from the tarmac to the plane and be prepared to tip. The only thing that worked fine in here believe it or not was the WiFi, it was free and fast.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Banjul,airport,Val Theobalds,8/28/2021,"Getting through the departure area at Banjul airport The Gambia to get to the UK is beyond ridiculous. 1) Firstly when you arrive to the airport you have to queue and weigh your luggage outside of the airport on scales. 2) You then proceed to pay 1000GMD PP departure tax about £16 at another area 3) You are then shown to the first check in point where you need to show the following, Covid test vaccination proof for the UK. Evidence that a day 2 test has been booked in the UK. We had to challenge the staff here as they were stating that a day 8 was needed as well. Not if you are doubled jabbed. Covid test result in The Gambia Passenger locator form for the UK. PP 4) Luggage drop - the conveyor belt does not work. So you weigh your luggage and take them off to place them back onto the luggage trolley. Air Brussels are strict with weight and do not give you an inch. Your hand luggage is also weighed at this point. 5) Passengers proceed to bag security where the luggage is scanned, checked and can be opened (so have your keys ready) The bags are then weighed again. Once this is done the bags are taken by a man to be placed in holding. 6) Next stop - The passenger locator form for Brussels then needs to be shown at another desk. 7) Travellers then need to proceed to immigration, where eye scans, a further PP check is done and finger prints are taken 8) Another security check again for hand luggage which is scanned and your PP is checked again. 9) The final check is done before you board the plane and access the bus. Covid test result - despite being shown already Standard PP check boarding pass Hand luggage is weighed again Boarding pass for connecting flights need to be shown as well. I would suggest leaving early to get to the airport. I would also suggest that you eat inside the airport at the restaurant to the top right. The restaurant past the final check point is limited and more expensive too. You are also attacked by flies whilst eating. There is no duty free shopping either.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Patricia Merlo,1/2/2024,"It is astonishing that Barbados Grantley Airport is still as unfriendly and disorganised as other reviewers described it years ago. Although we were in transit, we had to have all our belongings scanned again by customs and this was done incredibly slowly and with unfriendly, harsh orders from the officials. The most amazing thing was that they shouted at us because some of us were carrying rum in sealed bags from Grenada Duty Free. They treated the people concerned as if they were serious criminals. The bags were confiscated. The people concerned asked what would happen to them now. We were told that we would get them back at the gate. At the gate, the staff knew nothing about it. They just shrugged their shoulders and kept the passengers waiting for about half an hour. Then an employee set off, slow as a snail, and finally came back with 3 bags. He crawled off again and brought a few more bags. Everyone got on the plane, even those who hadn't got their bags back. The crew finally took care of the matter and the rest were brought onto the plane. The passengers were accused by the airport staff of not having listened. However, we were still unable to take off as the airport's passenger system suddenly went on strike and several officials had to go through the aircraft to count us several times. After an hour's delay, we saw Barbados getting smaller under the aircraft. I will definitely not be returning to this inhospitable airport, no way!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Lesley Eames,1/4/2018,"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have had the misfortune to pass through. Both arrival and departure were very stressful. I travelled with two people who needed wheelchair assistance. On arrival we had to wait on the plane for about three quarters of an hour because there is only one ""cherry picker"" (the contraption that lifts the wheelchair folk from the plane to the ground) and this was in use elsewhere (there are no air bridges at this airport). We were lucky, with special assistance we jumped the queues, but it still took an hour. I felt sorry for those in the huge queue for immigration which seemed to move at a snail's pace. Our special assistance lady got us a redcap porter, I'm not sure I would have managed without her as they were thin on the ground. She also took us to the front of the queue for customs clearance, there was also a long queue for this. No walking through a door signed ""nothing to declare"". She then got us a taxi. Honestly without her I really don't know how we would have managed. The whole place is chaotic. Perhaps they have expanded faster than they can cope with. The return journey was slightly better as we were able to use the club lounge. This is shared between all airlines and is more like an upmarket cafe than a club lounge, but it's a haven from the scrum downstairs. I hope never to have to pass through this airport ever again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Barcelona,airport,Emily Curran,7/27/2024,"I took a flight on Air Senegal from Dakar to Barcelona and was meant to transit in Barcelona to Dublin. My bag did not arrive in Barcelona, and due to long immigration lines I missed my flight to Dublin. I rebooked a flight for that evening, and then spent the entire day tracking down each of the four luggage carriers in Barcelona airport; all of them claimed to not work with Air Senegal, and kept sending me back to each other. I went back and forth from Terminal 1 to 2 repeatedly, and when I asked for help at information kiosks the staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful, acting as if it was an inconvenience for them to provide information, which is their job. I was in tears after a few hours of this. Each luggage carrier claimed that they don’t work with Air Senegal so they would not allow me to fill in a declaration form, which is needed for the lost luggage to be entered in the system. I also was unable to claim the insurance on my lost bag that I had prepaid for because they would not allow me to fill the declaration form. The only luggage carrier that was helpful was Avia Partner; there were two staff there who were really lovely and the male staff member even helped me to fill a declaration form manually. Unfortunately a manual form does not enter the loss into any systems, it just documents that I was there. I called Barcelona Airport repeatedly after finally arriving in Dublin and the Barcelona Airport staff refused to help me once again. I still have no idea where my bag is one month later. While this is a shared problem between Air Senegal and Barcelona Airport, I felt that I was not treated respectfully by the majority of staff in the airport and overall it was an awful experience of which I hope does not happen to anyone again. If anyone finds a large red suitcase lying around Barcelona Airport, please let me know. I would seriously consider switching airports if you can on your trip and avoid Barcelona completely.

Your baggage handling system and technology is not fir for purpose, as demonstrated on a recent flight that was cancelled to Copenhagen where it took you 2 hours to get bags off an aircraft that hadn't even left! Your airport's treatment of passengers on a cancelled flight was shameful and a total abdication of passenger care responsibility.

Beijing Capital,airport,S Valderi,6/6/2024,"I can't help but being disappointed at my experience with Terminal 3 at Beijing Airport. I had two transits there, on the way to and back from Japan, once in the early morning (5am), and once in the evening (7pm). The terminal is large, pleasant to move around, and quite clean. Water is free, in paper cups, which isn't always the same. The negatives are many, so I'll start with a big one: the wifi is awful. An absurd number of websites are blocked, this being China, but even those feel random. Youtube is a no-go, but Whatsapp works fine. Instagram worked for my girlfriend, but not for me. Twitter worked on the first transit, but not the second. This might seem minor, but the anoyance accumulates when you're left with nothing at all to do in an empty terminal. Because it is empty: food and shops option are severely limited, with only one restaurant and one perfume shop being open when we were there, even though it wasn't too late or early. I was looking forward to buying a magazine in Chinese since I'm studying it, but those were nowhere to be found. Food itself is fine, but comes with a caveat, the severe lack of meat-free options. My girlfriend is piscitarian, but even so we found all noodle dishes and sandwiches had meat, you'll just have to make do. Going around the terminal you'll notice a severe lack of plugs, which are stingily doted out 2 at a time at specific spots. Inexplicably, at the end of the terminal a small decorated area has abundant plugs and armchairs to rest, at odds with the rest of the place, almost to reward those intrepid enough to drag their luggage so far away from everything else. The above had left a pretty mediocre impression on my first transit, but on our return it got worse, as we had to interact with staff and services. We had a 7 hour layover, so we were planning on using a lounge to rest. No such luck. We were not entitled to Air China's Business and First Class lounges, so we went to the Transit Lounge. There the staff spoke hardly any English, ""you had to book"", which was comical on several fronts. First of all, the whole airport was empty, secondly Air China's website did not say booking was mandatory. The website booking also didn't work. The (very expensive) hourly hotel? ""Full, full, all full"". It gave a strong impression that staff just couldn't be bothered to have English guests. Near the fountain a sign read ""paid lounge"", so we took an elevator down there. The stinky and mostly empty lounge sat brightly lit, but staff was seemingly unaware of the sign outside, and spoke even less English. We then decided to ask the information desk, which unhelpfully, and again with very limited English, sent us to the aforementioned lounges. ""No idea"" why they wouldn't offer paid services. A brief note on the use of English, as I don't want to sound entitled. I have studied Chinese, so I could have attempted a conversation, but after a long flight, and ahead of a transit I was quite tired. Plus, with the broken wifi, the dictionary was not available. I think it's quite normal in a space specifically designed to accomodate international travellers to account for English being spoken. Even ignoring that, and trying to use the giant tablet with map information, it's all in Chinese. It seems a sign of general disinterest that little to no effort is made to have English options, which surely is detrimental not just to travellers, but to staff.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Beijing Capital,airport,1 reviewsIvan Chumakov,4/22/2024,"I was transiting with Air China in Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3. Most international flights operate from Concourse T3E, but some use T3D. In my cause both arrival and departure were from T3E. On transit passengers need to go through document and security and customs check. The walking times are not really long and mostly travelators are available. There are 2 transfer service checkpoints, one from each side of the concourse. The crowd is not really well organized and staff is not really helpful. Not everyone speaks English, which is quite frustrating, when you actually need to communicate with airport or security staff. Arriving early in the morning, get ready to spend 1h queuing for transit. Other than that, I have to note that Terminal 3 is very modern by its looks and layout. The ceiling is high, which makes it seam like the airport is free and spacious. Walking distances are not too long. Most gates are accessible in less than 10 minutes of calm stroll. Between T3E, T3D and T3C there is an automated people mover (train), which is easily accessible after security. I didn't use it, but I located its station and observed it a little. There are few restaurants, which in my opinion are quite reasonable priced. Early in the morning only few Chinese restaurants and Western cafes were opened. The food is actually quite delicious. I would note good availability of seating spaces. Some are equipped with universal power outlets and USB chargers. If you want to use Wi-Fi, better use Wi-Fi kiosks as SMS sometimes doesn't go through. Be aware that you won't be able to use most messengers and social networks. Also it was nice to have drinking fountains within short reach from most seating areas. I would suggest considering Beijing Capital Airport as transit hub for Asia. Clean and modern airport with all the necessary facilities for longer transits.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Beijing Daxing,airport,Andy Wilson,6/9/2023,"Big, nice and clean airport. But that’s all. The airport (international departure) is way too big, the airport is very empty. Check-in is very frustrating. Travelled with Qatar Airways and always have had pleasant experiences with them. Not at Daxing airport. 2kg overweight for 2 person was an issue. Needed to re-arrange. After that the check-in lady wanted to weigh the cabin luggage. That was slightly overweight as well. But she wanted to charge 40USD/kg. Although it is the airlines right, never had this experience before with Qatar Airways. She didn’t want to issue the boarding pass until we cleared some stuff. After some negotiations we said we will clear at the gate. This frustrated the journey. At the end they did not check anything at the gate. The queue at the check-in counter was very long. After queuing for a while we realised a separate queue for online-check-in. Time wasted. The signs were not clear and the personnel was not pro-active to inform people. You also need to do a health declaration (arrival and departure). But the machine at the airport is a joke and doesn’t work most of the time. The security check checks every inch of your body, never had this experience as well. They have to take a photo of you prior you clear immigration, at the immigration and when going through security. Every baggage you have they need to take a photo of you and the baggage. For what?! Shops were closes in the evening (after 10pm) and hardly any food courts or restaurants. Disappointing. The connection to the airport is not so convenient: high speed trains every hour or so from Beijing West Railway Station, but the tickets need to be bought in advance. Or metro, but if you are coming from downtown, you need to change metro couple of times. Taxi would be an alternative. Overall, I would prefer Beijing Capital International Airport.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Belfast,airport,6 reviewsC Hill,11/21/2024,"The airport is undergoing more renovation as it seems to have been doing for the last 15 or so years, so much so I’d say that since around 2010 I’m really not sure Ive been through the airport twice and its been the same in terms of features, layout and processes due to continuous upgrades. And yet with this there seems to be very little change in the improvement to customer experience. The departure process is head and shoulders above arrivals, although is by no means in and of itself world beating. The food places are of low/average quality with generally lacklustre service and yet at very high end prices. While I’ve been lucky with queue times of late, Ive seen plenty of people complaining on social media about ridiculous wait times at departure security despite so much noise from the airport about the improvements. Seating and comfort is minimal unless you are spending £££ at one of the overpriced eateries and the general patina and cleanliness of the building interior in many places leaves a lot to be desired. On return the processing time at immigration wasn’t too bad and the wait at baggage was OK too, however the appearance of the arrivals area from departing the plane until exiting the terminal is very dated, grubby and lacklustre. It does seem like the management approach to patchwork upgrades over a very protracted period of time does not yield great results as there is never a moment where a clean start to finish customer experience is pulled off. Finally, and this was exacerbated by our early morning flight on a November morning… any airport that calls itself “International” should be offering skybridges as standard and not leaving passengers to walk the apron in the cold and rain.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

The staff are overly officious, the atmosphere is more reminiscent of a prison that an airport. Security staff were unnecessarily abrupt, imperatives were used with satisfaction, ‘move’ ‘get’ ‘take’ ‘put’. The business lounge was ‘The Worst’ I have ever visited. The carpet was filthy, the toilet unsanitary, the food selection basic. The lady at the reception desk must have been trained in customer care by North Korea.

Our flex-economy ticket gave us access to the Aspire lounge which was very quiet but well stocked with food and beverages.

Car parking was ok for a change, the anpr camera actually worked this time and issued me with a ticket then opened up. Check in was simple enough but as before there is a distinct lack of seating in departures. The vast bulk of seating is swallowed up by overpriced eateries. I didn't see any mobile charging ports etc although I believe there are some in the private lounge that will cost you around £30 to enter.

Transporting animals is stressful and hard, and waiting in the middle of a busy terminal was unacceptable. If the dog had been checked in on time, and normal procedures followed as advised by the airline (covering the cage, placing the cage in a quiet area) there would have been no concerns.

Belize,airport,Gerald Preis,7/27/2004,My trip to Belize took me through BZE 3 times. It is a classic sleepy 2-room airport: an updated arrivals hall with a mechanical carousel a communal departure area serving the 4 or 6 gates (glass doors really) that lead to the tarmac separated by the small warm somewhat chaotic check-in area. Some staff were friendly and enthusiastic security checks were minimal. Few large jets come to BZE but they do seem to be timed near each other. Most flights are prop planes to the interior and the offshore reefs. There is a pleasant open air deck that allows views of arriving and departing passengers walking to and from their planes. There is nothing else to do while waiting for your flight. Bring a book. Amenities are few: tiny gifts shops snack bars and a cafeteria. A good place to people watch. Very stress-free and it serves its purpose. Ambergris Cay was our real destination. Well worth the trip!,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Joaquim Coelho,12/18/2014,"I flew a couple of times this year into Belo Horizonte's Confins International airport and I must say that this airport lacks the basics. It was supposed to be renovated for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a few weeks before the tournament the airport was in utter chaos. It seemed as if I was in a construction sight. I came back during the World Cup and things improved a little giving it a more pleasant atmosphere. I am Brazilian so the language is not a problem but I spoke with some people that passed through the airport and they complained how few people spoke English. The airport does not receive many international flights. Only flights are to Buenos Aires-Argentina Miami-USA Lisboa-Portugal and Panama City-Panama and only a few of those are daily. Most of the times I arrived to this airport were on domestic flights but in July I came from the USA using a Copa Airlines flight from Panama City. I was puzzled as to why the plane did not parked directly at the gate since it arrived early in the morning and there were many finger gates with no planes parked whatsoever. Immigration officials were not friendly and showed little professionalism the lady that checked my passport had one earphone on and was chewing gum with her mouth open. The luggage carrousel is a complete mess as the area is very cramped and small. Customs was the only positive as once I had my luggage I went through it quickly. This airport has very bad air conditioning and in the summer it can be horribly hot inside and having to wait to board with very little seating can be a hassle. It is really far from downtown Belo Horizonte but the roads are good and I recommend taking the ""Conexão Aeroporto"" buses that take you straight to the center of the city for a rate of R$ 21 (around 10 dollars). This option is very advantageous because taking a cab directly from the airport is ridiculously expensive. Have seen worse airports but this one is one that I am certainly not very fond of. Does it's job but could be far off better and I hope it does get better once the renovations are finished.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

In terms of services it has banks restaurants newsagents cash machines and a post office. There is no internet access for passengers which is ridiculous for the third biggest airport in Brazil. I had to send an urgent business email and had to beg the local administration office (on the top floor of the terminal) to use one of their computers for 5 minutes. Thanks to the good nature of most of the Brazilian people this was allowed (saving me from a lot of problems) but if the management is willing to put mobile phones rechargers in the terminal (I could see they were available for everyone for free) they could also make the effort to put a couple of internet access points.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bengkulu,airport,3 reviewsRafael Suarez,6/27/2018,"I traveled to Bengkulu, Indonesia to visit friends for the first time in November 2017. Flew on Lion Air.

Nice outdoor gardens greet you and on the day I arrived a nice afternoon breeze. Slowly make the way to the inside of the terminal where one luggage belt, half inside the terminal and a portion outside the terminal awaits. The luggage eventually arrives and it gives you time to see the pictures of some of the sights to see in Bengkulu. Once luggage in hand you go outside where there are various options for transport to where ever you are going. I was met by friends that took me to the hotel. Two weeks later, I left Bengkulu and experienced the departure area. You go through the usual security immediately upon entering the terminal, (say your good byes outside the door,) then walk to the check in desk where you obtain your boarding pass and check your luggage. English is not widely spoken at the airport if at all, but I had no issues whatsoever. You then go to the gate area, nice seats, air conditioned, tv's, bathrooms, and probably restaurants though I left on the first flight out and I not see anything to buy food or drinks.

I waited 90 minutes from the time my boys flight landed to the time they got through passport control. Absolutely ridiculous. They stood in the pouring rain because there was no room under the 'hangar' of an arrivals hall. My sons could have flown to Bordeaux which is 70 minutes from our home and we would have been home quicker travelling 70 mins, than me sitting in the carport for 90 minutes waiting for them to come through. Bergerac airport had better wake up and smell the coffee and realise you can not treat passengers like this. They are not cattle and security checks are carried out heavily in the UK so why on earth they have to interrogate every passenger that arrives? One family of four took ten minutes to answer questions. Bergerac can not possibly compete with the other international airports in France unless it changes its attitude and builds a better hall for arriving passengers. Their car park is being heavily invested in only to make money from people needing to park their cars there.

I went to T2 and cut various corners, otherwise it would not have been possible to reach my flight in time. The only good thing about T2 is that you do not have to take everything out because at T1, I have experienced several times over the last weeks that they check everything in your carry-on luggage. They take Christmas cookies away, they take presents away, they are slow, unfriendly, and it makes me feel so ashamed to be a German because of this. It's a disgrace for the German capitol.

Our luggage took two hours to appear with no reasons given for the delay other than a repeating message that due to operational issues it was delayed (no sh*t sherlock). Departing from that airport was even worse. After fighting Berlin traffic to get out of the city check in, passport and X-Ray officials were particularly unhelpful. Access to the gates was super confusing with one area closed off with no clear signage where to go. The layout on airside is a debacle. Restaurants and shops are miles to walk to with no conveyor belts. The ceiling is so low and dark it feels really oppressive. Terrible airport.

Security staff on all three occasions have been rude despite us speaking German, making sure to lecture us in one way or another. It took an hour and a half to go through it and if our flight hadn't been delayed, we would certainly have missed it. We travel a lot on business and Berlin must be the worst airport we have ever experienced.

Berlin Schonefeld,airport,G Garbutt,4/6/2020,"Was disappointed by the lack of space and the blandness of the terminal arriving and departing from this airport located in a capital city. I've been in and out of non-primary regional domestic airports which are far more impressive. I would've opted for Berlin Tegel if available. This airport is not as convenient as it is further away from the city centre. No seating in the pre-check-in greeting area. No shelter going to and coming from the car park. Very noticeable when the weather is bad as it was when I was there. There was a convenience style shop which was quite well stocked but nothing exceptional by way of gifts. In the post-check-in area, the hallways are very narrow and tiny and hard seats are either to be found in a long row along the corridor or in tiny boxes around the departure gate. Airport lounge was not worth the bother. Shopkeepers only spoke German even after speaking English to them first. Passport clearance consisted of only one booth for the 100 or so passengers boarding and again a very narrow passage. Baggage collection was quite quick but this is probably because of how tiny the terminal was. The distance from the plane to passport control then baggage collection is so short and badly signposted that you could easily overlook that you are actually in the correct baggage claim area. The airport app was not very appealing and the wifi signal weak.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Berlin Tegel,airport,Tim Leborgne,2/24/2020,I believe Tegel is one of the worst airports I have visited in Europe. Its organisation is uselessly complicated (how many security check areas do they have - one for each 2 to 5 gates? How can that be financially viable? The wait times and queuing are ridiculous. The staff are unfriendly and unhelpful. The amenities outside and inside the airport are truly lacking (No smoking areas inside! Smokers with a long wait need to exit the airport).,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Berlin Tegel,airport,M. Braun,12/21/2019,"The airport is in no way adequate to that of a capital city airport, it is incredibly dirty, the organization is an absolute disaster (after the landing, the transport buses are ready on the plane, but it took 30 minutes to get at least 1 escalator to the plane ). The toilets are partly out of order and extremely dirty, you can see at every corner that the cleaning costs are extremely saved. All in all, it is infinitely embarrassing to present a “cosmopolitan city” like Berlin, those responsible should be ashamed! | Der Flughafen ist dem eines Hauptstadtflughafens in keiner Weise angemessen, es unfassbar dreckig, die Organisation ist eine absolute Katastrophe (nach der Landung stehen die Transportbusse zwar am Flugzeug bereit aber es dauerte geschlagene 30 Minuten bis man es geschafft hat wenigstens 1 Rolltreppe zum Flugzeug zu bringen). Die Toiletten sind zum Teil ausser Betrieb und extrem verschmutzt, man merkt an jeder Ecke das extrem bei den Reinigungskosten gespart wird.

Berlin Tegel,airport,K Pearce,12/11/2019,"Awful experience! I am a very frequent (business) traveller and have seen a lot of airports in the world. But this one exceeded my worst nightmares. We were in the line for the security check to Amsterdam, combined with Paris. We had over 1 hour to go through security for Amsterdam (Paris flight had 30 min), but it took ages! Only one gate was open (another one was idle, no personnel). The guy performing the screening was taking all the time in the world as if we were not in a hurry. Personnel were very unfriendly, yelling at us. Paris passengers were really getting worried they could not make their flight. The screening guy did not notice this. In the end, someone called all the Paris passengers to the front, which upset the screening guy very much. He really flipped and sent back the passengers to the end of the line. When we started complaining about this ridiculous situation, the guy even stopped the scanner and called the airport police! He deliberately stopped the process to make us miss the flight. After 10 minutes the police came and we could explain the situation. They checked our passports and convinced the screening guy to start checking again. We barely made our flight. It was the worst airport nightmare of my life! Never again Berlin Tegel. It is a disgrace for the Germany capital, a country that has the name of being well organised and 'pünktlich'. I advise them to check out Schiphol Amsterdam for a much better experience!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Peter Cullen,9/24/2008,I used Tempelhof for the first (and I guess last) time last week. It is wonderful - why are modern airports not like this? The history and architecture are fabulous of course but it also works incredibly well - admittedly having so few flights means nothing is really under pressure. As noted elsewhere public transport links are excellent one can be in the city centre within 15 minutes of walking off the plane. From the departure lounge to seat on the aircraft takes less than a minute. I guess it is an anachronism in the 21st century but it is sad to say goodbye to an airport with real character.,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,W Wynants,12/16/2007,This post World War II airbridge landmark is probably the best airport location worldwide. Nowadays it is called Zentral Flughafen and that is because the U-bahn is only a 3-minute walk . From here it only takes minutes to get anywhere in the city. The terminal is completely outdated but very charming: Planes park literally in the terminal and boarding and deboarding happen always dry thanks to the roof of the hangar. The toilets are clean there is a delishop/bar and all major car rental companies have a desk. Unfortunately THF is not smoke free passengers still smoke in the smoking area of the already small waiting areas at the gates.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Bermuda,airport,T Shuler,7/2/2021,"International Airport? What a joke. Although new, this airport is lacking in accommodations and facilities for travelers. For example, there's only 1 place to get anything to eat or drink in the entire airport. Stand in a Long line to order 2 burgers n fries, chips, and two drinks for $125.00! For that you can enjoy a 3 course meal at 5 star Ascots for two. Or, you can feast on a huge Sunday Brunch at Fourways for $120 for two. I've included photos of the restaurant poster, and then of the Real restaurant. Only 4 items actually offered- none from their poster. There is one shop, which closes at 4pm. There are very few travel supplies typical of any other airport. They claim that the shop is duty free, but liquor prices are higher than in town. Do not expect any common airport facilities other than this. If more than 1 plane arrives or departs at the same time, expect a backup at every stage of your experience. Honestly, I've had better accommodation and service at regional airports handling local traffic and single engine planes. Bermuda is an extremely friendly, welcoming, and inviting country with Much to offer any traveler. What a shame that the Airport authority leaves a holiday traveler with such a ugly parting view. Clean up your act, folks. It's embarrassing.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bermuda,airport,E Williams,7/3/2014,"This airport is horrible on the arrival side and barely passable on the departure side. On both the airport management should look into ""jetways."" Problems arriving: No jetway too few passport control personnel arrival hall to passport control inadequately air-conditioned going to the bathroom immediately on arriving puts you farther back in the passport line (I was near the front and waited just under an hour to reach the passport counter within 10 minutes the line had tripled in length so those people likely had to wait nearly 3 hours). Rude passport control officer. Extremely rude customs officer - she pawed through all my belongings being careful to disarrange them untidily. Then to the greeting area - no chairs to sit in while awaiting my pickup. Entire area filthy. By now I needed a bathroom a janitor directed me to one ""around the corner"" near a loading dock. It smelt of urine and was crawling with ants. Departure: confusing signage shops too few and overpriced at gate (upper level) one goes down a flight of stairs in order to go up a flight of stairs into the airplane. (At the bottom of the flight of stairs some sort of janitor screamed at me to show my passport. Oh well I suppose the boarding process needs more inefficiency. All flights in-&-out were delayed 90 minutes because that morning the radar was ""inoperative.""

Bermuda,airport,Edward Impey,6/28/2009,The airport itself is fine. easy to get to easy to navigate. Your problems could begin with the surly and aggressive border control staff.

Bermuda,airport,Bertram Forbes,1/29/2007,Bermuda's airport and Bermuda generally could be much more a pleasurable experience if it's government got rid of some nasty aspects of Bermuda for American British Canadian and European tourists. I refer to the mere $100 in duty-free allowances it offers its own residents compared to $800 allowed in the USA - and only $35 allowed by Bermuda in duty- free allowances to tourists.

Berne,airport,Paul Van Alsten,6/26/2010,ORY-BRN with Air France and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus connection with Berne central station upon each regular incoming and departing flight - one-way costs 5.20CHF. Check-in efficient and hassle-free - online check-in has now been introduced. Status travellers have access to the airport lounge above the departure gate. The only downside is the airport website - it is rather difficult to navigate within it as there are lots of advertisement.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Bhubaneswar,airport,Prasad Vinnakota,9/27/2010,We were travelling from Bhubaneshwar to Hyderabad recently. The airport was clean and nice but was shocked a little later at the security at this airport. While we were flying a person behind my row was complained about dripping water. The stewardess was puzzled and checked the luggage rack. There was this bag belonging to a passenger that contained a bottle of water that leaked drenching all the bags in that part before trickling down on the heads of people below. Note that this is a colored rectangular serrated bottle and not one of those branded mineral water bottles sold inside the secure zone. Also note that the passenger was able-bodied. It is clear that the security checks simply waved the bottle past. Having travelled from Newark to Hyderabad via Mumbai and suffering innumerable checks and having spent a small fortune on buying water inside the secure zone I was shocked at this incident. I suggest that the rules be strictly implemented and a refresher course be held for the personnel.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Biarritz,airport,Brian Murphy,8/27/2006,Recently flew to and from Roissy CDG to Biarritz International in the Basque country in south west France for the first time. The airport itself is small but there is a good bus service which will take you into the city centre pretty quickly. On arrival on the 13.00 HRS AF 7638 flight from CDG this flight seemed to coincide with a number of other flights from the UK which made the baggage arrivals area chaotic. In addition the toilet facilities landside need some upgrading and definitely could do with the cleaners visiting there on a more frequent basis especially mid-afternoon which seems to be the peak time for the airport. The rubbish bin in the gents toilet was overflowing when I was there which left a poor initial impression! The airport does have an excellent tourism booth with very helpful staff however. In addition from the airport one can get onto the nearby motorway very quickly and the care hire agencies also had very helpful staff at the airport (especially Europcar). On departing Biarritz back to Paris however I discovered that the departures area has only one very small cafe so passengers may not want to enter this area too quickly as the wait could be long and somewhat boring. In summary the airport is convenient but it falls well short of the new fresher and modern design of nearby Pau airport which is excellent.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

On top of that nobody knew what they were doing - how to check in the luggage (took 45 minutes to start the process with no information what is happening!) or how to board us (again long wait and no information!).

Billund,airport,G Fagirdóttir,9/13/2022,"Firstly there were no family queues, so I had to wait in line for 20 min with two crying 18 month old toddlers. We were not allowed to take the twin stroller upstairs, they said it was to big for the security check, which was wrong, would have gone through easily. Most twin strollers are designed to fit standard doors and a wheelchair bigger then our stroller rolled through easily. But the danish computer says no mentality was not budged. Anyway, we had to hold crying twins and the hand luggage (a lot of luggage comes with two toddlers), while the stroller was folded and marked. After that the guy said “then you take it to the odd size luggage desk”. Yup holding a folded twin stroller while holding a crying toddler is super easy. Going through security (no priority for baby families), we had no place to put the toddlers while taking out electronics, liquid baby food etc. out of the bags so they were running around crying. Finally after coming through security there were some strollers available at the airport (“very nice strollers” as put by the guy that checked us in). There were 6 strollers there, 4 were broken, so we took the two dirty ones that were left. Never ever flying through there with toddlers again!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

I had to wait for a staff, unfortunately, but she was incredibly helpful, calm and smiling. Their security staff may seem a little stiff, this day was not busy, but they still did not have the profits for a smile. However, they must be praised for being very quick to get guests through. This airport had a passenger record a few years ago, with 3 million passengers annually, therefore, they chose to expand the airport. But instead of giving passengers the more space they deserve, they chose instead to expand their very fine lounge, which is never filled, as well as the office for the staff - a disgrace to people who travel a lot. The design of the airport is great even though it is old. as mentioned, the staff are some of the friendliest staff and they are the reason why I love coming here.

Billund,airport,M Cooper,2/19/2020,"Kind, friendly staff! I was due to travel back to Frankfurt on 9th February when Storm Ciara/Sabine hit Northern and Central Europe. My Lufthansa flight was cancelled before I left for the airport and I was rebooked via text message onto two SAS flights - Billund-Oslo then Oslo-Frankfurt the next day. Unfortunately, after 3/4 hour at the gate on the Monday, my SAS flight was cancelled for technical reasons. There was no SAS rep at the airport so we all had to call their call centre to rebook our flights. I was pretty frustrated but an SAS employee at the call centre was friendly enough when I got through and told me my flight had already been rebooked, though I hadn't had a text message or mail at that time. The Billund airport staff I spoke to couldn't have been friendlier and more helpful. Their hands were tied as they weren't responsible for rebooking our flights but they went out of their way to guide me and fellow passengers. I had had no info from the airline about the chance of booking a hotel/meal vouchers etc. but one kind airport employee took it into his own hands and sorted it all out for me, booking a room and printing a voucher (which they could clearly then redeem from SAS). In short, not much more than an hour after the flight cancellation announcement, I was in an airport hotel room and had time to have dinner and relax before flying the next morning (which all happily worked out). I often fly to and from Billund airport and it's one of my favourites - comfortable, good design, good shops, cafes and restaurants, plenty of seating, perfect view of the runway, etc. Since that day, I've added friendly staff to my list of positives.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Billund,airport,Christian Britten,9/17/2009,Billund is an excellent airport with good facilities practical layout and friendly and efficient staff. My only gripe is the airport bus which is extortionate (DKK180 to Aarhus) and runs at often perplexing times that seem to have no correlation to when major flights are landing. I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away. As the airport is far from where most foreign travellers want to be (unless they really like Lego) you often have little option but to wait for the bus or pay even more for a taxi.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Billund,airport,Claus Nielsen,2/19/2009,My favourite airport. Fast efficient and very pleasant. Easy to get to easy to navigate check-in and security is always fast and friendly and the lounge above Security is great. Extremely roomy and classy great for work or relaxation even offers open smoker's cabins that don't feel like a cage - and a chess game for those with plenty of time. Almost everywhere in the airport can you overlook the runway and the whole place is just modern roomy and open. The airport size is an advantage without doubt - the distances between parking check-in security lounge gate and flight are minimal so getting in and out is always a pleasure. Much better than Copenhagen in almost all aspects.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Several breakfast options in the check-in hall. Easy and friendly check-in. So is security check.

The 20 min free car park is just far enough away to mean you cannot get to the terminal and back before having to pay. The check in queues seem to be everywhere. The escalators are intermittently out of service. The signage is poor or non existent in places. One of the few airports I have been through recently where you still have to pay for a trolley not that you would be able to push one through the crowds. There is not enough seating in the duty free area. It is hardly every possible to get on a plane without going through a basement holding are to get on an overcrowded bus to be taken practically to the other side of the airport.

Birmingham,airport,Jay Nagley,10/1/2024,"It took 1 hour and 25 minutes from joining the pre-queue for bag drop to getting through security - on a Monday afternoon at the end of September.

They took out the staircase last year and made everyone use overloaded lifts. Our lift said Out of Service before it wheezed up to Departures - three minutes to climb one floor. When a Ryanair plane is a haven of peace and civility, you know you have just emerged from a circle of hell. Is Michael O'Leary paying them to ruin the airport, so that his planes seem better? The airport works so hard to ensure it is the worst airport in the UK. Couldn't they spend 10% of the effort on making something (anything) at the airport actually work?

I wonder how those taxfree shops make any money, because you sure have no time or energy left to shop (or get a bite to eat). And when you finally arrive at the gate and actually glad that the plane was delayed (otherwise it would have been a close call), you have to sit on the floor to rest your feet from being on your feet for hours on end.

On our return again swift baggage claim and on the road home within half an hour. The only downside we arrived well before we were meant to and check in wasn't even open however the parking was a nightmare. We went right round the back to the overflow car park and only at the very last minute managed to squeeze on the end of someone else. I cant imagine what would have happened if wed left it later we would have missed our flight. Also it was a long walk to the terminal building and it was pouring with rain we were amazed their wasn't and easier way in to the building also our car on return was covered in dust from all the passing vehicles.

The tax was allegedly to develop the airport (hence the name) but every cent of it goes into the pockets of the Directors. Not a single penny has been spent on improvements. The owners will argue that the place has been improved .... and it has. However the franchises that use the place (duty free cafe newsagents etc) all paid for the improvements so don't believe the owners. The place is also filthy and cold and when it rains they have to use buckets to collect rainwater.

I was expecting a small airport with limited facilities but nothing prepared me for the facilities here. Parking is free which was a bonus for me when booking on arrival however both car parks P1 and P2 were full and ended up abandoning my car on a grass area known as an overfill car park. This was a 10 minute walk to the airport. On arrival there was nothing before the departure lounge. The cash machine was out of service and WHSmiths closed. Paying the £10 airport charge was no problem and I was assisted with my baggage tag by a very helpful Jet2 worker. The worst experience was going through security where the staff were extremely rude not just with me but with an elderly couple in front of me. I agree that security needs to be strict but not intrusive and this was made a much more uncomfortable experience by the rudeness and lack of customer service with the staff. I will never be using this airport again and even after a drink from the limited choice in the cafe/bar I was still reeling. I can safely say this is the 1st and last time I will use this airport.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Blackpool,airport,Paul Wharmby,9/8/2013,We travelled to Turkey on Jet2 mid-August returning early-September. We travelled from Blackpool as the holiday was some £250 cheaper than using Manchester. The car park ticket machine had run out of tickets but that didn't matter as the barriers to P2 had been broken off. We parked a good 5 minutes' walk from the terminal but it's free so I don't really see that being a problem. The terminal building is very basic and is more reminiscent of a coach station but check-in and security were both quick and easy (as was paying the ADF) and we were sitting in the bar area enjoying our first drink of the holiday while we'd still have been in the security queue at Manchester. An important point was that because we were going on a small plane to a small airport check-in at Dalaman on our return was incredibly easy drawing jealous stares from fellow travellers who were in 200-long queues. On our return to Blackpool from wheels stop through security and baggage reclaim to leaving the airport took less than 30 minutes. You absolutely cannot get better. The airport has a runway planes somewhere to sit and somewhere to get a drink. What else do you need?,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Blackpool,airport,Peter Walker,7/3/2013,The poor lighting inside makes it look as if you have just walked into a fairground dark ride. The gents toilet (singular you'll notice) always smells of something unpleasant. The advertising blurb tells of facilities that are never open and it has a help desk that is manned only when the staff feel like it which is as good as never. It looks like an uncompleted job on which the builders have walked off because the service pipes are all exposed and there is not so much as a false ceiling to hide it all. It has been like this for decades. To then ask the public to pay £10 each to refurbish something that should be done out of the operating profits over many years is a disgrace. Forget expecting to see a terminal akin to those airy ones with glass and steel as at `proper` airports this is a chicken-shed inspired windowless dark oblong box. You are unable to see any aircraft from inside or outside so plane spotters stay away.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Blantyre,airport,Duncan Lee,7/14/2004,I flew from Blantyre airport a number of years ago and was struck by just how quaint the whole set up was. It is a very basic airport not far off the common 'tin shack' analogy that comes with most African airports. There is very little to do and there is just a bar to distract you. The best thing about Blantyre airport is the Duty Free shop. A selection so limited it is almost refreshing: Malawi Gin Whisky (JW) Cane spirit macadamia nuts coffee and nick nacks. I bought to 60W light bulbs that had been turned into paraffin lamps. Wonderful.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE
Boa Vista,airport,1 reviewsDaryn Johnson,6/18/2015,"I personally really like this airport. It's small but does everything it needs to. It looks more like a sand castle than an airport but every time I've used it it's been easy to check in. Unfortunately there is no smoking area anywhere in the airport and considering a fair portion is non smoking I find that a bit strange. Also, once I was delayed and as there are no tannoy announcements you are left wondering about that status of your flight which if you've travelled TACV can be understood. However, if you're a resident of Cape Verde you do get used to the ""no stress"" mentality even if it can be frustrating sometimes. There's a bar either side of check in/customs and they serve snacks. There's also a small duty free shop but most airline's stock would be more comprehensive.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL

Bodrum,airport,Clive Heys,7/27/2019,"Problems with arrival and departure. Arrival: Arrived an hour late at 23.00. Three flights worth of passengers, about 500 people, arrived in passport control together. Six passport gates. All staffed but none working. Lights above each gate indicating which type of arrivals for which gate. Lights kept changing. Staff kept arriving and leaving each gate. No info displayed or given. After around 60 minutes, they started processing us. Total time from arrival to transfer coach, around 2 hours. Pretty inexcusable I’m afraid, given that they knew the flights were arriving, and when. Departure: no signage as to which queue to join, reliant on wandering Jet2 staff for info. Airport staff at initial security check very surly. Food and duty free area too busy, food and drinks expensive, duty free prices a lot higher than UK high street on average. Woefully inadequate seating. No helpful info. A further security check was suddenly invoked but only for gates 201 and 202. This was so slow that it would have jeopardised our departure, had we not already been delayed. No info at all about delay. Around 90 mins at gate with 8 staff and no info. No toilets for this time without going beck through security checkpoint. The security check at the departure gate was the FIFTH and last. Question, if you need to do a fifth security check, are you not admitting that at least one (I’m being polite here) of your previous checks was a little bit of a waste of time? Only actually arrived at Manchester about 40 mins late, but that’s not an achievement, it’s an indication of the fraudulent amount of slack built into the flight times, a practice which is only “bettered” by the UK rail industry.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

I just needed to get out of there.  My friend had to push me around even though we had handicap service, and she had to follow behind a worker who disappeared eventually. Like I said before, very unprofessional. Another experience we had was at the ice cream shop. The lady was refusing to serve my friend another flavor because we “couldn’t do that” we need to pay more, granted money is not an issue but she refused to serve her even after my friend told her to charge her.

Bogota,airport,Harold Bush,1/31/2024,"A very modern, elegant and efficient airport. From taxi to lounge it took us less than 15 minutes. But beware of extreme and violent security just before boarding. We were forced to leave our bags in the middle of the passage way leading to the airbridge and moved against the wall, while a sniffer dog went over them. No one told us what to do or what to expect. Then we were forded to face the wall while a police office hand searched us. No instructions was given, not even in Spanish; we just follow what others did. Very scary. I have never seen anything like this before. My hand was violent moved upwards by the police officers during the search. Iberia should have informed us this was going to happen, and what to do. A lot of passengers complained and the pilot called the dispatcher on board (the purser told us). Not a nice experience being treated like criminals as though one was in a prison and they were carrying out security checks.

Security took away my beard scissors (3cm), that have been OK around the world (only Dubai has done the same once from 3 times). All cool. Did not even try the airport WIFI - found that this sucks everywhere. Enough shopping after security. I did get my souvenir coffee and other stuff. Eating after getting in to airport security area is an only real problem ... there is a food court where everyone queues for Burger King and next to that there are some .. not-so-pizza-pizza place and some other strange places where no one buys anything.

Boise,airport,K Miller,8/13/2020,"A young woman was ahead of me at the TSA line and an older grumpy TSA agent told her to put a jacket on because her tank top was ""pretty revealing."" There was nothing special or revealing about this tank top, just your normal tank top that shows your shoulders as a tank top does. The airport is not a private school or a church. This man had no right to tell this poor girl to put a jacket on. Who does he think he is? The pastor of a church? She probably felt so embarrassed and ashamed and had absolutely nothing to feel that way about. He said it loudly enough that all of the people visibly turned around in line to look at her. The TSA in this airport need sensitivity training. This agent should be reprimanded. He is not this woman's father or authority figure in any way besides to check that she and everyone around her is making safe decisions to fly, he is not the dress code police. Despicable. It's 2020, women can wear a tank top if they choose to and absolutely nobody at the airport should feel that they have the authority to tell someone to cover up.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Boise,airport,Diana Neill,1/4/2020,"Upon arrival at the airport, there was a huge line but only a few staff. I went through Alaska Airlines. It was very confusing where I was supposed to go because there were so many people and so many different lines. The lines didn't look like lines at all. I checked in at the kiosk, got my boarding pass, then a lady who was walking around helping people said I needed to get a bag tag printed. So I had to go back in line and wait to get the tag printed. I had to pay a $30 fee, even though I have elite status and have never had to pay a bag fee before. I had never gone through the kiosk before. Then when I got to the front, she said I needed to wait to answer some questions. After standing there several minutes and seeing many people get helped who were there after me, I was finally helped. They just needed emergency contact name and number. Then going to the line for the security check, there were about 300 people there. I got to the airport an hour before my flight and when I got to the gate, they were already boarding. Seriously, they need more organization and more staff to help customers.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Boise,airport,1 reviewsKyle Kaupins,8/1/2016,"Boise is a smaller sized airport which takes in most if the state's airline traffic. Walking into the airport from the parking garage in the winter time can be quite grueling and in summer afternoons the outside can be very hot. Check in lines are never too long and the check in area is large with very pretty murals on the walls to look at. Lighting in any part of the terminal is not a problem with great natural light. Pre TSA there is only one eating area that is nothing special and the baggage claim is older giving you a 90's esque feel. For the size if the airport, the baggage handlers do take their sweet time getting the bags to their destination. I have waited over half an hour for bags before. Moving on to TSA, the lines are usually quick and screening does not take long. There is only one full body detector but traffic still flows freely. Due to the recent TSA problems though, the lines have reached back towards check in, but lines are never hectic in the morning. Post TSA is a set of large windows and an eating area. The windows give a great view across the airport. Food in the airport is classy, but a little sub par. The McDonalds that used to be the main attraction is now replaced with more Boise-like restaurants. Five guys and Einsteins bagels take up most of the hunger goers. On the other side of the eating are is a local brewing company. Shopping in the upper terminal is nothing to write home about - there is an MSNBC and cute convenience stores. The airport has no specialty shops and the stores all sell the exact same things, like candy, magazines, and little Idaho potato dolls. The C terminal below is dark, and again, very 90s esque. Birds have been seen inside the upper terminal before, they are adorable and not a nuisance to passengers. They give a somewhat natural ambiance. One of the biggest problems with the airport is their horrendous seats and very few charging ports. Most of the ports are up against walls or beams. Restrooms are located in one spot in the B terminal, and one location, just past TSA. Overall, the airport seems very clean friendly, like most of Idaho. A pretty good airport. Not great, but pretty good.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Boise,airport,M McManus,10/10/2012,The airport is a small regional airport. However there is a nice souvenir shop and a decent number of places to eat given its modest size.

Bologna Marconi,airport,Begum Yakut,2/17/2025,"In a comment, it was said that the airport is great for arrivals but terrible for departures. This is absolutely true! It was the worst service I’ve had and the worst airport I’ve ever used for a return flight from abroad! On February 15, 2025, we were passengers with my husband on flight PGT49BB from Bologna to Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen Airport. It took so long for us to check-in our baggage. When we saw the queue to pass through to the airside before passport control, we couldn’t even do a tax refund. As we were hoping for this disgrace to end so we could return to our country, boarding started from gate 19, and we were lucky enough to sit and wait until the line thinned out. When the queue decreased, we joined it. Two female ticket agents were handling the boarding. Despite having no cabin baggage with us (we had checked it in), the ticket agent told me that my two pockets, one about 30x40 cm and the other about 16x18 cm, contained too many items and that I wouldn’t be allowed on the plane with them. At that moment, my husband was also waiting for the other ticket agent to do the boarding. Since I had never heard such nonsense before, I told her that if I had too many pockets, I could transfer some items from one to the other and discard one pocket. Clearly, this didn’t sit well with her, as she was going to ask for money. Suddenly, she told me she wouldn’t let me on the plane and instructed me to go to the back of the line. I raised my voice and warned her that she had no right or authority to do that, and that she was obligated to let me on the plane. In response, the other female ticket agent rudely turned her back and made threats like, “We’ll call the police, and we won’t let you on the plane.” An airport that shows such disrespect to tourists should be ashamed. In the end, they should be thankful that I didn’t call the police because I didn’t want to take the passengers’ time. They ruined the end of our wonderful vacation because of their attitude, which we had never encountered in any airport before.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bologna Marconi,airport,N Campbell,3/18/2024,"We flew British Airways from LHR to Bologna on 20th February 2024. Despite a half-full plane, BA failed to load my suitcase. We reported this to the Lost Luggage office. The young lady who assisted us was rather casual about the matter, even though we told her I had no clothes but what I was wearing and we were only in Italy for 5 days, and we had a 2.5 hour drive to Jesi. She told us that we could wait to have it delivered to us but it wouldn't arrive until the day we left, or if we guaranteed we would come and pick it up today we could collect it at 18.30 hrs (6.30 pm). We said we would definitely come back at 6.30pm to collect the bag, even though it meant wasting a day waiting around. We confirmed that time three times with her. We duly showed back up at the Airport at 1830 and rang the bell to the Lost Luggage Office. No-one answered. We then noted the sign on the door that said opening hours 20.30-22.00. Another set of people who'd also lost luggage were also trying to make contact with the office. After trying the phone number provided to us by the girl in the morning, and ringing the bell repeatedly, we found an information counter and explained our problem to the woman there. She rang and spoke to someone INSIDE THE LOST LUGGAGE OFFICE, but they refused to speak to us or answer the phone or door. Finally at 20.32pm they answered the bell and let the now THREE groups of people trying to get their luggage in. By then we had accrued a 30 Euro parking fee, and then had to drive to a rural area near Jesi and get into a farmhouse in the dark. Bologna Airport has flights coming in pretty much 24/7 but a lost luggage office that is only open 3.5 hours a day, and refuses to help people outside that time, even if people are present in the office.

Bologna Marconi,airport,Geraldine Farrell,8/17/2023,"Marconi Express monorail service: Surprisingly poor service upon arrival at Bologna Airport from Bologna Centrale.

My ticket failed to work. There was no visible way to call for help or assistance. We were there and prisoners to the closed gate. The trapped father with pram sent his wife for help; from trying to get out first to help arriving took over 14 minutes. The staff member, when she arrived, was rude and brusque telling that we must have done it wrong. I am not aware of having done anything incorrect but, if I had, there had been no avenue for assistance. Having travelled the world, I can normally cope with a automated ticket! The Marconi Express Experience was very disappointing and actually quite anxiety inducing. At the point that I got through, the poor man with pram was still blocked and it took another 5 minutes for him to get through. I waited with him as he did not speak Italian. The assistant was rude and unpleasant in her responses offering no support or apology. As I waited, I watched another family trying to get through from the other side to go towards Bologna and also struggling. When they eventually got through, they also needed immediate assistance as their child got on the train they, with their luggage, struggled to get on. The doors closed and neither parent was on board. All anxiety inducing stuff! I'll look to get a taxi next time unless the service improves.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

I was waiting in the line for 20min. And than the security guy who was checking my passport and who barely spoke English told me to move in the side of the line to serve others. He had issue with my passport I have for almost a year and passport I used to arrive in the country. I gave my id to confirm my identity. But instead of letting me through he started to scan each page with UV light and checking each page in the scanning system. He started to scratch my passport with a nail and drop my id to see how its lands. My mother come back checking what take me so long because the airplane company already announced the last call. When like 5min left the manager come, check my passport for 1min and let me pass. I was the last one boarding. I wonder what would happen if they would keep me longer without explanation.

Despite its relatively decent size, there are no adequate business lounges, and the ""zone Affaire"" is frequently closed.  There are two internet options available, but neither seems to work reliably. Once you've cleared security, good luck finding amenities; there’s virtually nothing beyond the small boarding gates.

Both times going there ranged from fair to poor; bathrooms need serious cleaning and the interior needs an update & it looks like some areas haven't been swept or vacuumed in ages. The gap between great experiences and worst experiences at Logan Airport is one of the worst I've ever dealt with in my life. I feel like I have been going to Logan at the best times and the worst times and it is the sharpest gap between good and bad that I've ever witnessed. The airport in Indianapolis on the other hand is way better; way cleaner, way more organized, way more selections to choose from, etc. Logan Airport itself is not a bad airport, but overall there is better airports out there. Logan is in need of improvement though I wouldn't recommend it because there is such a sharp gap between the good and bad here; you may get the really good or the extremely bad.

Bourgas,airport,S Hudson,7/14/2016,Arrival went smoothly at Bourgas but departure was a joke. There were massive queues to check in and then with less than an hour to our departure we had another massive queue to pass through security. There was time for a quick visit to the toilets before we boarded our flight which was 30 mins late taking off due to the chaos. If we had wanted to purchase duty free there was no time and all the shops seemed empty. We were grateful that we did not book the VIP Lounge as we not have been able to use it.,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Bourgas,airport,Ann Bennett,9/24/2015,"The airport has undergone and complete refurbishment, no complaints there. Our return flight was at 7.20am the terminal was very quiet. From our first encounter with check-in woman, through security and passport check, every one of the airport staff were surly to be the point of being rude. Check-in desk woman put her hand up to my face when I asked if we had seats allocated together. She never spoke one word, just raised her hand to silence me then slammed boarding passes on the counter. Next the girl before security ripped boarding passes from me, tore them in two and practically threw them back. Completely unnecessary. The woman who searched me indicated with gestures for me to raise my arms, turn around and then dismissed me with a flick of the hand. Last was the dour faced man checking passports. Again not one single word of acknowledgement, just a backward not of the head which I assumed meant 'you can pass'. Awful staff.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

A ramp had been put in at the rear of the plane for her to get off of by way of a wheel chair. Young lad by the name of Oliver was her helper in this. Walked us through passport and customers. He asked where we were parked. I had 2 cases and 2 small bass on a trolley. He took us all the way to where our car was parked.

Bournemouth,airport,Shaun Mills,2/24/2020,"As a favour to my very good friends who were having a short break in Malta following 25yrs of being together i offered to drop them off at the airport, their flight was at 1pm so we arranged i would drop them off at 11am to save them having to pay for a taxi. I had never done this before and as they were literally travelling with two small pieces of cabin luggage the plan was to drop and run as you would expect, however once my friends had got out of the car i was forced by a very unsympathetic car park attendant (we will call him that to be polite) into the car park as apparently that was what you need to do for drop offs. I had assumed there would be a tiny window of time for such purposes (i.e. 5mins or so) which would be free of charge but i was then charged an extortionate fee of £3 for literally taking a token from the entrance barrier and going straight to the payment machine! I think this is absolutely disgusting and just another way of ripping the public off when they are trying to do someone a favour, there definitely should be a small area for these sort of situations allowing people the 10-20 seconds it takes for someone to get out of the vehicle and collect their baggage from the boot and then leave. When i confronted the 'car park attendant' about this he just shrugged his shoulders and said 'that what it is' with absolutely no sympathy at all, although it is only £3 i feel like i have been robbed as all i needed to do was turn around an leave but as there was another car coming up behind me i did as this man said but had no idea i was going to be charged for obliging him. As you can gather I'm still fuming about this so wanted too make a formal complaint about it and will be contacting the airport directly as well once i can get through .... there is plenty of space there for a drop off point to be put in place so completely outrageous as far as I'm concerned!!!!",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bournemouth,airport,Paul Smith,3/12/2019,"Departure. We often fly from Bournemouth, because it is convenient for us. In comparison to other regional airports it is backward. Luckily my wife and I had no hold luggage on our last flight, so we were able to avoid the long queues at the luggage check-in desk.There are no auto baggage check-in machines, as there are, for instance, at Bristol Airport. The cafes ability to provide a good service is widely variable and on one occassion the simple act of obtaining a coffee and snack was a ""flustered staff"" ordeal. There are not enough staff at the gate, resulting in slow loading of passengers and the solo girl was struggled to cope, when a passenger problem occurred. Arrival. Very poor. No auto passport machines, where on average it takes five minutes to pass. Bournemouth has three desks with border officials, average time to pass is about 10 to 15 minutes if towards the middle/back of the queue. Make sure that you arrive at Bournemouth airport with pounds sterling, as there is no ATM at the arrivals terminal. If you need cash for a taxi, you have to walk to the departures terminal to get it! Transport by bus is not available on weekend afternoons after about 14:30. £3:50 to drop off passengers, which is also added to taxi fares. Conclusion. An underfunded, for profit only airport, which has failed to modernise. It has very little attraction for those who have wider airport experiences.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Made to stand for 1hr and 20 minutes a lot of this time outside, freezing cold. There was absolutely no reason that we could not have waited in relative comfort at the gate. The airport is small but so unorganised. Only 3 flights leaving at the time we departed, they couldn't even look after the customers that were there. I also flew into Bournemouth, arrived at 5pm, the arrivals Hall was absolutely freezing with no facilities and the main departure hall had not one place open to get provisions whilst awaiting collection.

Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,11/23/2008,"I transited changing planes on my way from Fortaleza to Rio so can speak of only one part of the airport. That part was old-looking (maybe 70s retro-style) and cramped. The circular donut-shaped design with one wall between the central area and the boarding gates limited space so that if you had to walk between gates you needed to cut through lines of people waiting for every flights. The fact that this was a Friday afternoon when parliamentarians may have been fleeing Brasilia to return to their home towns may have exacerbated the situation. To me it looked like an older smaller airport in the midwestern U.S. that could call itself international due to one or two flights a day to Canada. Just one area in which to buy food (mainly snacks) with a long line. The rest of the airport including check-in area may be nice but my reaction to the gate area was What a dump.""",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Brasilia,airport,F Costa,8/1/2008,Considering the standard for Brazilian Airports the Capital's is very modern. Good options for shopping and eating and even some cinema theaters.

I almost missed my flight, my son had a panic because the woman from security thought that my fpdl.eu form was not completely ok. I did it again in front of her but she rejected the new one. Finally she called somebody who told her to let us go. Very bad experience, conflict, stress and frustration and running crazily to catch the plane.

At security the “lady” was really rude, and looked at us like we are a piece of dirt because we don’t speak the Slovak language. She was not able to ask one question in a English which would be the minimum to speak at least basic English if you apply to work at an international airport and especially in the capital city. She went through all of our bags, which we would’ve been more than helpful to show her just because of the lack of her English, that she was not able to ask for it. It is highly unacceptable from staff especially that she was unexpectedly and unreasonably rude as well as from the airport for employing such unprofessional employees.

Bremen,airport,J Barnes,11/22/2024,"Perfectly tidy airport that is well connected to the city, making it perfectly comfortable to arrive at. Unfortunately, the departures side of the airport leaves a lot to be desired. There is only one Duty Free store, with limited range and bad prices. The options for food and drink are also poor - after security the only options are a small bar for beer and a snack kiosk. The WiFi service is fine, but only if you’re in the tiny part of the airport where it seems to work - most of the time you’ll find the WiFi network nonexistent, which made the idea of doing any work a nonstarter. Particularly bad is the area past the immigration kiosks. The only amenities there are vending machines which charge nearly €5 for a bottle of coke, with nowhere to fill up water bottles or even to get a bad coffee. The terminal itself is draughty when there are gates in use, which is particularly noticeable in cold weather. All in all a very disappointing experience.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Bremen,airport,Keith Partington,1/15/2008,I agree with Jurgen Arnold regarding this airport and its proximity to the lovely city of Bremen. I flew there last year on Easyjet to and from London Luton but they don't do the route anymore it seems. Squeezed out by the inferior product from Ireland I guess so the comment about other low- cost competition may be a pipe dream. Now if Easyjet were to try again from Gatwick they may give Ryanair a fright. My advice to Jurgen when next departing this lovely airport is to use the facilities in the main terminal first (much nicer and not much blue!) before travelling to Ryanair's plastic chairs at the last possible minute.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Bremen,airport,Jurgen Arnold,10/8/2007,As living in the north of The Netherlands Bremen airport is a good alternative for Amsterdam. Recently flown from the new low cost Ryanair terminal. Its basic clean and blue! There is a multipurpose shop which sells everything from a to z at somewhat inflated prices and small coffee shop. Seating is mostly in plastic chairs which you could find at your local dentist. Reasonable but we had an early flight so it was not so crowded. Would not like to be there when its get full. There are also some paid internet terminals. The airport is well situated from the city center and freeway from the parking garage you are within 3 minutes in the main terminal building. Bremen is still a great small airport but they need to get some other low cost airlines on board besides Ryanair.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE

There was absolutely no excuses/reasons given for this - to us, the airport system is an absolute disgrace and a total frustration. Arriving at the airport at the start of our holiday took 1 and a quarter hours to get out. This airport is an absolute shocker.

The exit queue was cordoned off with 'line strapping' that went for (estimation) one kilometer! From the far side, around a carousel, up down, up down, up down! The amount of people in line was unbelievable, but what was obvious is that Brisbane International Airport and the amount of staff cannot cope with the volume of international flights arriving.

There is no lift then you have to walk for an eternity to get to the baggage carousel. I felt really sorry for anybody that was elderly Or has a little bit of problem walking, why didn’t they put in travelators? Like they have other airports. Car parked in the silver zone costs a fortune. I wasn’t aware they move your car after you parked it! Dropping the keys off before your holidays is easy, it’s not so easy getting them back, yet again another queue with those stupid up-and-down tapes. Only two people and a very long queue. Only one person per party allowed to pick the keys up the rest have to stay outside! What happens if it’s raining? Do they just get wet?

Small area to play for kids, and you just walk about 200 meters to the airplane which will be parked directly in front of the departure hall. Very convenient, quick security check and baggage drop off and it's easily accessible with both car and public transport (bus), which will depart twice every hour and will take you about 30 minutes to downtown.

Chaotic parking facilities, no logic, no system, poor planning. Coming back from holiday once, we saw the car next to ours in the ""premium"" parking right in front of the terminal building had been broken into with a smashed side window. The poor people had to drive all the way back to the Netherlands with a broken window. Not even a note from the airport staff offering an explanation or a solution. There's a picture on the internet of a car being lifted out of a CRL airport parking by crane, having had all its wheels stolen. Funny for most, not great for the people whose car it was. CRL's location so close to Charleroi certainly doesn't help. In the most recent example of CRL mayhem, the entire airport staff went on a 2 day wildcat strike, shutting down the entire airport for a full 2 days, causing significant inconvenience, cost and distress to some 60,000 passengers.

We are encouraged to check in 3 hours early which means I spent 9 hours at that airport. Ridiculous. No airport services available. I wish I could include a photo of how busy the airport departure waiting areas were - thousand people with no where to go, nothing to buy, not even. coffee or bottled water. I felt sorry for the parents and all the small children laying all over the floors.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Buenos Aires Aeroparque,airport,Rich Jenkins,2/2/2020,"Lines everywhere. LATAM has e-checkin but functionally everything is manual. They seem to do their best with a lousy system. The lines seemed to be a function of families having major malfunctions. My check-in took no time at all. It was a long walk to the actual gates. Security was not bad. Many places to eat-local, Starbucks, KFC. They don't seem to use jetways even though they were present and I was on an early morning mainline flight. Arrival was no better-cattle car bus from the plane, long wait for luggage and lines everywhere. The taxi to the center is just a little more than the Liendo shuttle.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Buenos Aires Aeroparque,airport,13 reviewsO Davidson,3/13/2018,"The worst thing about this airport is the heavy use of remote stands and buses. All three of my movements used them and that always means a bad airport but it was even worse here because they never sent enough buses, leaving passengers standing on the tarmac or at the bottom of escalators, plus the roads on the tarmac were crowded and buses and other vehicles would just stop on the roads anywhere, plus the drivers were maniacs. The most horrible airport boarding buses that I’ve seen. Otherwise, it was good. I experienced the airport in the morning, midday and evening and it was never really crowded and check-in, security and emigration were fast. However, the signage in the airport is terrible - I even saw two signs directing to one of the gates that were pointing in completely opposite directions. Just remember that there are two widely-spaced check-in areas and that there are also multiple departure entrances. Customer service staff were helpful. ID is checked at check-in, security and boarding. People line up very early for boarding (even though some airlines are strict about boarding by rows) and the queues block corridors. There are a few decent cafes and shops on both sides of security, some with water views. Wifi generally worked ok. If they stopped using buses, this would be a good airport. Still better than Ezezia and much closer to the city (I got a taxi over to Palermo for lunch during a long layover - less than $150 each way).",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Buenos Aires Aeroparque,airport,J Cooper,7/25/2017,"Chaotic check in for Latam flights. Long lines, few staff working. Airport itself is ok. Once through security, lots of seating available and food stands. Not enough information screens so be prepared to walk to check on departure times and ever changing gates. Many aircraft are reached by bus as there are a limited number of jetways.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Buenos Aires,airport,11 reviewsP Hayes,11/27/2023,"Domestic arrivals quick and easy. No hold-ups at Baggage Reclaim or delays getting into Arrivals Hall. International Departures in separate building which looks like it has just been finished (Nov 2023) with a number of Islands with associated Check-in Desks and machines all on one level. Relatively quick and then onwards to Departures which are up a set of escalators leading directly to a small but efficient security scan area. Beyond that was Passport Control split into Argentinian passport holders and everyone else. Not much of a queue and things moved quickly into the Departure Lounge. Selection of shops selling local things, duty free big named alcohol/cigarettes etc. spreading out left & right as the gates were all along one side looking out towards the apron and taxiways. Friendly helpful staff at the food cafe with good snack/food selection available. Clear announcements and reasonable departure boards around the lounge area. Boarding process quite slick with separate, clearly labelled queues. Quite a long taxi to the runway. Pretty good airport for the capital city gateway to the country.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Buenos Aires,airport,S Galerte,3/13/2023,"I flew into EZE and out of EZE a week later, international flights for both. The arrivals process took about an hour and the lines moved slowly, but the staff was proactive in getting us through the process as quickly as possible, including by waving us over to the Argentine Citizen lanes once all the citizens were processed. Departure, however, was a considerably worse experience. The signs on the road into the airport clearly state that all international departures check in at Terminal A, so that's where my taxi driver took me. However, it turns out that Delta and Aerolineas Argentinas international departures check in at Terminal C, so I had to make the 5 minute walk over there in the hot sun (it was in the 90s Fahrenheit that day). After arriving at Terminal C I changed into long sleeved clothing because I was flying somewhere much colder; however, the Air Conditioning in the buildings was poor, so I sweated through my clothing very quickly just while waiting to check my bag. Finally, it seems that EZE has a rule that nobody can bring liquids over 100 mL onto a plane going to the United States. This rule seems was enforced on all flights to the US. But I have not seen that rule enforced on flights to the US from Europe or Asia, so it seems like it's airport (or at least Argentina) specific. It was incredibly annoying because it meant that I couldn't take any water with me on the plane. Unfortunately, if you're visiting Buenos Aires from very far away you'll likely have no choice but to use EZE. But be prepared for confusing directions, poor climate control, and stricter security protocols then you'll see elsewhere.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Buenos Aires,airport,M Shaw,2/18/2020,"Very clean airport and great lounges. However, prepare to be ignored if you don’t speak Spanish. Check in queues are pathetic and need review. Modern display boards work well but show random and irrelevant times. Staff are very unfriendly and not able to help with anything.",NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
Buenos Aires,airport,Rich Jenkins,2/2/2020,"Modern but has poor circulation in and out. The wait for immigration was glacial and there was a customs form that wasn't collected. The line for the bank to change money was glacial. Terminal B (the location for the shuttle into the city) is really just a kiosk in front of the back entrance for terminal C some distance away. The taxi ride from the center was about US$20 plus tolls. Departure was relatively easy which may have been a reflection of being a Saturday afternoon, although there were few places to sit while waiting for the airline to begin check-in. Few places to eat or shop in the departure area. Note that there is no exchange after immigration so you must change money when you check-in with the airline.the selection of goods post-immigration was disappointing and you cannot take water onto flights. The lounge used by Star Alliance was ok with a range of things to eat. The same vendor runs the lounge for Delta and American which I would assume are similar. Bathrooms were in need of better upkeep. Not the worst of airports but one I'd happily never use again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Buenos Aires,airport,4 reviewsR Sanyal,1/21/2020,"The airport is quite a distance from the City. It took me about 45 minutes. It is a modern airport with all the services you expect. Let me speak first about the arrival. We arrived early in the morning. Other flights had arrived too. The lines snaked and coiled for passengers to clear immigration. It took nearly an hour. That, however, was enough time for our checked luggage to arrive in baggage claim. Our bags were put through a scanning machine by customs and we stepped out from shops to a concourse full of tranportation services. We purchased a taxi service (USD30.00) to our hotel. A taxi driver escorted us out of the terminal building, made us wait at a spot while he went off to fetch his taxi. It all worked. On departure, which was late at night, we arrived in the evening. Check in was smooth. Security check was also smooth. Lines to get your passport stamped again on departure moved fast. The American Airlines lounge was jammed with people what with five flights to the U.S. departing in a short span of time. The lounge offered a large variety of food and drinks but not enough place sit and relax. Only one major shop selling duty free items. Very few, if any, ""Made in Argentina"" products except for wine. There is a McDonald's. As is the case, an additional security check is conducted just before boarding the flight to the U.S. with the carry on bags opened up by security men and women wearing rubber gloves. There are quite a few chairs in the departure area. This is the primary airport to enter Argentina - so if you are visiting this country, it is next to impossible to avoid it. I would be happy not to use this airport again.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Buenos Aires,airport,Pablo Toledo,12/31/2019,"The rather new terminal C is very nice if you go left instead of right after you go through immigration! We didn’t know, and we went right which was just one restaurant basic and ugly! Before boarding the plane we went left and it was a whole different world, nice wine bars, restaurants, shops, etc.! Then we had to board; the terminal has 22 gates with Jet Bridges, but we had to take a bus to the plane under heavy rain, even though our plane was the only one departing!",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Buffalo,airport,S Danes,10/29/2023,"Getting through this airport was such a breeze, our home airport is Pearson, which is insanely busy. We were able to apply for TSA cares for our autistic family, Tameeka helped us from start to finish of security and was so warm and thoughtful in helping us navigate their first time through! Highly recommend using this service if you have a family member with disabilities. We applied for the same program at Orlando and no one helped us, the staff were rude and the lady guarding the family and disabled line tried to turn us away. Thoroughly disappointed especially compared to Buffalo! We will definitely be flying out of Buffalo in the future!",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Buffalo,airport,2 reviewsTyler Patterson,9/30/2015,The Buffalo Niagara Airport was quite an experience. It was easily accessible and was fantastic with the hotels right across the road.

Overall it was a nice experience.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Bujumbura,airport,A Sharma,10/29/2013,The most basic airport I have been to. Having been brought up in Burundi and been travelling there and back to the UK over several years I think this airport has gone downhill. Many years ago this was an exciting airport. People could see you off from the observation balcony but gone are the days! My dad wasn't even allowed into the airport to see me off. Airport staff will make your life hell just to say your last good byes to family. My Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi was slightly delayed coming into the airport due to a power cut! I have never experienced anything like it! My arrival into the airport was just as bad with airport staff wanting to open all bags and wanting bribes in order to keep things. Thank god my family had airport entry passes which meant we weren't left short changed. In all honesty I would still recommend as it's just a crazy yet brilliant experience!,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,H Mandell,4/9/2020,"BUR is a no frills, no wow, no stress airport and those are the best things about it. Easy to park with valet, getting through security is usually a breeze and there is little fog to cause delays. There's a Peet's coffee and the cafe is overpriced but decent. Do you really expect fine dining on what is primarily a short haul airport, basically an SWA airport? Other than the charming 1950's air about the place, you get on and off the planes old school style, with stairs and with SWA, can enter through the front of back of the plane, the latter to avoid the slow pokes. SWA boarding lines are well organized If I were to complain, the rest rooms are smallish and Terminal B for United is too small. Seating can be somewhat tight close to boarding time. Baggage claim is usually reasonably fast but there are only two carousels, so don't dawdle. If you are going to the westside or even downtown, you're in for a long cab ride but most travelers live in one of the nearby valleys and if you're a tourist, it's close to Universal Studios. There's a train within walking distance that will take you downtown or to Ventura County during limited times. Overall, a very good travel experience because it is easy and stress free.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,11 reviewsK Garman,6/18/2019,"Security took about 5 mins. Checked in online but the line to check in didn't look long.

Didn't have to use WiFi.",POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,11/18/2013,Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal. One walks up a sort of sideways V shaped ramp to get to one's plane (I think they may offer use of umbrellas if it rains).,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,9/8/2011,Bob Hope Airport as it is formally known is small and easy to navigate. Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus. You can also take one of the parking shuttles to the nearby Metrolink/Amtrak rail station.,POSITIVE,NEUTRAL
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,Joaquin Quinto,11/5/2008,Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns.

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,J Segal,1/30/2008,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE

Then my boarding pass was checked again. 15 min. waiting time at customs control. Then the customs officer said that self-printed boarding passes are not okay, and sent me back to check-in counter.

Burgas,airport,Gelash Frey,7/26/2019,"Check in and check out was okay, quick enough. But the customs officers were arrogant, with unfriendly faces. Also some people who were selling at the airport kiosks. This is not reflective of Bulgaria because in the hotels, the receptionists seemed very cordial and service oriented. Please let those customs officers get a public relations course because they are the postcard of your country. It felt like one was facing a maximum Jail officer than a customs officer in an airport.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL

Cagliari,airport,S Shaw,9/14/2020,"The only complaint is the lack of logic in boarding flights. In COVID time would be ideal to board from seat number starting from the back of the plane in order to avoid contact with people seating in front rows. In Cagliari don’t seem to know at all this method that we have experienced at Heathrow airport and Fiumicino airport as well. We tried to suggest it to the airport staff doing the boarding but they seem clueless and helpless. Big crowd gathering at the same time with no proper queue and security distance. I wish a manager at Cagliari airport would have the kindness to reply and explain why. It would be so easy to update the system and believe me, the boarding will be quicker and safer. Thank you.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
Cagliari,airport,Tony McLaughlin,6/26/2019,"This is a European regional airport, and a tale of two airports really. The non-Schengen flights come from Gatwick (BA) Stansted and Dublin (Ryanair) as well as a flight from Moscow. When all four arrive at roughly the same time, Passport Control is chaotic. There were two snake queues, those with identity Cards only were ushered into one, and those with Passports ushered into another. A third queue then formed and this is where the chaos began, and people were jumping from queue to queue. The departing situation was a lot better. Quite a busy departures area, but nicely designed. The gates for the non-Schengen destinations are 20 – 23. Passengers can go here straight away and clear Passport Control. Once through Passport Control, Ryanair passengers should head downstairs to gates 22 & 23, while BA passengers should wait in the lounge just through Passport Control. Not sure where the Mosco flight departs from. I doubt if I will be travelling here again anytime soon, but departing from this airport is much better than arriving at it.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

Cairns,airport,C Steve,4/11/2024,"Cairns International Airport is little more than an oversized bus shelter. Whilst one concedes that it is a low-usage terminal with less than 8 flights per day (excluding mining charters), there is a lot that can be done to improve this airport. There is a distinct lack of working charging ports, noting that the USB ports adjacent to the cafe have been disabled. Tables and chairs are dirty/sticky. There is only one very expensive and oversubscribed café (ie, long queues to purchase over-priced, average quality food). There is one duty free store if that is your thing. There was a business lounge several years ago, but it has been long vacated with no immediate plans to reopen (this might change if there are more flights from full-service carriers in the future). There is no seating whatsoever near the boarding gates. There was no wi-fi coverage during my visit. On the positive front, customs/immigration/quarantine both on departure and arrival are rapid and staffed by friendly officials. It's a vast improvement on the horrendous queues in SYD, MEL and BNE. But as far as I'm concerned this is the only reason to transit through CNS Intl. In short, once you clear customs there is nothing of any interest, and no Wi-Fi coverage. A very drab and uninteresting terminal building with very little going for it.",NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL
