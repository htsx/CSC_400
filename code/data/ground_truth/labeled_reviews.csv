Aalborg,airport,3 reviewsThomas Rune Knudsen,9/16/2023,"This airport is always a breeze. Small and compact but with ok facilities considering the size. Staff is (almost) always friendly and down-to-earth. Few if any lines. Clean, and good Wi-Fi. They might need security in the baggage reclaim as two toddlers got on the belt just as it started moving. Seemed very dangerous, and the parents were present but completely oblivious. Never seen such bad parenting at an airport before. The family was Danish. Parking is no longer free, but 20 DKK per day. A very silly move.",NEUTRAL
Aalborg,airport,Roeland Heitz,1/6/2019,"Worst and most chaotic airport transfer I have ever experienced. In spite of low costs, I will never fly with Aeroflot again! Is this 2019 or still the 70’s?",NEGATIVE
Aalborg,airport,Don Shaw,6/7/2018,"The best airport in the world. I have used it multiple times, and there is never any significant waiting time at check-in or security. The staff are always good-natured and friendly. Parking is free. It is quiet. Duty-free items are cheaper than in e.g. Copenhagen. And on top of all this you get free water and a newspaper while you wait for the plane. The best by far.",POSITIVE
Aalborg,airport,4 reviewsAnnika Fredenstrand,3/19/2017,"The baggage claim areas have obviously been merged to one since I last flew into Aalborg Airport with luggage. When coming to the only baggage claim area in the airport, in the end of the airport, where only airlines like Norwegian used to deliver luggage, there were no signs what so ever of our SK1207 luggage arriving - and thus I stepped out of the baggage claim area - not able to reenter - and with a tiresome wait for some 30 minutes until the airport staff had located my luggage. Better signs and maybe announcements - would do a big difference!",NEGATIVE
Aalborg,airport,Klaus Malling,2/11/2014,"A small very effective airport with few flights. Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well. There is a nice viewing pavilion at one end of the airport. Outside note the famous ""kiss and goodbye signs"". Restrooms outside terminal however few.",POSITIVE
Aalborg,airport,S Kroes,2/13/2013,This is a nice and modern airport at the moment they are expanding the airport so there is a lot of building going on but in the departure area you will not notice this very much. The Airport has got free Wifi and a small restaurant with shop on the land side. Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.,POSITIVE
Aalborg,airport,M Andersen,8/7/2012,A very nice airy terminal - that seems modern enough. Free WIFI and free parking. Everything within walking distance. Most people travel domestic to Copenhagen but a rising number of international routes e.g. AAL-AMS makes for a lot of possibilities. Check-in is very quick and so is Security. All in all a nice experience.,POSITIVE
Aalborg,airport,Paul Van Alsten,5/22/2011,AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.,POSITIVE
Aalborg,airport,K Fischer,8/4/2010,Very quick check-in and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.,NEUTRAL
Aalborg,airport,M Larsen,3/26/2009,Aalborg Lufthavn (AAL) is a smallish airport near the city of Aalborg. There is not usually a lot of people leaving or arriving at any one time so there is hardly ever any time wasted standing in line for check-in or security checks - brilliant! A very friendly and inviting atmosphere overall.,POSITIVE
Aarhus,airport,Don Shone,3/3/2017,"This place is a dump. Miserable place with very few facilities, they rip you off with the car parking, and rip you off with the food and drink (coffee costs at least 29 kr). Duty free is small with few items and is expensive. Aalborg airport is 10 times better.",NEGATIVE
Aarhus,airport,Paul Hastie,11/29/2004,Nice small friendly airport. Good transport links to the city by bus which meets flights and plenty of taxis. A few shops and cafes and very clean facilities.,POSITIVE
Abbotsford Intl,airport,L Meade,1/3/2024,"Terrible staff, terrible experience.  It first started at the restrooms when one cleaning lady closed off both the men's and women's. Although she was clearly still cleaning the men's, a casual inquiry as to if I could use the women's restroom in the meantime was dismissed in a very rude and condescending manner. Even just the decency of politely pointing me to a different restroom would have been much more appreciated. Next, there was no one at the Flair counter managing bags or check ins. Some of us approached another staff if they could contact or follow up on the counter personnel. Again, rudely dismissed instead of kindly explaining any situation. After that, I began to manage some of my personal belongings at a seating area. A cleaning lady in her phone started sweeping at my feet and completely ignoring me while wiping the floor literally where I was standing and managing my stuff. She clearly could have waited until I was done before doing that right where I was standing or at the very least say ""excuse me"". Finally, at the checkout security there were two lines and as I approached, I even asked if I could line up there. She said yes, and after putting down my belongings in bins, she asked me to move to the next security line because they were down a personnel. Individually, maybe these incidents may be small, but the collective experience together with how the staff addressed situations were generally rude and dismissive.",NEGATIVE
Abbotsford Intl,airport,Doreen Roper,9/12/2023,"I used the Ladies Restroom in the terminal and it was filthy, the cubicle reeked of urine and the wash basin area had not been cleaned in awhile. I expect more of public airport spaces and have never encountered such a dirty restroom.",NEGATIVE
Abbotsford Intl,airport,D Mitchell,5/8/2022,I am mobility challenged and was told I would be a priority boarding. When priority boarding was announced all passengers lined up and were put through and boarded regardless so those of us that needed the extra time were greatly inconvenienced. I was also told it was a very short walk but I had to stop and catch my breath 3 times. I would not fly swoop again.,NEGATIVE
Abbotsford Intl,airport,Bryan Wang,10/8/2019,"Since most flights to and from YXX are ULCC's, my expectations are low. Lack of flight info signs. Queuing times are non-existent. Clean terminal with easy seating. Lack of shops and food inside the secure area. Wi-Fi is poor.",NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,Raneide Wilkins,1/13/2024,"My review of Aberdeen Airport is regarding the lack of options when it comes to travel. Not many options and not many airlines offering any destination from Aberdeen, This airport has been upgraded and I still don't see why, if no extra destinations have been added for travelers. Aberdeen has become one of the poorest Scotland destinations on so many levels. I am local and used to travel loads but not anymore as the flight option has declined over the years. Another big problem in Aberdeen and Aberdeen airport is the lack of taxis and the extortionate car parking charges.",NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,E Morran,12/2/2023,"Going through airport with sunflower lanyard. Staff are trained to see it and be more ""caring and patient"" but obviously, they just happened to be blind to it again. After many years of travelling through this awful place, I've had enough. Before covid, this airport was decent. The staff were usually friendly, helpful and could have a laugh. But recently, there were only two people who were decent. The rest were either miserable or visibly too terrified to speak. It's possible they were on edge and looking for someone or maybe their bosses were watching. It was interesting that 10+ people in a row beeped at the metal detector as well. Everything was so tense that myself and many others were talking back to the staff when they were trying to boss us about. One person almost started a fight. It also didn't help that one guy cut in front of me, put his stuff in my tray then walked off. The staff saw it, allowed it and walked away when I tried to question it. I was thinking that time was running out for my flight because I was given the wrong time on my boarding pass so obviously I was getting impatient. Tried to shove this guy's stuff onto the conveyer and got shouted at by a miserable so-and-so. Of course, I retaliated. Of course they walked away. Check-in: Miserable as always. Security: one decent, one terrified and the rest miserable. Gate staff: Miserable and one was sneezing over everything. Aberdeen Airport drains the life out of everyone. There are many people in this world. Some happy, some miserable, etc. But how can one place filled with so many different people consistently hold so many miserable people? I believe they're either so bored or so horrible that they enjoy making it a miserable experience. Then they have the gall to say ""Enjoy your flight/Thanks for X"". Best to just say the bare minimum and quietly get through it. Aberdeen is a pathetic place in general especially when it comes to transport.",NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,Daniel Omnes,7/1/2023,"I am writing after some weeks and with reflection of this incident. I am 82 years old and I was travelling alone to Amsterdam. At security I found myself vulnerable due to some rude behaviour from security staff. I complied with what was asked as there is zero tolerance however what I would ask is some consideration on 'courtesy and politeness' to local and international travellers at the same time which is the basics in behaviour. I have travelled widely, and this is the standard in all airports but why not in Aberdeen? There are some good people but the 2 staff members from security have tarnished the image for the whole team and department in Aberdeen, which is unfair.",NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,Margaret Ferguson,2/23/2023,"Firstly, let me say that the Special Assistance Team at Aberdeen are THE BEST. Helpful, accommodating and friendly, nothing too much trouble. It's the rest of the airport which lets them down! We were on a Tui flight due to fly at 2.50pm The check-in board said check-in opens at 12.20. We joined the queue at 12.15. No sign of any staff at the desks. A person in what may have been Tui colours appeared at one of the desks, shuffled some papers, walked away. Another person in airport livery then approached the desk, looked at the papers, and walked off. The check-in desk actually opened, by ONE of the two staff at a different desk than advertised at 12.30. A minute later, a guy joined at an adjacent desk After check-in, security. The lady on the desk said I'd asked for assistance so should have a wheel chair. I didn't need one for this airport, just help with the steps to the plane. Nope, she said it was the rule, and sent me back to the assistance desk. Assistance guy escorted me back to security and explained that it wasn't quite the rule, Through security, to a very quiet shopping mall. Down the steps to the departure lounge. There is a small lift thing, but I'm scared of it, Would you believe the coffee shop at departures was closed. There is a soft drinks and confectionary machine but no coffee. Hubby then went back up the stairs and eventually found a coffee shop open in the mall, I realise that the airport was not busy, which is odd for a Saturday. But really, to not have an open coffee shop or indeed not to show it closed before the departure lounge, is poor. Maybe we are all expected to pay the exorbitant fee for the Northern Lights lounge. The next problem was indeed the departure. I don't know whose fault this is, whether Tui or airport administration, but it's at least inefficient. The departure board said gate opens 2.15. We could see the plane on its usual stance-It comes from Tenerife, gets cleaned, turns round and goes back I believe. We had been told gate 1. We got there at about 2.20 and were taken to the plane lift when the flight was eventually announced. We waited in the lift at the emergency door, for a good five minutes until the door was opened. By this time it was 2.35. We could see the queue of passengers for the other doors, in the cold wind and gathering clouds. There were babies and toddlers in that queue. As an aside, this stance is one of the farthest away from the terminal. BA flights have covered walkways from the terminal itself. Maybe it's something to do with landing fees, for which I believe Aberdeen is expensive. Eventually we were allowed to board. The plane was absolutely perfectly clean I have to say. Just unfortunate for those poor passengers who had to wait so long in the cold, with young children. All in all a poor airport experience",NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,1 reviewsIan Geddes,6/18/2022,Arrived in plenty of time to check in so went for a cup of coffee. It's been a while since I have used this airport so there were big changes from the last time. Went to the bar/café at 14.05 to be told that they closed at 14.00 and the tills were locked. If I wanted coffee I would have to wait till I was through security I have used airports all over the world and have never known a bar or restaurant to close during the day. Added to the non availability of seats unless you needed assistance it provided a worse service than airports in third world countries. I will be using Inverness in future as my airport of choice. Aberdeen airport is an absolute embarrassment for a so called international airport.,NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,C Hurley,5/27/2022,"The security staff at Aberdeen airport are not up to standard. Many of them are aggressive and argumentative and their main aim is not to be friendly or courteous. I have been fortunate enough to travel to many countries and I say, without hesitation that the security staff at Aberdeen airport are either the most poorly trained that I have encountered or that they are paying no attention to the training they receive. The management team needs to review the training of the security staff at Aberdeen airport urgently.",NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,Jo Lenate,3/3/2022,"Staff at the security are extremely rude and abusive. Aberdeen airport security staff (especially a lady and a man (both middle-aged)) should be re-trained to not to shout at passengers, they seem not to enjoy their job at all and simply there to abuse passengers! Very upset, very disappointed, I will take the train next time! Never again!",NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,G Protano,7/12/2020,"The airport is clean and easy to go, the price for the drop off is high as 3 GBP. And the security staff need to be educated to dealing with passenger. Some are friendly but some are very rude and abusive. They think to have all the power of the police.",NEUTRAL
Aberdeen,airport,Ian Hughes,2/27/2020,"This truly is an embarrassment to the city. Over 40 years I have lived in Aberdeen and seen minimal improvement, whilst cities like Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh have progressed to modern facilities. £3 to get dropped off, tiny check-in area always with queues, cramped public areas, crammed into a corridor before boarding, no airbridge (who has to walk outside to board a plane these days?), ridiculous luggage reclaim a mile away from anything, stupid obstructions for your luggage trolley outside the airport, a taxi queue rarely with any taxis. Overall a disgrace and no wonder it's been voted UKs third-worst airport.",NEGATIVE
Aberdeen,airport,D Brown,2/5/2020,"Airport is overpriced, it has a serious lack of facilities which those they do have, they want money for. This is the worst airport I have ever travelled through and signs show that it is only getting worse.",NEGATIVE
Abidjan,airport,8 reviewsH Blumenthal,7/27/2021,"When first opened some years ago, it was possibly the best airport in Africa but no more! It is even a true mess. Difficult to find one's way, overcrowded and not very clean anymore. The worse was the boarding of my Air Cote d'Ivoire flight: we had to go down on the tarmac and then walk several hundred yards on very uneven ground, in the middle of service vehicles and planes, with no escort, no security. It is well possible it was the airline's fault (sadly not listed on Skytrax) as Air Cote d'Ivoire's service is absolutely non existent, even for business class passengers.",NEGATIVE
Abidjan,airport,D Sane,12/13/2017,"I have been transiting a few times recently. The airport looks clean, nice and modern, but it's very disorganised. Boarding passes are checked more than five times, while once or twice should be enough. Security screening sees long queues up into the immigration area, due to excessive scrutiny. Transit passengers need to queue to have their boarding pass checked, a practice I haven't seen anywhere else in the world. This all adds to delays, affecting connecting flights as well. For boarding Air Côte d'Ivoire, passengers are asked to wait outside of the terminal, for a bus to the plane, several destinations combined. This kind of takes away the point of checking the boarding pass five times over before completing the boarding process within the terminal. WiFi is free for just half an hour. The terminal is modern and clean, but even at this small size it already looks very overstretched. Lomé Airport does a better job of being a hub in West Africa.",NEGATIVE
Abidjan,airport,Simon Gooch,5/3/2016,"I have been through Abidjan a few times and whilst I was impressed on my first visit, progressive improvements since then mean that it is definitely the best airport I have been to in Africa. There is now decent and free wifi in the departures area, a comfortable new cafe and the information boards are clear.",POSITIVE
Abidjan,airport,Anoma Yao,6/30/2014,Small airport but modern and clean facility. No hustlers in the terminal unlike in most African airports. Not much queuing at check-in immigration and security. Air-conditioning functions toilets are clean airbridges and no pax busses but poor amenities: no wifi tiny duty free zone and unattractive lounge.,NEUTRAL
Abidjan,airport,Pedro Gil,12/20/2006,I frequently travel through this airport and would note a couple of problems in an otherwise nice facility. First I've arrived on another airline and been unable to get help in the transit lounge from Air I'voire even though they are my next flight. You have to get somebody to take you to the front desk through a little back hallway and tip them. Second if you go through the passport desk they have plain clothed policemen without badges who demand your passport in the luggage area without identifying themselves. The restaurant in the departure area is much nicer than the one outside the ticket area where you check in.,NEGATIVE
Abidjan,airport,Grant Macpherson,5/28/2005,I've been through ABJ Airport a number of times over the last couple of years and consider it the best airport in West / Central Africa possible one of the newest. Very clean and friendly with good security. Customs and Immigration take a while to get through but post 9/11 it's no worse than in the States or Europe. Air france the main carrier to/from Europe has additional security prior to boarding the plane. Check in staff and airport Staff both landside and airside very helpfull generally very good Duty Free taking both CFA Euro Dollars and credit cards,POSITIVE
Abidjan,airport,M Meiners,5/14/2005,"I had to visit Abidjan this January. There is no doubt the airport is more than a pleasant surprise: One would expect the worst for any West African ariport in general and even more for this one keeping in mind that the country is fairly isolated and suffering from heavy civil unrest and at the edge of civil war keeping most western travellers and business away. In fact the airport corresponds totally to European counterparts of the same size (fairly small thus). The terminal building is very new and has been totally rebuild in a quite recent past with all confort one can expect: Aircondition normal sanitary facilities and yes all is clean and in good working condition! On arrival jet aircrafts just dock at a direct tunnel connection to the building distances are quite short. All controls are very smooth with absolutely no bribes to give to any official. While standing in line for passport control a ""doctor"" passes trough the lines and checks vaccinations (Yellow fever is compulsory) every where there is security passport control is smooth and efficient although every one tries to be closest to the luggage belt this also goes quite smoothly including inspection of luggage. No unauthorized people in the arrival area and nowhere unpleasant people insisting on ""helping"" you carrying your luggage and then trying to run away with it (apparently some people do have a sort of authorization to enter customs area for helping passengers but not insisting). Departure also is quite smooth: Check in is done in an enclosed area with identity check at the entrance so here also one is safe after checking in there is just a short way up the stairs passing customs and then to the departure hall. Here also with all normal facilities: duty free shop large restaurant area some smaller shops and sanitary facilities still clean and in good working order! Altogether thus a pleasant experience!",POSITIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,Elizabeth Abraham,1/23/2025,This is a very modern airport but they have not thought through all details. There is no place for a non premium tired traveler to stretch their legs and relax. Many of the other supports I've been at have a reclining chair with possibility to stretch legs. Not all of us can afford the lounge or the on sure hotel. 130 usd for 4 hours! Also there are not enough phone and computer charging capabilities in this modern airport. Very disappointed.,NEGATIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,4 reviewsNash Degaonkar,12/13/2024,"The Airport is pretty decent in a lot of aspects. The duty free is vast, the airport staff and security are ultra professional, helped me guide through the terminal on where to find my gate. However, the Wi-Fi experience could have been better, because doing facetime calls was a problem, considering whatsapp is not allowed. Anyhow, it is massive.",NEUTRAL
Abu Dhabi,airport,Maryna Ulgen,11/17/2024,Great airport. Good duty free Good f&b outlets. Just one question - why do you clean all washrooms at the same time leaving just handicapped ones opened? And to find a vacant one you need to pass several kms to find it!,POSITIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,Gary Colburn,10/18/2024,"Super modern airport, bright shiny and very clean. Security control was reasonably quick on departure and arrival and I found the staff professional, although they don't smile a lot. Bonus points for having showers after security, I took one and it was marvellous. I wasn't sold on Abu Dhabi itself but the airport is certainly one of the best I've experienced in recent times.",POSITIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,Stephanie Themis,8/17/2024,Was feeling travel sick after arriving Abu Dhabi airport and while waiting for my next flight Starbucks staff were very helpful and called the medic for me and were very helpful. Helped me recover within hour. Lovely staff,POSITIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,E Marsel,6/11/2024,"On 10th of June I had a connection flight from Abu Dhabi to London at 2pm at gate D43. As I knew there was an additional security check at the gate and it had never been pleasant but this time it was enough uncomfortable to me therefore i decided to share my experience. I was searched by a female security officer and her professionalism was questionable. Her First question was about my mental health. When I answered positively, she laughed. She did my fully body check without asking me about permission. For a whole time she treated me as a suspect not as a customer. She asked me about sharp items and box matches with a joyable voice. She found even my period products very suspicious as well, having a lot of fun in meantime. I had a few security checks before her that day already and a flight. She left me with anxiety level until the roof wishing me a ""good day"". When I decided to pay a good money for a good airline I expected a good customer service at the airport as well.",NEGATIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,S Mitchell,2/29/2024,"Airport may look amazing but passport control for arrivals is a shambles. 3 people on, with massive queues and other staff hanging around chatting. One was even on his phone rather than work",NEGATIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,B Vanetee,2/14/2024,"As inefficient as the old airport. The only thing that has changed is the infrastructure. Self checkin kiosks, gates and shopping are the positives. Staff quality is as pathetic and inefficient as was before. Boarded through gate E. Took almost 45 mins to get to the bus.",NEGATIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,12 reviewsR Purten,10/28/2023,"We have been transiting through this airport for over a decade, during which it has been steadily going downhill. Terminal 1 has spectacular dome architecture and a good variety of cafes. Unfortunately, the quantity of flights transiting through Abu Dhabi means that virtually all now pass through the utilitarian and uninspired Terminal 3. Transiting through this terminal means a long walk from disembarkation to security, then an even longer walk to the next gate. Security check is always jam-packed with long queues in a small area. At least the screening machines are sophisticated (laptops can stay in cases) and security personnel are mostly good-humoured. However, Terminal 3 is not a pleasant place to wait between flights: there are few eating and drinking facilities in evidence. This time we made the mistake of investigating the Al Dhabi Lounge but found it to be overcrowded and dirty.",NEGATIVE
Abu Dhabi,airport,F Montaldo,8/23/2023,Transited two times in Abu Dhabi and I confirm it as the worst airport of my life. Fully packed of people with no place to sit. People sleeping on the floor and leaning on the walls for despair. All the amenities were dirty and stinky. I'll never choose Etihad anymore due to their main airport.,NEGATIVE
Abuja,airport,M Parker,3/5/2017,"Abuja airport is closing on 7 March for 6 weeks until 18 April for reconstruction of the runway. The nearest airport to Abuja during this period is Kaduna a 3 hour drive or train ride away so getting to and from the capital of Nigeria is going to be a big hassle until the airport reopens. The only international airline currently planning to fly into Kaduna is Ethiopian - otherwise you will have to fly to Lagos and take a domestic flight to Kaduna. Abuja airport when reopened is not too bad to use (by Nigerian standards). The international terminal is not very busy so getting through is pretty painless. The domestic terminal is in the same location - check in is on one side of the internatonal terminal (for most airlines) and the actual departures area on the other side so you have to come out of the check in area and then walk past international departures and back into the departures area. The actual departures area is up an external metal staircase which is a bit of a schlep. At the top you re-enter the building go through security and are in the departures area. It's quite large and there is air-conditioning but sometimes it gets very crowded if there are lots of delayed flights (which is very common). There are some lounges you can pay to use for about N2,000 ($4) so that is well worth it if you are facing a long delay as you will get a more comfy seat, cleaner toilets, better airconditioning and a cup of tea and a biscuit. There are a couple of cafes in the main area selling mostly Nigerian food and a few shops selling the sort of things you find in any Nigerian market. To board the domestic flights you have to exit the departures area down another external metal staircase and then get in a bus or walk to your plane depending on how far away it is parked. On arrival you actually come into the International departures and arrivals building where but you have to exit to the outside to locate your transport as only passengers are allowed into the building itself. One irritating thing about the airport is the X ray bag check to enter each building so if you are flying domestic you have to go through this twice entering the building and then a 3rd time when you are going into the departures area. International arrivals can be a slow process if two international flights arrive at the same time as there is only one desk for international passport holders and a lengthy two person process where someone from state security first checks your passport and then passes it to the immigration official. Be aware that on exiting the baggage claim area in both domestic and international areas you may be asked to show your baggage claim tags so they can be compared with the tags on your bags. I can't recommend the airport but if you are travelling to Abuja it is your only option (once it reopens). It is also much easier to use than Lagos international terminal if you are arriving in Nigeria for the first time. A new international terminal is under construction and due to open later this year. At this point the current strangely laid out mixture of domestic and international should become the domestic terminal. To get from the airport to Abuja is about a 40 minute drive down a wide multilane highway. It is best to arrange a pick up in advance to avoid ending up in a rather tatty and potentially unsafe normal taxi at the airport. The cost to Abuja should be between N5,000 to N10,000 depending on the state of the taxi.",NEGATIVE
Abuja,airport,Sumaiya Yakubu,4/25/2016,"For starters Abuja airport was super hot, no air conditioning or at least fans. Everything you do in the airport you pay for yet provision simple services is poor. It also took too long for bags to arrive while there were not enough seats. I am ashamed right now as a Nigerian. Unfriendly staff as well - it needs serious intervention.",NEGATIVE
Abuja,airport,Alan Wan,2/28/2012,On arrival as we flew Business Class we were near the front of the line for immigration. Baggage did not take too long to arrive. Finding a taxi was not obvious but a friendly airport employee walked us across the car park to the taxis - make sure you agree a price in advance. When we departed Abuja although it was quiet and there was no one in front it still took an hour to check-in. Bags had to be x-rayed and PAX go through a metal detector bags then manually weighed and manually searched after which we could check- in. Due to a computer crash boarding cards were manually written - however ground staff later gave out printed cards at the gate. The business lounge was rubbish but at least the sofas were comfy. At the gate all passengers and bags were searched again - by very friendly staff.,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,A Cobo,8/8/2011,Abuja international arrivals greets you with a long immigration line. Only one booth is set up to accommodate a complete flight with another booth for dignitaries and diplomats. One can stand for over 1 hour in this line while the immigration clerk scrutinizes your passport and visa. The people are generally nice and polite the airport is clean. AC is mediocre. International departure was crowded and not very comfortable and in most places extremely hot. Food options are limited. Abuja national terminal is another story. Very hot limited seating not so clean limited food options and crowded. There are no flight departure screens. In general an unkempt image.,NEGATIVE
Abuja,airport,Antonio Tettamanzy,4/14/2011,It was better than expected but can be quite messy sometimes. Currently (April 2011) the road which connects the airport to town is under maintenance and traffic at peak hours is nothing less than crazy so program yourself to go there early. In the passengers lounge there is absolutely nothing to do but a couple of convenience stores to buy soda and crackers. Toilets are decent but with no towels nor soap to wash the hands.,NEUTRAL
Abuja,airport,C Stafford,1/31/2010,Upon arrival from Amsterdam on KLM I went to use the bathroom and there was no garbage can and no toilet paper. The airport was cleaner than I expected. I think it's better than Lagos actually. Our luggage failed to arrive with us and we were told to come back in 3 days time to pick it up! We weren't going to be anywhere near Abuja in 3 days! We were told later by the airline (after we got back to the US) that they should have delivered it to us. (It was a 6 hour drive one way by the way.) Leaving was a nightmare. They had no record of our changed flight days and had no way of checking with our credit card (we were told that's all we would need to verify our changed dates-a credit card.) We were told to step aside while they helped other passengers. Then we were sent to one person who told us to go to another person etc etc. It took two hours to straighten out the mess and that was only because my husband had to beg the woman to let him use her computer so he could check his email which he was sure would have a confirmation of the change. I will say this particular woman was very professional and willing to do whatever it took to help us. Boarding passes were hand-written. Upon checking our baggage the woman typed in LIM instead of ILM which meant our bags were heading for Lima Peru not Wilmington North Carolina! This screw-up was revealed to us upon arriving in Atlanta. Overall not a good experience with the airport or maybe it was just KLM/Delta. Who knows. I was not impressed.,NEGATIVE
Abuja,airport,Mark Bickerton,5/24/2009,The international terminal is nice and quite well organised but there is nothing much to do there. The domestic terminal is madness especially between 4pm and 7pm when many flights depart for Lagos. Its more like an old bus station than an airport and I am not sure the security is that strong (last time I was there the boarding passes were handwritten on small pieces of photocopied paper),POSITIVE
Abuja,airport,S Adewale,3/3/2007,In Nigerian standards relatively clean and organized. However I was bored out of my mind when waiting for my flight because the shopping and entertainment possibilities is nil. Overall and compared to Lagos domestic terminal this airport is paradise on earth.,POSITIVE
Acapulco,airport,Pieter Boone,6/6/2022,"This 'newish' airport is compact, clean, spacious, bright and well designed. I arrived from Dallas. Plane docked at a jet bridge. Quick and short walk to fast and friendly immigration followed by customs. less than 5 minutes plane door to curb. Well managed & safe taxi service with no lines. On the return a similar smooth experience. The airside offers a nice choice of shops, restaurant and lounges. Certainly the small scale makes this airport a joy to use for -limited- international travel. Nice friendly staff everywhere.",POSITIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,Jacob Thomas,3/21/2024,"The facilities are fine. The check in staff at the checkin time is ok. When you reach the boarding gate, they will make you stand in a queue for an unnecessary check to tick the boarding pass with their pen and then make you wait again. The staff at this check point has already interviewed you at the check in counter. They have a rude behaviour and tone and not friendly at all.",NEGATIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,M Addo,6/4/2022,"Corruption Central. Its funny that Kotoko airport has an announcement stating that it doesn't condone the extortion of customers, however does not provide any means of complaints and its scary to complain to the members of staff as they may also try to extort you. Got stopped by the security at the exit on my arrival wanting to know what was in my bag and after finding out there was nothing of worthwhile value they then asked if I could ""bless a brother"". On my return, then got stopped for another ""blessing"" by an immigration officer. Honestly, for such a beautiful airport it downgrades the whole airport and does not send out an inviting message.",NEGATIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,B Triplett,12/13/2021,"This airport, is structurally nice and clean! That's the best part. The staff are super rude, bossy, constantly looking for someone to move or push or tell to do something irrelevant to getting people where they need to go. The instructions received are short and rude! The systems and procedures are non existing, numerous people checking and rechecked and scribbling on your ticket. I had my passport, covid, and boarding pass checked 10 times after security and sitting at the gate, it's not even possible to get to the gate without all of those having been checked?",NEGATIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,H Steensen,8/20/2021,"The airport with the worst business class lounges and partly very corrupt staff. No possibilities to sit in certain areas where it would be a must to have the opportunity. Finding your way within the airport is very difficult, not enough signs to find what you are looking for. Some of the staff is ignorant and arrogant, providing bad service.",NEGATIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,Ama Afari,7/16/2021,"Warning to other travellers using Kotoka airport drop off. There's a deliberate system of entrapment. We arrived at the airport to drop off my friend who was travelling. As she had to pick up a copy of her Covid test result we dropped her off and was told by one of the staff that we should rather drive around to the other side by the bus stop. We drove around the area waiting for her to call us that she was ready so we could drive her to the new side of the airport to catch her flight. When she was ready, we drove to the side of the road (near the bus stop) where the staff member told us to go to. Another member of staff then proceeded to stand by the car, said you can't pick up here and called over two other men who put a clamp on our wheel. This happened in the space of less than 30 seconds. We were shocked of course and told them she would be late for her flight to which he responded he doesn't care. They demanded we pay 150 cedis. While we were talking to the men, several cars parked in the same spot and picked up passengers. We asked why their cars weren't being clamped too. They stood by and let these cars pick up and drive off. They continued to refuse to unclamp our car. We paid the 150 cedis because we didn't want our friend to miss her flight. The attendant then tried to refuse to give us a receipt for the fine we just paid which led to more arguing. During this time one of the attendants used his hand to push our brother who then pushed him back. Us ladies had to stand between the men to stop them physically fighting. He obviously wanted to pocket the cash. We dropped our friend and enquired with other airport staff where the main office is for the enforcers. We spoke to two men  at the office who said they were supervisors. They listened to our story and I showed them the video clip. They didn't offer any assistance except to say we should come back tomorrow morning to speak to the general manager. Looks like everyone there is probably taking a portion of the money from this operation they have going on. As a Ghanaian, I feel the corruption here (from the top down) is too widespread, preventing our country from improving.",NEGATIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,K Teague,9/21/2018,"Beautiful state of the art equipment but some poor organisation despite lots of friendly staff. Nobody tells you the procedure, join this queue then shuffle along only to be told you should have gone to the luggage weigh-in queue first. Weigh luggage then rejoin back of check in queue. Told to go to security, shuffle along for a bit then someone asks for departure card. Leave security queue, go to desk where you collect and fill departure card then rejoin back of security queue. Suggest check in desk staff give you a departure card so you will know to fill it in before going through security. Takes a while to shuffle through that and go through immigration departure check then security check. All took about one and a half hours. At gate we were divided into groups 1-5. Not enough seats for group 5 although most passengers are in this group. Infrastructure is very impressive and no doubt they will eventually streamline procedures. Sign posting would be a good start. Shopping and dining facilities are mostly not yet open so I cannot comment on this aspect yet. So, first taste of new terminal: not half bad. Clean, spacious, excellent kit, friendly staff but poor procedures.",NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,13 reviewsAlain Kupferman,1/30/2017,"Old airport, but reconstruction going on. Very efficient immigration on the way in, with separate lane for business class. Fast delivery of luggage as well, took me less than 15 minutes to be out of the airport. Departure wise a little bit slower, but acceptable, friendly immigration and security people, very basic business lounge. Departure procedure efficient, despite lack of discipline of Chinese passengers, always trying to jump queues.",POSITIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,Klaus Malling Olsen,3/7/2016,"During rush-hours (evening) Kotoka Airport felt very crowded, but check-in was surprising quick, as well as security check, this works well if you arrive at least 3 hours before departure. Rush hours here mean departure within half an hour for several wide-body plans, creating a severe lack of seating and extremely long rows of slowly boarding passengers, making you realize that you are in a far too small airport to handle several aircrafts with a capacity of 3-400 passengers within a short time limit. Thi is especially the case when you arrive. The rows of arriving passengers at the immigration was long enough to last for almost one hour, and was followed by usual slow deliverance of luggage. Furthermore, the staff controlling the yellow cards for vaccinations are not very well inset in the rules, including the knowledge that persons over a certain age are not required vaccination against yellow fever. However, as a whole Kotoka was not too bad an experience, just accept some more time than required in more updated and modern airports.",NEUTRAL
Accra Kotoka,airport,Hans Gross,12/23/2013,This time it took 2 hours instead of the usual half hour for landing and immigration. The huge delay was caused first by a 'parking problem' for the aircraft second by the malfunction of 2 of the 3 luggage conveyor belts. For the return embarkation Emirates with its 300-seater had set the check-in period to from 12.30 am (instead of the usual 3.30 pm) until 5.30 pm which did not prevent a delay again of 1 hour for the take-off at 8 pm. The main annoyances of this airport have persisted over the last 10 years: Passengers may enter soaked with sweat and cannot have a shower (I go to the Landing restaurant and try to wipe myself in the toilet room). The sweating continues in the departure hall which is only half air-conditioned. Announcements can barely be understood as there is a cacophony stemming from the sound of TV's and the voices of passengers. It also remains amusing to count the number of passenger controls and checks: there are 4 by the airline and about 6 by other airport staff.,NEGATIVE
Accra Kotoka,airport,D Tan,3/25/2013,"Lack of air-conditioning facilities. Officers going through your bag after check in to ""ensure"" nothing illegal definitely made my luggage messy after hours of arranging and packing at my hotel. Asking passengers of certain zone to board first which all have to board the first bus and other subsequent zone will board the 2nd bus. In the end both buses arrived at the plane at the same time making it crowded. If that is the case what is the point of asking passengers of certain zone to board first? Totally disappointed with the staff/officers in the airport.",NEGATIVE
Adana,airport,K Louris,8/18/2017,Domestic airport small and chaotic as delays are often. All announcements in domestic airport are made in Turkish only. No bar in departures area. No bank for exchange in arrivals. Many car rental companies. No sign for special rental car parking area. When returning a rented car you risk entering the normal parking (which is meters before but separate from the rental car parking area) and you will be asked to pay even if you make a U-turn to leave the parking immediately! Car rental companies are aware of the problem but insist they can do nothing about it.,NEGATIVE
Adana,airport,William Foran,10/4/2007,Adana is in the southern part of Turkey and so the grounds of the airport are full of palm trees and other desert flora. It is chaotic as the previous reviewer has commented. What was amazing to see was aircraft taxiing in on the same part of the tarmac as passengers walking in from their recently landed flights. I recommend the restaurant on the second level. The food was terrific ( it is frequently so in Turkey) and the view (Including the aforementioned strange combination of people and aircraft) was very entertaining. Most of the flights are domestic/commuter flights and therefore the airport is otherwise very quiet apart from the morning and evening rush hours. Yes one could get a whiff of tobacco smoke or strange odors in the terminal but this is the middle east. One should take these differences between our world and theirs in stride.,POSITIVE
Adana,airport,Robert Clark,5/17/2006,"Adana Airport is a chaotic airport at best yet not as bad as airports in other countries that surround it. There are two terminals to the Adana Airport Domestic and International. In most cases the International side is only for the pilgrimage flights to Makkah Saudi Arabia and some limited flights into Northern Cyprus. The Domestic side starts with citizens wanting to take your bags up to the security screening (right at the entrance to the terminal). They will expect a tip for this very small action. Tell them ""hayir saa olun"" and you'll be left alone. You'll put your bags onto the belt and your passport will be checked. Even if you are flying domestically have your passport on you at all times. They will check the validity of your visa and if you have over-extended your welcome. Once you are through (P.S. Security does not speak English so bring some phrases with you) you will have to go to the airline of your choice. Even if you have no luggage and paper tickets you will still have to check in. Organized chaos is the best way I can put it. Regardless if you are flying Turkish Pegasus or Onur Air you will still have people cutting in line using Hefty bags as luggage and uncomfortable closeness. When you finally get to the front the people at the ticket counter normally speak english. MAKE SURE you ask if your bags get taken all the way. Some times they do - sometimes they don't. You may have to pick them back up in Istanbul so its important they make it clear. Once you are done you are left in a terminal that reeks of a foul Turkish soguk gone bad sick passengers that don't cover their mouths when they cough passengers that make that disgusting ""spit like a man"" sound and the ever famous stare. There is a smoking section but it is not seperate from any other room so non-smokers will be subjected to 2nd hand smoke. There is a small store that sells refreshments but does not open until 6am while some flights are much earlier. You'll be hard pressed for a seat so get to the airport early or get used to standing. Keep an eye on your things at all times. Lots of people look suspicious. The loudspeaker is hard to understand in this dimly lighted building and its usually only in Turkish. Just line up whenever everyone else does and try to sneak a peak at their ticket to see if it is your flight. You will go through a second security and enter the gate area. Once again - organized chaos. There is no ""area calling"" and to ""rows 1-10."" Its a massive cattle heard. Just try to get in the front. Once your identity and ticket are checked you will walk out onto the tarmac where you will see a bunch of suitcases (and Hefty bags) This is where is can get confusing. Before you can board the place you must claim your suitcase yet again and give it to the baggage handlers. I guess this is good since you do ensure it gets on the plane but if its a large flight it can be difficult in the dark to find your items. DEPARTURE INTERNATIONAL: Should you get lucky enough and go through immigration in Adana it is much easier than Istanbul. The Duty Free section is very tiny and only has alcohol and cigarettes but the customs queues are tiny in comparison to Istanbul. This may happen to you even if you are going through Istanbul to an international flight so it is always best to check over at International first to see if you leave from there or domestic. For your sake I hope you leave Internationally. ARRIVAL: Landings are pretty simple. If you go through customs (there will only be like 10 of you) you will go through a small customs kiosk your passport will be scrutinized and you'll get to have a rare ""Adana"" stamp in your passport unlike most who travel to Turkey with the ""Istanbul"" stamp. Your bags will come on a low riding baggage claim separate from the domestic fliers and quick out the door. If you are flying in domestically (or after checking into customs in Istanbul) you will have to wait quite a long time before the bags finally arrive onto the low riding baggage claim. In here is where you can rent a car as well about 4 companies are available on site and for those going to the NATO base there is a Hertz located in the Burger King. Back to the airpoort when you get outside you can be picked up by your people (they will not be allowed into the airport) or you can hire a taxi. A gentleman usually brings the taxi to you and loads your bags he will expect a tip. 2 YTL is good enough. P.S. - A good taxi (spelled taksi in Turkish) to go with would be Gate Taxi at +90(322)316TAXI - they speak English. It will cost more but the drivers have better English than the airport taxis) In the airport just dial 322316TAXI. One more thing before I forget - turn around whern you enter the terminal - you'll see the lost luggage department. If you fly here to Adana more than once - expect to go in here a few times. The airport itself is a dirty mess...it smells the facilities are usually dirty it reeks of smoke and it gets pretty loud.",NEGATIVE

Addis Ababa,airport,C London,6/11/2024,"I was pretty frustrated by the experience, mainly due to unhelpful staff. I arrived at 5:00 a.m. and in every waiting area there were staff sleeping. They were all under blankets, and it seems the airport should provide them appropriate rest areas instead of using areas passengers are supposed to use.  After disembarking my first flight, we went through full security with x-rays and no liquids above 100ml. When my flight was announced a few hours later, I then had to go through another security checkpoint just before the flight. No one had warned us of this second repeated security so many people had to throw away the drinks bought the flight at airport prices.  A lot of charging points are broken. Trying to raise issues with staff is met with apathy and disinterest.",NEGATIVE
Addis Ababa,airport,Simon Castleman,4/9/2024,"ADD Bole airport is a zoo. On our outbound flight we arrived from London and passed through security and from there to the lounge and boarded the plane to VFA. On the way back having been through security at VFA and again during transit at ADD we had to go through security again near the gate. Not only that we then had a secondary screening and two lots of document checks. With three flights leaving within 30 minutes of each other having one person looking at documents of 700+ people is just bonkers. I can see why people miss flights at this airport if you're not aware of this. If you are leaving from gates A14-16 inclusive, which seems to be the only part of the airport where this happens, you need to leave a good 20-30 minutes in addition to whatever time you think you need to get to the actual gate.",NEGATIVE

Addis Ababa,airport,Ralph Elsaesser,3/12/2024,"While flying with Ethiopian Airlines is rather reliable and straight-forward (in mostly a little bit outdated machines), the Airport is difficult. Checking in is a joke, people do not queue up, no-one guides you, and after the first security check you're covered in dust and dirt. If you then reach the departure hall, it looks not too bad (unless your gate is downstairs) but if you decide to take a drink, your name should be Elon Musk or so. I just observed that a young father was charged 20 Dollars for heating up his baby's milk. You have to pay 10 dollars for 0.4 liters of beer and the food is a nightmare (I must know it because in May 2023 I was not allowed to enter the country and stayed 36 hours at the airport). To summarize, you are treated as cattle but you pay as a king.",NEGATIVE
Addis Ababa,airport,Gulnar Manji,1/6/2024,"This is one of the most chaotic airports I’ve ever had the experience of being in. We were a family with a child in transit to Dar Es Salaam. On departure to Dar there were several gates and hundreds of people lined up in a corridor of 6-8 feet while other passengers waking up and down the same aisle pushing and shoving as there wasn’t room. Transfer buses were so unorganized with no one giving clear directions and people were pushing and shoving to get to the bus. On our return to Toronto, the security checks were so crowded, it was a shamble, and trays for shoes, purses took forever to come, and when a few trays came everyone tried to grab them creating such chaos. We had to go through security twice and body search!. On our way to gate A16 we had to go through the body scanner. My son was holding his three year old child and the security staff attempted to grab the child so only the father would be scanned. My son put his child down and told the security staff not to touch him yet the staff tried to grab the child and seeing a stranger the child of course started crying. When I told the female staff I would report them she rudely said to me go ahead and refused to give me her name and turned her badge around so I could not see the name. Just going through this airport was not only stressful but frustrating.",NEGATIVE
Addis Ababa,airport,M Collie,11/4/2023,"Transit in the early morning. Lucky to have airbridges for arrival and departure. Distances between gates can be massive. Airport is very busy, but less chaotic than it appears at first sight. The biz security line made the experience less stressful.",NEUTRAL
Addis Ababa,airport,H Smart,9/29/2023,"What a shambles this airport was for our very recent transits. The bus transfer from the incoming flight took forever and by the time we got to security the approximately ten wide column of people had to go down to one to go though security. When we got to the security screening there were no boxes to put liquids, laptops etc. into, and when someone eventually appeared with a stack of them it was a free for all as there wasn't enough to go round. Having survived security we had four hours before our connection to Dar Es Salaam. There were nowhere near enough seats and no air conditioning despite how warm it was. When the gate information came up, (C6 I think it was), we went to our departure gate to find there were two flights going from the same gate before ours, so there were hundreds of people waiting at our gate along with hundreds of others waiting for several other gates all in the same row. The electronic departure board stopped working, no staff to ask for information and another slow bus transfer out to the plane. The return experience was not much better although slightly better organised at security screening. Still not enough seats and still very hot in the main areas. When we went to our gate we had to wait to be admitted to gates A14 - 16 as again there were two flights leaving that area before ours. Seats were very difficult to get and when we finally went through to A15 we had to go through another security screening with shoes and belts off, again. When boarding started it was a free for all until a man appeared and stopped anyone who wasn't in zone 2, but as no announcement was made no-one knew it was boarding by zone number. He disappeared and a lady then appeared and held up three fingers which we assumed, correctly I'm pleased to say, that zone three could board, but again, no announcement. The one good point was no bus transfer. We hope we never have to transit through Bole again.",NEGATIVE

Definitely could not deal with the amount of passengers coming into the customs and baggage area. Rude customs officers who looked so aggresive you dare not look at them. Some employee walking around with a stick in the baggage area saying queue here but kept changing her mind where she actually wanted people to queue to exit the area. That was quite amusing.

Adelaide,airport,M Morrison,7/5/2022,"Awful airport. Security took ages to go through and airport staff were mostly unfriendly except for one staff member who was pleasant. I travelled from London to Auckland and unfortunately had to transit via Adelaide. I had bought duty free items from London (foundations, face creams, perfume) - all within my NZ allowance and all packaged as bought with the receipt available. When going through security the staff hassled me and said I was not allowed to take the items through and they all needed to go into one clear plastic bag. I already had my travel toiletries in one clear plastic bag. The response was tough, you must choose what you want to take with or leave behind. I was definitely not leaving behind $250 worth of cosmetics! Everyone who witnessed this was appalled and agreed this was a ridiculous rule since the items were bought from duty free. I had no issue at Doha airport with the items. Fortunately I had fellow travelers (strangers) on the same flight who were able to take the goods through for me. Had this not been the case they would have forced me to leave items behind. I am very upset by this incident. This was extremely distressing after 30 hours of travel. I would not recommend Adelaide for transfer if this is how they treat international travelers.",NEGATIVE

My baby walked through and off into a mass of people and I was stopped for gaining control over my child with threats and overbearing body language.

Adelaide,airport,N Schuler,10/21/2019,"I have been a frequent flyer for many years with an average flight count of around 85 flights per year for the last 14 years, nationally and international. I used to be happy coming back to Adelaide but the last 2 years arrival at Adelaide to be a horrendous experience. The level of incompetence in getting people through was simply unbelievable. To put you in the picture, this experience I am going to describe happend almost the same on my last 3 international flights, all this year. So, my plane arrived first, a standard A380, followed 25 minutes later by another small international flight. Getting of the plane - quick, getting through passport control - quick and that is where the good part finishes. The luggage took 48 minutes to arrive, on 1 luggage carousel. By the time my bag arrived the queue was returning 3 times around the carousel, you could not even get to the end. Only one office checked the arrival card of every one, talked and saw the growing line building up. She send at least 60% through a line to be checked, and after another 15 minutes in the queue she did that to me too, even though I am APEC member. Another 12 minutes wait before the Officer could attend to me, x-rayed my bag and send me through. I was not allowed to inform my waiting driver (no phones or texting allowed) and he left by the time I came out over an hour later, so I had to join the Taxi queue. I have been to many bad managed airports, Rome, Dhaka, Athens, etc., but Adelaide is the undisputed champion for the worst international arrival service I have experienced. Better arrive from your international leg in Melbourne and take a domestic flight to Adelaide, you will be faster.",NEGATIVE
Adelaide,airport,M Graham,6/17/2019,I can safely say as a regular international traveller by far the worst international airport I've landed at is Adelaide. It has one carousel and even under moderate pressure the baggage wait is horrendous. In my case about 3 planes had landed and it took about an hour and a half to just get my bag. In total over 2 hours to finally get out the door. This place is a sad joke and if possible international travellers should avoid it at all costs and land at a decent Australian international airport.,NEGATIVE
Adelaide,airport,L Borrill,1/11/2019,"I have never reviewed a place before. But I have never been so let down by a service before either. We arrived and had a rocky landing. No big deal. Went to the bathroom straight after landing and then went to walk out the front. We walked through the electric door that took us to the rest of the airport and my little sister realised she had left her phone in the bathroom. We turned around and the doors had just shut behind us and we couldn’t get back in. We asked she security guy if she could run to the bathroom and he said no. Once you walk past the line you can’t come back. We asked how we could get in and he simply pointed in a direction and ignored us. Everything was closed, it was 11pm. We tried to ask him again how we could get back in and he still flat out ignored us. Another staff member walked past and said dont stand near the door. When we asked him where we could go him simply talked over us and said don’t negotiate. You can’t go in. Go away from the line. My little sister was in tears and she had saved and worked so hard to get her new phone. We called out the passengers coming through and asked them go check the toilets for us. We were so lucky that the passengers coming through were helpful because the staff would not even tell us how we could retrieve it. We weren’t trying to argue, weren’t drunk or loud. We simply wanted help. I understand their security reasons and wanting to keep the place safe. But the rudeness and lack of helpfulness from several staff member was disgusting. Worst help.

The border staff looked like they had been asleep for five hours and were surprised by our arrival.

Agadir,airport,Paul Styles,2/16/2009,To get in from the street you must undergo luggage scan first as there's no entry hall. To get out onto the tarmac and into your plane note well that there's no queue space (the departure lounge seats are right by the exit gate doors). Our flight was announced at gate N°6 (there are only 6 gates) but after 5 minutes delay moved to gate 4 then to gate 2 for 150 people with much luggage for a flight with first come first served seats. The hostesses tried to get people to form 2 queue lines in vain so embarkation was a free for all. Shocking treatment for an international airport. Aside from that the setting is very pleasant.,NEUTRAL
Agadir,airport,Kevin Maslin,8/11/2008,No major problems here. Lots of check-in desks open at inbound passport control so we were processed fairly quickly and directed to the transfer coach within 20 mins. Lots of 'porters' in brown uniform with trolleys offered to take our luggage when we disembarked from the coach on the return journey. We could manage ok but I think they were asking for 10 Dirham (about 70p) to take you all the way to check-in which I considered to be fairly reasonable. We were told that we could not spend our left over Dirhams in the departure lounge so we changed them at the bank (not for sterling but to euros!) in the lobby prior to joining the queue for the scanning machine. As there was only one channel in operation it took quite a while to get through and then we discovered that the shops would accept sterling euros or dirhams! Ho-hum. We had taken our own drinks through as we had been told the airport prices were shockingly expensive (even the so-called duty-free!) but we did buy 3 Snickers bars at 4.5 euros! We were not aware that our flight was overdue by half an hour as announcements were largely in French fairly inaudible and the screens were not very informative. Once the gate was open though we were ushered through to the plane quite quickly.,NEUTRAL
Agadir Al Massira,airport,J Davidson,3/28/2018,The security checks at this airport in Agadir is over the top. Luggage checked twice and passport control 4 times. Don't they trust each other? One customs officer has to check the work of the other customs officer? And rows and rows of people trying to find the quickest lanes. Completely inefficient process. It took 2 hours to get through to the gate. I have traveled extensively and even India (in lots of chaotic situations) has a much better organisation. I can understand that security is important but this is absurd and a waste of my time.,NEGATIVE
Agadir Al Massira,airport,Dawn Mohammad,6/30/2017,Awful. Nearly 2 hours to get out of Agadir Airport on arriving. Departure took 3 hours. Never have I been to such a disorganized airport. Security had no queue system on arrival or departure. My transport to my hotel waited 2 hours and cost a small fortune because of the wait. I actually needed more than 4 hours on departure. Never again. I usually fly to Marrakesh and travel to Agadir but this time I could not find a bus to connect with the flight so I flew direct. Big mistake - rude staff not helpful at all. Only good thing is the smoking area inside airport. A horrible experience.,NEGATIVE
Agadir Al Massira,airport,Alan Edwards,3/13/2006,As far as looks go this is good. The rest is average and below arriving luggage arrived reasonable quickly then immigration long wait then the form given on flight thoroughly checked. Departure no Morrocan currency allowed flight side payment in about anything accepted and change given in same staff efficient under the circumstances prices high. Information on flight delays non existant room just sufficient for passengers on 757 charter flight Regarding passport/immigration control on departure. If you have a rollerball pen visible be prepared for the officer wanting to swap pens! Despite these negative comments you do feel the staff are trying.,NEGATIVE
Aguadilla,airport,K Wissler,9/18/2023,"Love this Airport. Small convenient in and out. Dealing with rental cars is quick as most are very close. It food, snacks and a bar. The only downer I would say is sometimes it’s very cold inside waiting area, most likely to keep people awake during the red eye flights.",POSITIVE
Aguascalientes,airport,D Giles,12/27/2020,"This is a small international airport. The personnel are polite, helpful, and efficient.

Aguascalientes,airport,2 reviewsHoward Atkins,10/20/2016,This is a small airport but over the past couple of years it has improved a lot. The customs and immigration are polite and fast with the baggage also coming fast. There is a coffee shop outside the secure area and also one inside but the coffee outside is better. There is also now free WiFi in the airport. There is a lounge but this is not connected to the airlines but for payment. No need to arrive to early,POSITIVE
Ahmedabad,airport,D Mantya,7/12/2024,"I used this airport for travelling on 11 Jul. The Internet did not connect for me as I don't have a local number - no Adani staff was around from security to any of the departure gates to ask the code. There is a land phone which was not working, sad to see in this condition.  immigration officers were laxed, 1 was on his mobile looking reels, 4 passengers were waiting, and he took off and went away without letting know. Security staff at screening were rude to elderly travelers who spoke Gujarati, this is Gujarat and not everyone needs to know Gujarati, but if some elders who can't speak in Hindi shouldn't be scolded or looked down on to speak Hindi. Every local country/region speaks their own language. If they are here to work from other states, they should be at least polite.",NEGATIVE
Ahmedabad,airport,1 reviewsM Hurvil,6/20/2024,"I've been to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport a few times and each time my experience hasn't been good. When I go on family trips, the wheelchair facility is terrible. They board people with wheelchairs last, which hasn't happened at any other airports I've been to. The second issue is that there is no crowd management, everyone just boards the plane at once which leads to shoving and pushing people. However, even with all these people, the airport lacks chairs and seats at the gates. Every time I've traveled from AMD, all my gates had only 15-20 seats which is clearly not enough considering how busy the airport is. The worst part of this airport is the staff, they do not understand requests and are not sympathetic at all. The positives of this airport are the food options is good and has a variety of meals. The other positive thing about the airport is the cleanness.",NEGATIVE

Ajaccio,airport,Martin Kendall,8/9/2021,"In full global pandemic, Ajaccio airport boarding zone was over crowded with passengers on the top of each other, waiting for their flight to board but several were delayed (as ours) by at least an hour! Did anyone attempt to manage the crowd and stop the check ins so the number of persons piling up in a small hall, breathing over each other despite wearing the mask was made? No! Even the police could see how unsafe the situation was but did not intervene. The hall was hot, making breezing with masks difficult, very little chairs available, and a couple of duty free shop with the most rude staff with zero sympathy! Ajaccio airport is a very small airport that can not cope with high number of tourists during summer. Very disappointing. I truly hope everyone was safe and no one was infected by COVID-19 while waiting in such overfilled facilities.",NEGATIVE
Ajaccio,airport,S Simpson,5/30/2019,"Security staff are extremely rude. They made a huge scene about my trekking poles and then confiscated them. I flew from New York City to Paris and Paris to Calvi with my poles and had no trouble in any other airports during my travels. Very disappointed with my Ajaccio airport experience. Moreover, Corsica is a huge trekking destination for hikers so not sure how the incompetent security staff are unaware.",NEGATIVE
Ajaccio,airport,Nick Strohecker,5/29/2019,"Although the airport itself is fine, the security agents are rude, inconsistent, and not bright. Trekking poles were deemed weapons, thus not allowed on the flight, but only some. Other poles, of the exact same type, size, everything, were confiscated by guards that seemed to enjoy their limited power to taint one's vacation. If one needs to bring poles or anything similar through security, I recommend faking a limp or hope that the main jerks are on a lunch break.",NEGATIVE
Ajaccio,airport,P Paquet,1/7/2017,"Site of the airport is unique, but it is the only great thing about it. This airport is unfit for modern travelling while not even maxed out in terms of capacity. Parking lot is expensive and frequently full. Roofs and walls start rusting already. Air conditioning is minimal. Bathrooms are just above the level of average in terms of cleanliness. Luggage handling ground staff has managed via unions to apply a 5 Euros fee per kg to any luggage above 23kg, which make it very uneasy when you fly business class after you've left Corsica with an allowance of 30+kg. This is very annoying because this fee is collected by the airline at check-in and not mentioned in your fare rules when you buy a ticket. Controls are done in a corridor between 2 walls. There are no boarding bridges. No buses. Boarding gates are few and room is tight during the busy summer season. Boarding gates are a few hundred meters away from your aircraft, which makes it very unpleasant to walk from the gate to the plane under the rain. Same issue at arrival if it is raining to reach the airport. 3 luggage reclaim belts, which are very tight during the busy summer season.",NEGATIVE
Ajaccio,airport,O Beyr,10/20/2008,Nice little airport right next to the sea and beaches. There is not much you can expect during waiting time it is only a regional airport. Only point of criticism: access to security control. At the time I was there queues formed randomly without any guidance between around and between counters which led to some confusion and aggression as some people got away without waiting.,NEUTRAL
Ajaccio,airport,Alistair Peckham,8/3/2008,Good efficient airport but suffers from heavy summer traffic and due to the size of the airport there can be delays just due to the amount of flights which the airport can not handle. Also not the best allocation of seats. Security staff were very pleasant and polite. Also not many cues or waits for security or boarding.,NEUTRAL
Akita,airport,Diogo Leite,7/9/2015,"Very small airport. Domestic part is small but has everything we need, of course only one or two varieties in each aspect.

Difficult to access, only taxi or bus from Akita City.",NEUTRAL
Akron–Canton,airport,Sandra Dragomir,1/26/2024,"If you have an early flight, do not expect to be able to get coffee. There is a coffee shop, but it is never open. You can get coffee at 6 AM at every other airport. Why not here?",NEGATIVE
Akron–Canton,airport,2 reviewsJoseph Leonetti,1/1/2022,"Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",POSITIVE
Akron–Canton,airport,M Anderson,5/6/2017,"Easy to get around. It was the perfect size for someone on foot. The staff seemed like a small town community. Everyone seemed to be in effective communication with each other. Traveler satisfaction was clearly a priority for the staff at Akron Canton airport. I felt a good, positive energy there. I liked the choices of food and beer that were available throughout the gates. I liked how well my emotional support dog was greeted and welcomed into the airport and on all three flights I took home. I will fly to and from this airport in the future.",POSITIVE
Al Ain,airport,Premraj Cheekoth,9/29/2017,"Quite a small airport compared to the Dubai or Abu Dhabi International Airports. Only half a dozen or airlines serve this airport. On arrival, myself and wife - senior citizens, were treated with compassion and helped by the airport customs and immigration staff. No difficulties faced by us, we found the airport quite peaceful, neat and tidy. I wish more flights were available to and from this Airport in UAE. Travel to city center of Al Ain, a charming city in the midst of the Arabian desert, was also a pleasant experience with hardly any traffic problems.",POSITIVE
Al Ain,airport,Brian Murphy,3/3/2007,Very small airport but a short and very cheap taxi ride from the town centre. Very convenient if one can get a connecting flight from here. A great alternative if you want to land in somewhere quiet and peaceful to the awful Abu-Dhabi airport which is dismal.,POSITIVE
Al Ula,airport,Vesa Laeaekkoe,9/7/2022,"Al Ula is one of the top tourist destinations in Saudi Arabia and this new airport serves that area. Currently they have only a few flights per day to other Saudi cities and to Dubai so terminal is quite small, it has only 2 departure gates, few shops and cafes, car rental and a tourist desk. Very stylish building actually and everything is done fast since there are not many passengers around, with exception of renting a car. There is no commuter traffic and very few taxis, so renting a car is quite mandatory. It took an hour to get my car because of the queue and bureaucracy. Nevertheless experience was good and this region is very beautiful with lots of history.",NEUTRAL
Albany,airport,S Dan,4/12/2024,"Super easy to navigate this tiny welcoming airport, parking garage fees are reasonable, car rental is close by, drop off and pickup is efficient, airport management does actually care, facilities are clean, food is sparse but there and it is secure. Top notch tiny regional airport!",POSITIVE
Albany,airport,Andrew Champagne,5/16/2012,I fly into and out of Albany a few times a year on business. For my money it's one of the most efficient airports in terms of security/TSA in the country. They get you in out and on your way with very little hassle the way it should be. The airport itself isn't huge and doesn't have some of the amenities of a larger hub but as a traveller I'm looking for efficiency and that's what Albany Airport provides.,POSITIVE
Albany,airport,R Lipera,3/21/2011,"This is my home airport so I fly in and out regularly. Recent renovations to the central area make it even nicer. Fully carpeted soothing music big windows everywhere. There is an observation deck open to the public on the ""non-security"" side that has good views. This is an easy airport in which to get around.",POSITIVE
Albany,airport,I Abodunrin,8/9/2009,It's a relatively small airport. I agree with the earlier post about it's speediness.

Albany,airport,Marc Schwartz,5/16/2005,"I used to live in Albany and have used this airport many times. Albany is a really nice regional airport. It is very close to the Interstate. The standard parking is extremely convenient (across an indoor footbridge; no shuttles). The airport is physically very appealing and flow through check-in to the gates is generally smooth. Same on the return (also note that rental car stuff seems to be a convenient arrangement as well). ALB is as close to ""get there at the last minute and be OK"" as any these days. B terminal is the nicest. Of course this is a regional airport without many of the amenities of a large one. The coffee shop and bar/restaurant are better than most though. I now live in LA and have a much greater hassle. Burbank airport seems similar in size to Albany but Albany is much much nicer.",POSITIVE
Albuquerque,airport,D Heere,6/15/2024,This airport offers zero amenities to the traveler. Probably the most boring place I have waited for a flight. Old equipment at TSA slows progress in getting screened. Few restaurants and even fewer bars. Zero lounges and almost no place to charge a device. It's definitely a miserable enough place that I would no longer consider a trip to New Mexico if it involves this airport!,NEGATIVE
Albuquerque,airport,J Heares,10/16/2023,Only wall outlets and had to try 3 different ones to find one that worked. It's 2023 and everyone needs to charge their devices. First trip to Albuquerque.

Albuquerque,airport,S Theale,5/7/2022,"I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled security. Initially I was thrilled at the process and not separating people from their luggage like so many others. However, one of my bags got 'flagged' (ended up being for a stack of business cards) and it sat waiting to be checked for over 15 minutes. During that time I asked 4 different people about it and was brushed off with comments like 'They're sending someone over' or 'I'm sure they'll take care of it"" and they just walked off. It almost made me miss my flight and was just completely NOT okay. If they had even spoken to me and treated me like a person that mattered it would have been more palatable, but this negative experience will override any positive about this airport.",NEGATIVE
Albuquerque,airport,39 reviewsW Jackson,4/19/2022,"ABQ is a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements. For starters: If you have TSA Pre-Check here, you're golden. Security is an efficient and friendly process. If you don't have Pre-Check, then the service, at least for a small airport, can be quite non-communicative, abrasive and slow. The pueblo-inspired architecture and interior design of the airport render it one of the most beautiful small airports in the USA, and the post-security viewing area of the runway and mountains is the sort of thing that more airports in this country need. However, it's not always easy to enjoy the design and the views when the tile and carpet flooring and seating throughout the airport are dirty and, for a lack of better words, dilapidated and outdated. Speaking of seating, there really isn't enough of it, in my opinion. The signage directing you to amenities, services and locations throughout the airport is helpful, but also outdated. The dining and shopping options are fine for a small airport, so no real complaints. Some people complain about the rental car facility being separate from the terminal and requiring a shuttle bus, but, honestly, the bus runs frequently and the ride is pretty short. Everything is easily accessible from I-25 and downtown Albuquerque. With a little modernization and polishing, ABQ has the potential be as good as new again.",NEGATIVE

Albuquerque,airport,C Orehek,9/10/2016,This is my favorite airport. There is rarely a line to check in and check baggage or for security. On site airport parking is convenient and reasonably priced.

Albury Airport and Rex Airlines should be ashamed of their procedures. There was absolutely nothing wrong with my confiscated bag and it was definitely not oversized.,NEGATIVE
Albury,airport,W Harding,6/14/2016,Albury is a pleasant airport. The staff are kind and knowledgeable. There are 5 gates - 4 departure and 1 arrival. The lines are short but it is still good to get in early. The seats in the boarding lounges are somewhat comfortable. When it comes to security it's okay. The airlines that you need to go through security for are Qantas and Virgin Australia but not Regional Express. The terminal is clean especially the toilets. The café is overpriced but the food is ok. The only shopping in the terminal is the café. Unlike most airports it is almost impossible to get lost in ABX. The only drawback is that to get to and from the terminal to or from the plane you have to walk across the tarmac. Out of all the airports I have been to ABX has been the best.,POSITIVE
Albury,airport,C Tudehope,4/18/2010,It's a gorgeous little country airport. The terminal only opened last October and it still has a new smell. There are no queues anywhere and in general all ground staff are friendly and laid back. There is no need to allow excess time because there will be no queues at checkin or at security-the largest planes into the airport only seat 78 people-and they aren't always full. There are lovely large windows with views over the tarmac runway and ranges in the distance (and if it's race day you can see the horses too). The cafe is good although a bit overpriced. It's interesting that whilst Virgin and Qantas passengers have to go through security Rex and Brindabella passengers don't. There are no issues to speak of in this small yet very pleasant airport.,POSITIVE
Alderney,airport,J Tydeman,7/20/2013,Flew into Alderney from Southampton. A lovely little airport. Very relaxed; friendly staff and a good shop and cafe (very good considering the airport is tiny).

Alghero Fertilia,airport,Harry Albright,1/27/2006,A nice little airport actually in Fertilia rather than Alghero. It has been recently expanded and a new arrivals hall should be opening shortly. Arrivals are straightforward both Schengen and non-Schengen. There are two belts for luggage and then you are straight out to the arrivals hall. Car rental desks are opposite where you come out and there are a couple of cash machines as well as a bar and a few shops. At the bar you pay at the cash register then take the receipt to the bar. Apart from the car rentals there are taxis just outside arrivals although these are pricey (about 20 Euro to the centre of town). It's about 12km to Alghero. Another option is to turn right and cross the parking lot. About 100 metres away are bus stops with orange buses running to Alghero and other buses heading to Sassari and Cagliari. Buy tickets for the Alghero buses at the souvenir shop (about 70 cents) in the terminal. If this is closed ride the bus anyway. The driver will sometimes stop for you to buy tickets sometimes not. Departures is equally straightforward at the other end of the terminal from arrivals. Note though that there is absolutely nothing to do airside so don't go through too soon. Non-Schengen international flights (e.g. to the UK) all leave from gate 1 and you have to queue for passport checks before you are allowed in to the gate area. The immigration officers usually arrive about 30 minutes before the flight.,POSITIVE

Algiers,airport,1 reviewsT Peters,10/14/2016,Algiers airport transit from Spain to Qatar. Despite the Algeria embassy in Madrid telling us that a transit visa wasn't mandatory I recommend you to take it with you. There isn't an special way for transits. You must cross the passport control to enter Algeria and another passport control to go to your departure gate. It`s a quite slow process(30 min+). Also 3 security scans. The airport is small with a very interesting mix of cultures. The restaurants only accept cash in local currency (there is a bank in the terminal). Airport staff very helpful. Very dirty WC. New terminal under construction.,NEGATIVE
Algiers,airport,9 reviewsAndre Bouzid,10/28/2015,"Arrival from London was fine but the immigration hall was packed and it took a bit of time to get through. Baggage claim is always a nightmare at Houari Boumidienne airport (Algiers) because everyone has so many huge bags and the system isn't very efficient. Connections to the city are ok but we got a taxi. On the way back, check in had a very long line. But since we had online check-in, they allowed to go into Club Europe's queue though the way the agents work so lethargically, it wasn't much quicker. Immigration was smoother than on arrival. Security was separated by gender which annoyed some less conservative Algerians. I have to say we got the timing spot on as we were able to buy some Algerian wine and after a few minutes, we were boarding. But then, there is more security after the boarding gate which slows everything down as the X-ray kept breaking. What I personally don't like about Algiers airport is that there is so much ""security"" when in fact, the officers behind the screen are just chatting and laughing, barely looking at the screen.

Algiers,airport,Qaddoumi Samar,5/16/2013,Algiers airport is huge and clean but I did not enjoy the business class lounge it was extremely poor compared to other countries. I had to go outside the lounge to use the toilet they served very poor quality food. As a Muslim country I also expected to a mosque for prayers but there was no specialized area. Shopping in the airport was ok.,NEGATIVE
Algiers,airport,R Oussalah,10/10/2012,This is the first time in over a year I used this airport and I have to say that I am not disappointed. Its facilities are fair very clean pleasant to stroll through and spacious. The staff is pleasant and professional.,POSITIVE
Algiers,airport,Mohamed Salah,7/27/2011,Good airport international terminal T1 is nice spacious clean. The only problem I see is the fact that the interdiction of smoking is not always respected.,POSITIVE
Algiers,airport,R Oussalah,1/19/2011,"For departures Algiers new airport is fairly spacious functional and the staff is friendly. I might have been lucky but I found the police controls and security to go fairly quickly. Shops are limited but I found them sufficient also they are open very early and close late. The choice of restaurants is limited to 1 for each hall and they are of the same provider. They offer reasonable selections of light eating and drinking. On arrivals I find it inadequate to have to walk down stairs after coming off the plane. I did not see an elevator available. The wait for the luggage is too long. I was told it was due to the luggage scanner being undersized for the traffic. One important deficiency is the absence of English signs; they are all in French and Arabic only. A shame for a brand new ""International"" airport. Over all I was satisfied mainly due to efficiency at departure and the feeling of space which is lacking too often in aging European airports.",POSITIVE
Algiers,airport,Mark Wadham,5/26/2010,The airport building in itself is fairly attractive and spacious. However it is spoilt by 3 things - stench of smoke everywhere. Algeria is 30 years behind when it comes to smoking restrictions. Long waits and bureaucratic procedures. These are the fault of the authorities. Stood in line for 40 minutes to get through immigration. Out of stock duty-free shop. OK if you want to buy Baileys but not much else.,NEUTRAL
Alicante,airport,H Gibbs,11/18/2024,Alicante airport is very clean and tidy. My only complaint is that the acoustics are terrible. Any announcements are impossible to understand and sometimes two announcements are made at the same time which is a waste of time.,NEGATIVE
Alicante,airport,Janet Westgarth,9/9/2024,I was travelling with 2 sight impaired friends. Assistance was prebooked with Easyjet. I cannot praise the staff highly enough.

Alicante,airport,S Maldan,1/7/2024,"Special assistance staff went above and beyond to help us after huge road delays meant we were late arriving at the airport. Can’t thank them enough!! Airport itself was very clean, easy to navigate, lots of choice for food and drink. Fantastic staff.",POSITIVE

When we came to return our rental car it was very difficult to understand were to go, and we went the wrong way twice. And we were not alone. Then, no restaurant except Burger K. before you come to the gates. And they made the entrance to the gates long by forcing everyone to go trough the tax free shopping area.  In the gate area there was very late info of witch gate to go to.",NEGATIVE

Also the girl at the EasyJet gate took my postcards which I had forgotten to post ,and promised to post them for me. They all arrived eventually, so thank you!",POSITIVE
Alicante,airport,Caroline Hubbard,6/24/2022,"With the media coverage of airport delays we arrived early for our flight.

There were just two police officers checking passports for more that 300 people. In the past passing through immigration has not been a problem.,NEGATIVE
Alice Springs,airport,Sandi Adamson,3/1/2024,Nice airport but it's the slowest for unloading passengers and luggage. I'm here frequently and it does my head in how slow it is! Please look into this. Why is it so long for luggage? And why does it take 30 min to get passengers off a plane?,NEGATIVE
Alice Springs,airport,14 reviewsO Martin,3/8/2018,"A small airport in the dead centre of Australia. The airport is a modern concrete building with plenty of glass. Just past the luggage carousel, there were many desks helping tourists to their next stop or journey. As it was internal flight, we walked straight to the luggage carousel. The luggage duly arrived, but not our hosts. We waited in the hot exteriors for our host and we could see the whole airport being shut down. It is a very quiet airport indeed.",POSITIVE
Alice Springs,airport,Alastair Finch,11/12/2014,Beautiful new terminal with excellent check in security and facilities - very impressed.,POSITIVE

Alice Springs,airport,Paul Harvey,9/23/2009,"A typical small Australian airport which operated well. Some distance out of the city it is served by a bus and taxis (fare $30+). Check in was easy there being more than enough desks for the traffic. Security was efficient with a bookshop and cafe airside. All gates are ""walk to the plane"" which are never far away. Compared to many this is a nice airport.",POSITIVE
Almaty,airport,Nick Upton,6/8/2024,An absolute shambles of a place. Far too small for its purpose and extremely disorganised. Signage from domestic arrivals to international departures are not clear and security staff do nothing to stop people pushing and shoving and jumping the queue as you scan your luggage. The tiny check in area is shared with passport control so the lines intermingle with not enough staff. The waiting area is dark too small with nowhere near enough seating so that the whole place is crowded with people standing. Announcements are not clear and insufficient toilets for the crowds that build up. One of the worst airport experiences I've ever had. This is my second visit to Kazakhstan and I'm unlikely to return due to the surly staff and unorganized airport.,NEGATIVE
Almaty,airport,Daniela Ries,8/3/2023,"Completely pure disorganization by arrival. No announcement in English or in very poor quality without a chance to understand. Passport control was very crowded, no coordination via local airport staff, it took about 2.5h to pass the passport control. Very poor organization of luggage. Fast track was not possible",NEGATIVE
Almaty,airport,Herbert Poenisch,4/14/2023,"Business class passengers are whisked away by VIP service only if they pay for this service.

Almaty,airport,T Andersson,9/2/2022,"The business ""lounge"" at this airport is ridiculous. Everything - even water - has to be paid for. The free ""snacks"" are disgusting, cheap, worthless Turkish sweets. You (or airlines) basically pay for access to a bar where you can buy drinks and food. Can't believe this.",NEGATIVE
Almaty,airport,S Baltanek,12/16/2021,"Almaty airport international departure lounge is only one hall, where everyone on all flights is jammed together. Extremely small space. The cafeteria available there are horrible to put it best, there is a Starbucks with very few tables. The cleanliness is substandard. Try not going to the toilets if you can: it is just a psychologically traumatic experience: the smell is horrible, not clean, often no paper towels available, the soap dispensers are just unpleasant to touch. Business class lounge at Almaty Airport is a huge scam, do not go there. It has very small space, poorly ventilated, all airlines crammed into one room, and the scam is that they charge for everything there, including for water, at overpriced rates. The security procedure is ridiculous. The passport control check passport and checks the face matches passport. The security check is roughly 10 meters after passport control, where there is a separate counter with someone checking passport and asking to show face. Now, the funniest part is that right after the counter, literally after taking 3-5 steps, there is another person who asks to show passport and checking the face again. I am not joking, this is seriously being done by people at the airport, literally three separate passport and face checks within 20 meters. Almaty Airport is a disgrace, shame to the country and to beautiful city of Kazakhstan.",NEGATIVE
Almaty,airport,B Adams,4/7/2018,"My first time transiting in Almaty. Kazakhstan, being an resource rich country, I expected that the airport of their largest city to be at least an international airport. I was most disappointed. 1) The business class lounge - guests must pay $26/pax to have snacks. All drinks are chargeable except for hot water, tea and instant coffee. There is no shower and no service. The ladies who work there really could not be bothered to serve anyone except to remind any guests who walk nearby the snack table that the snacks were chargeable. And guests are not allowed to bring drink/food from outside. Air Astana really needs to build their own lounge instead of using one provided by the airport. Being a Emerald frequent flyer under One World, I know I am spoilt at the First Class Lounges around the world. But this lounge in Almaty borderlines to be offensive. 2) Stairs, stairs and more stairs. This airport cannot be used by those who have disability or travel with baby strollers. There are stairs everywhere - first down from the air-bridge to transfer security, then up the stairs again to the gates. There is actually an elevator - but their are locked and guests are not allowed to use it. 3) Limited choices of food - there is only snacks and coffees. Do not plan to have a dinner in this airport while waiting for your flight. 4) Service - Lack of it. The Air Astana team is helpful. But other than them, service is so poor from the security team, to immigration as well as the waiting staff at those food stalls. Overall - avoid this airport if you have a choice.",NEGATIVE
Almaty,airport,Rosemary Papadopoulou,3/30/2018,"Not good for transit passengers. Staff are polite and helpful but nowhere to relax/sleep in a darker and quiet area. No ATMs/shops/food outlets, just a cafe upstairs. Toilets clean. Electric socket near where I was sitting didn't work. I obtained wifi with the help of someone as there seems to be no airport wifi. This lounge is just a square room, brightly lit, with toilets/chairs and a few coffee tables. Please improve our flying experience.",NEGATIVE
Almaty,airport,1 reviewsT Petrov,12/14/2017,"The airport itself is very small. I experienced huge crowds at the entrance of the terminal for the first security check line. The same at the passport control. Waiting area for departure is too small. On the way to the aircraft you have to deal with no escalators and elevators are too small. Terminal announcements on the departing and arriving flights were made permanently, even if I was traveling internationally I was forced to hear information on domestic flights.",NEGATIVE
Almaty,airport,18 reviewsAiyaphol Kemapuckpong,9/2/2016,"Most of the flights use the gates, but even though they are empty many low-cost flights (all except Air Astana, Etihad etc) use the ramps. The staff were reasonably friendly, and the immigration process was no bother compared to Tashkent Airport. The airport itself is too small. One of my friends in Business class decided to not use the lounge because it was just rubbish. The staff don't really care if the people in the business class lounge talk loudly or anything. The airport's check-in could be improved, and the domestic arrivals hall has too many taxi drivers trying to find customers. Food choice is also limited, but the duty free was actually pretty decent. However, I would not use this airport again, but I have to next year.",NEGATIVE
Almaty,airport,4 reviewsHerbert Poenisch,7/31/2016,"Agree with other reports that this airport lacks most of the conveniences which a frequent traveller expects.

Avoid this airport if you can.",NEGATIVE
Almeria,airport,Mike Saunders,10/9/2018,First time to this airport. When we arrived it was such a pleasant surprise to see how small it was. The time from landing to being on the transfer bus was 15 minutes. The cases were already waiting after passport control. On the return visit it was much busier as several flights were taking off in a short period. However they dealt with the people quickly with no issues at all. I wish all airports were like this one,POSITIVE
Almeria,airport,Chris Knight,3/4/2018,"Pleasant small airport. Excellent parking, far far nicer than Alicante and better than Murcia San Xavier. It's in Spain, so some Brits may find things a little slow but nothing is slow enough to annoy any but the really intemperate. We like it and will use it as our Andalusian airport of choice for as long as we can.",POSITIVE
Almeria,airport,Bill Riley,7/25/2017,The airport is clean and modern. We had to walk a couple of hundred metres from the 'plane to the terminal - ok on a dry day. The delay at passport was unacceptable. Two grumpy officers dealing slowly with a couple of hundred arrivals. Not good enough.,NEGATIVE
Almeria,airport,Wayne Hakim,7/19/2017,"Horrible, hot sweaty long wait in passport control. Worst ever airport. Screaming kids and a two hour wait in queue for passport control.

Almeria,airport,Stuart Ward,7/10/2011,Interesting to see the airport since last year. Inbound passport has moved further indoors so no queuing on the road but still slow processing. There's an escalator to passports now which had a log jam at the top when we arrived so some guy had to rush out and switch it off otherwise there would be a pile of passengers at the top! Baggage arrived about 20mins after flight landed. Outbound speedy check in and security. Roof terrace still not open nothing has changed since last October.,NEGATIVE
Almeria,airport,Stuart Ward,10/24/2010,Arrival okay queue to go through passport was a bit long. Luggage arrived on the belt as we got though. Limited baggage handlers so for a full charter flight might be longer. About 25 mins from landing to getting in the taxi. Going out the departure hall has been rebuilt much better and quicker. Security still tight big queue to get through. The departure lounge has been rebuilt and access to the rooftop terrace removed. The lounge is much better than the original. As work is going on don't know if there are plans to restore access to the roof. Small snack bar with coffee and rolls at reasonable prices but duty free for local stuff is the same price as supermarkets and imported stuff is more expensive than UK supermarket prices. Wouldn't want to arrive or depart when there are more than 2 charter/scheduled UK flights though. Then it would get overloaded very quickly.,NEUTRAL
Almeria,airport,Susan Davis,7/18/2007,I found the airport to be more than adequate. We were there in July and it was busy but check in was OK as was security. The waiting area is small and there are not enough catering facilities but the roof top terrace was brilliant it was a pleasure to wait for the plane for once and you can have a cigarette in peace! The toilets were clean and tidy wastebins emptied frequently so all in all not a bad airport - have certainly spent time in much worse,POSITIVE
Almeria,airport,S William,3/25/2007,Almeria was unfortunately not built to handle the amount of traffic using it. There is only one runway which means deays in departure if there are several arrivals. The terminal facilities are sufficient in the low season but when the charters are at full peak it is woefully inadequate. The limited number of check-in desks means that when several flights are being loaded often only one or perhaps two desks are available for each. There is a real bottleneck at the one and only security entrance. Information is poor even when it is obvious that flights are late the original time is left showing on the monitors. The departure lounge is small and with only one cafe which offers a very limited selection of food and drink. There is however a large open roof seating area with lift and stair access with excellent views of the apron and runway with a cafe which opens when the airport is busy. The only bus link is crowded with non-airport passengers as already described by an earlier contributor and doesn't end at the combined bus/rail station but some 400 metres away in town. A taxi to the centre is only 8 - 10 Euros.,NEUTRAL
Almeria,airport,Dan Thorneycroft,8/25/2006,Reading some of the other reports of Almeria airport I have to say that I must have been lucky on the twenty or so times I have used the airport because I have not had any problems to complain about. The only serious problem which needs to be highlighted is the pilfering of baggage which happens. In view of the serious security problems at British airports someone in a foreign airport who can steal items from baggage could just as easily be putting something in! Almeria to Stansted appears to be the main problem and whilst the pilfering could be taking place at Stansted this is unlikely due to the limited amount of time the bags are available to the people doing the pilfering. The bags are out of sight at Almeria for up to 1.5 hours before the flight.,NEUTRAL
Almeria,airport,Mohd Kastor,5/31/2006,A small airport with limited but more than enough facilities. The immigration control area is very small with only one counter; resulted in a long queue extending to the outside of the arrival's entrance door. In the departure hall try to get anything you want (food newspaper souvenir etc.) before passing through security. Once airside there are only one small duty free shop and one very small cafe; boring poorly stocked and expensive!,NEGATIVE
Alor Setar,airport,Farouk Mogheth,2/26/2011,A regional airport for the northern most city in Malaysia just 45min drive from the Thai borders. A fairly sized terminal with Air Asia and Malaysian flying. Clean and very modern indeed with services and several shopping points for food. The process is fairly quick. There are only 2 gates with OK seating. The only downturn is that there is no monitor next to the gates and its not possible to see the plane on the tarmac so when we had a minor delay no one knew how much was the actual flying time and some were nervous. Otherwise very cheap flights to Kuala Lumpur- much better than a 7hrs bus ride for sure and a cheaper option to fly from BKK to southern Thailand just hop through the borders and fly to KL.,POSITIVE
Altenburg,airport,R Heelas,10/13/2008,As with many small airports travelling to and from Altenburg is a pleasure. The terminal is about as big as a Drive-Through burger restaurant and there is free parking within 30m of the building. This airport is an excellent option for passengers travelling to or from the southern part of the former East Germany or to the north of Bavaria (I live in Bamberg and the drive is much shorter and more pleasant than to the next nearest Ryanair airport at Frankfurt Hahn). On the downside if you arrive early the Duty Free shop is very small and the restaurant is basic but the staff are friendly.,POSITIVE
Amarillo,airport,Andrew Levy,1/7/2005,AMA has 2 passenger concourses but nearly all passengers must use the north concourse (serving the 30-series gates) serving American Eagle Continental Express and Southwest. The northwest concourse (serving the 20-series gates) is largely unused. As a result security screening at the north concourse is prone to long back-ups. One thought is for the airport to modify some leases and reassign tenants in order to ensure that the entire terminal is more uniformly utilized which would reduce terminal congestion.,NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,T Hilderbrandt,11/21/2024,"Terribly disorganized airport. Signage is horrible for international transfers. Had to go through security 3 times. E.g., bought some overpriced water by the boarding gate. Then they ordered all passengers out to go through security and then they took my water away. At security, they pulled my bag apart, then just stuffed things in randomly. I had to repack the whole thing. Few staff speak any English and they are rude. Also the airport has zero places to lie down anywhere. Avoid this airport if you can. They are amateurs in this business and a disgrace.",NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,2 reviewsMacit Samarah,8/17/2024,The airport has a nice design but it is not well maintained and you always feel it’s aging fast. The waiting time to reach immigration might take more than an hour in summer while bags might take on average 45 minutes in non-peak times. Duty free is good and the RJ lounge is very good with plenty of options. Toilet and hygiene facilities don’t have consistent standard,NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,Kezia Verena,8/9/2024,"I am writing to express my frustration with a recent security check at your airport. While traveling with my two young children, security staff threw away all the milk I brought for them. They couldn’t explain why and struggled with English, making communication difficult. As a parent, it was distressing to have essential items taken without proper justification. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,Jaime Cousin,3/8/2024,"Awful experience during the security check as a female traveler. My bags went through the scanner and they requested to physically check 2/3 bins. After a rude check of my 2 bins they decided without reason & at the final moment to check my 3rd bin. I had food, which included cheese, they decided that cheese is liquid and refused that I take it. This bin was not flagged by the scanner - and cheese is not liquid. This was an arbitrary nonsensical decision. I’m furious that they are making this calls without any checks and balances. Furthermore I feel like I was discriminated upon as a female solo traveler.",NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,JB Bellamy,2/18/2024,"The airport experience was very unpleasant. The security staff was extremely rude and ripped my souvenir papyrus that we bought from Cairo. Everyone is very inefficient that’s why there are multiple security checkpoints. I guess the uneducated impolite security personnel feel empowered to give tourists a hard time. With this experience, we don’t have the desire to come back to Jordan.",NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,J Natinski,1/1/2024,"It was by far the worst airport experience I've ever had. The airport security personnel were incredibly rude and treated passengers with utter disrespect. They thoroughly searched through all of my belongings, including my medically prescribed medications, without any consideration for privacy or common courtesy. What shocked me the most was the length of time the security check took. Despite there not being a large number of people in line, the process took well over an hour, causing me to almost miss my flight. The airport was unprofessional and dirty. The facilities were poorly maintained, and the overall atmosphere was one of chaos and disorganization. It's clear that the staff are in need of proper training in customer service and basic hygiene practices. I would strongly advise anyone considering traveling through Amman International Airport to find an alternative route. The treatment and conditions at this airport are unacceptable, and I would never subject myself to such mistreatment and unhygienic conditions again.",NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,M Hasheem,9/22/2023,"We flew from Jeddah (excellent) via Amman by RJ Business Class to London Heathrow. When we landed into Amman as business class passengers we were first to leave the aircraft. Upon leaving we were met by an airport staff member that asked where we are going and a queue of people from the previous aircraft waiting to get through security in the 2nd row. I explained i'm transiting to LHR an that I have 2 hours until my next flight leaves i should have been able to walk through the first security queue. He then demands i join the back of the 2nd queue (approx 200 people) while the people from my flight walk through security in the 1st queue. I explained again, i'm going to be late for my flight but was ignored completely! 1 hour later he then merges both queues together to speed things up. So, what was causing the delay? 1 man in security with no magnifying glasses or machinery going through liquids under 100ml looking for specific ingredients! What's worse! By the time we get to this point he's trying to chat up my wife! This is the worst airport i have transited in! Never again! The staff are rude and are not interested in helping/listening. They don't know what customer service is! nor how to operate an airport. There is a lot of learning that need to happen here. I highly recommend you don't transit through Amman if you don't want to lose your sanity.",NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,Uwe Schmitt,7/26/2023,First time in Jordan we had to change the airplane at Amman airport. The experience at the security check was not a good one.

We spent a few hours in the Business-Lounge and enjoyed the food and the comfortable atmosphere.,NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,1 reviewsG Carter,3/16/2023,"We passed through this airport in transit twice, coming and going on a round trip. The airport appears modern, signage is okay. Bathrooms mixed on cleanliness. The worst part is passing though security. The first time through went reasonable well. It wasn't too crowded. But security was inconsistent. My wife had to give up her water bottle, mine made it though (full of water). All laptops had to be swabbed. Why? The second time through was chaos. There were too few staff and scanners. Passengers were cutting in line, there was no crow control or line barriers. It took about 30 minutes to get through. Security staff were, however, very helpful. We had lost an item (a book) on the first pass through, and three weeks later security had the item in the Lost and Found. We had to fill out considerable paperwork, show ID etc. to reclaim the paperback novel. But we did get it back. I would avoid this airport.",NEGATIVE
Amman Queen Alia,airport,C Larson,9/16/2022,The airport looks very futuristic and modern from the outside but the inside is total chaos. It really isn't big enough for the number of passengers wanting to check in. This is made worse by all the Royal Jordanian flights being in one giant queue waiting for a check in desk. Why isn't is possible to check in using the RJ App? Why don't they dedicated queues for each flight? The result was total chaos with a member of staff running up and down calling out the flight destinations to get the passengers out of the queue because the flight was starting to board. Once you get past the check-in and security there is massive of space for shops and restaurants. It seems the airport is more interested in making money than having enough space and desk so passengers can check in easily,NEGATIVE
Amritsar,airport,Madhur Gupta,11/30/2023,"Very pathetic experience, very dull area, poor toilets, poor finishing, damaged trollies, not clean. It feels like we come on the bus stand.

Amritsar,airport,Jaspreet Kaur,7/24/2019,"Such a poor maintenance of airport (The ACs did not work, garbage was lying on floor for at least two hours from what I saw).

Airport seemed so unhygienic overall.",NEGATIVE
Amritsar,airport,Henna Apoorv Jain,2/28/2019,"Airport with such high traffic but the roads inside airport premises are in bad shape. It was a task to drag a wheeler or a trolley. Condition of the trolleys was really bad. There is not appropriate and enough space to sit, like if 2 flights are delayed at a time, passengers were literally playing musical chairs to get comfortable seating. There are no lounge facilities. Maintainence of baby room was very bad. There was no appropriate signage for gate nos. I was travelling with my infant baby and all this made things very inconvenient for me. Wasn't a very pleasant experience. Hope they improve.",NEGATIVE
Amritsar,airport,Julie Shah,1/26/2019,Absolutely barbaric officials! Me and my friend had 2 days in Amritsar visiting the sites and were overwhelmed by the friendliness of the local people. That was until it was time to leave and the overall experience of the airport. Who on earth do these people think they are and how they are allowed to treat people the way they do. They are a disgrace to humanity and need to be brought into check. Not one nice official at this airport.,NEGATIVE
Amritsar,airport,Karan Bedi,11/9/2017,"Very bad welcome due to lack of organised system, in particular long queues at immigration when you have infants. No special privileges and consideration for families with infants. 2 bad experiences in a row. Rude staff. Very poor structural organisation. Won’t be travelling again to or from this airport. It’s a nightmare and a digrace to holy city of Punjab.",NEGATIVE
Amritsar,airport,Jag Jhajj,9/7/2017,"Small but efficient and clean airport. There was not much rush, and check in to gate was 20 minutes in the evening. I fly from this airport once a year and never have any issue.so far. Customs and immigration takes less time than any other airports in India experienced.",POSITIVE
Amritsar,airport,A Anderson,4/28/2017,This is a small and quiet airport. The aerobridges are still not in use which is cumbersome for families travelling with children and disabled people. The buses used to transfer to the terminal are jerky so again elderly and small children need to be careful. The luggage arrived with in 40 minutes except baby pram which was delayed by 2 hours as they treat it as a luggage. It was really stressful for us as we were waiting for a good 2 hours for our pram after a 14 hour flight and on the top of it they asked for money / bribe as they had to carry it from airside as it can damage the luggage belt. The immigration is bit slow at this airport and make sure that they have stamped the correct arrival year on your passport as some passengers passports were stamped for 2016. They may harass you for their own deliberate mistakes at the time of departure because stays exceeding 180 days as per Indian Immigration rules have to get the exit stamp from local police station or FRO. The departure waiting area is small but again matches the capacity of airport as long as there are no delays.,NEGATIVE
Amritsar,airport,Sunny Singh,3/28/2016,I fly every year to Amritsar from London but to my disappointment the aerobridge gate has not been used for 3-4 years. They use old noisy buses which are not low floor as per international standards to transport passengers to the aircraft. They don't have any nappy changing area for children - many areas could improve.,NEGATIVE
Amritsar,airport,1 reviewsAndrew Lawes,3/21/2016,"Airport is clean and small. There is however no board with digital information providing updates on flight schedules in and out of the airport. Once in the departure lounge area we sat for hours as our flight was delayed. We received no information and there was no electronic information board to provide us with updates. No verbal announcements either. We just sat. When we questioned airport staff, they had no more information than we did. This is not how a modern airport should run. In addition to this, there should be more affordable refreshments on sale as the airline (Turkmenistan Air) wasn't going to give us any. There should also be free WiFi for us to use our mobile phones. Other than that it was an OK airport. More cheap and drinks would help.",NEGATIVE

Amsterdam Schiphol,airport,N Belanez,3/3/2025,"Amsterdam Schiphol Airport is usually efficient, but the baggage claim experience was frustrating. Waiting for luggage always takes some time, but an hour is simply unacceptable. To make matters worse, they made us change belts twice without clear communication, adding to the confusion and frustration. After a long flight, the last thing passengers want is to be stuck at the carousel with no updates or assistance. Schiphol is a major international airport, so one would expect better organization and faster service in handling luggage. While the rest of the airport functions well, this delay significantly impacted the overall experience. Improvements in baggage handling efficiency and communication would make a big difference for travelers.",NEGATIVE

A leading European economy shouldn’t have this kind of chaos",NEGATIVE

I stayed at the Citizen M Hotel the night before, so I was checking in at 06.45. I got to my gate, in agony, at 08.25. Atrocious Airport experience.

Amsterdam Schiphol,airport,Kouros Garno,1/4/2025,"In my experience Schiphol is hands-down one of the worst airports; consistently, year after year. I suggest to those who manage the airport to pay a visit to Singapore, Doha, Abu Dhabi, Athens, Madrid in order to educate themselves about how great airports are being run. In Schiphol it has become normal for passengers to have to wait for over an hour to collect their luggage, luggage is often damaged by the handlers in that airport, security screening is horrendous, the toilets are dirty, the staff are obnoxious and rude. Long time ago it used to be a nice experience to travel through Schiphol, for quite some time not any more.",NEGATIVE

Renting a car was a bit of a pain because it was in another building, a long way to drag several bags. When departing, we arrived 2 hours early but had to wait about 45 minutes before checking our bags. There were only 2 people working, one for frequent flyers and one for the rest of us. The couple at the head of our line had a problem and it took 45 minutes for the lady to get the problem worked out! When we got in line, there were 6 people in line.

I was really hungry after a long 5 hour flight from LAX, so the first thing I did was grab something to eat from Cinnabon (one of many restaurants at this airport). Baggage claim experience was smooth. Taxi was readily available outside for transportation to hotel. While returning back, I had a very smooth check-in and security experience. If you enjoy watching beautiful scenery and planes, Anchorage will not disappoint. As you walk around the terminal, you will notice many ""photo opportunities"" both inside and outside the terminal.",POSITIVE

Anchorage,airport,Frank W Mauz,7/23/2015,"Ted Stevens Anchorage Airport South (domestic) Terminal is a pleasure to navigate through. Modern, uncrowded, spacious, scenic with many wonderful Alaskan artifacts. Seems that almost everyone photographs the giant stuffed moose upon arrival. A nice variety of stores-even a McDonalds with a 50 cent ice cream cone. Comfortable and roomy observation deck. Short walk to be connected to People Mover (city bus), Alaska Railroad and rental cars (no need to ride shuttle bus). The most complete and careful security check I have experienced.",POSITIVE
Anchorage,airport,Daniel Re,9/6/2014,The (south) domestic terminal in Anchorage is world class and beautiful. This new terminal is very modern spotlessly clean provides amenities expected at an international airport and offers a view of the surrounding mountains that is breathless. The displays of local wildlife native culture and art is unsurpassed by most airports in the world. However the old north terminal (which is now connected to the south terminal by a concourse) is sad. Anchorage is one of the five most busy airports in the world for international (cargo) airlines but not for international passenger service. The few international airlines that do provide passenger service (mostly during the summer months) are forced to use the north terminal as U.S. customs is located there. All the comments seen on this site are about the north terminal made by international travelers and are undoubtedly true. Wish they all could have been processed through the magnificent south building.,POSITIVE
Anchorage,airport,Christopher Dore,8/13/2013,Be aware the International terminal has only one shop that sells duty free goods. The only alcohol sold is a restricted choice of whiskeys and they only sell a restricted selection of cigarettes.,NEUTRAL
Anchorage,airport,M McManus,10/16/2011,Went to Anchorage in late 2011. Airport has some restaurants on the security side of the airport but not a good choice and the quality was not too good. The gift shops on the other hand are excellent especially if you are looking for Native American art. Be warned that quite a few souvenirs are like snow shakers with water which will be taken off you by security if you need to pass through them again. Information screens were useful. Plenty of seating and quite a view out of the terminal window.,NEUTRAL
Ancona,airport,Stephen Smith,9/12/2022,"Very clean Airport, friendly helpful staff, great that it’s all on one level. My departure was late 11.00pm and was disappointed in the fact that the duty free shop was closed. Also it took a while for the cafe bar to open and I wanted a pizza slice heated up which the assistant was reluctant to do , but I said I would wait. When we got through passport control all seating was taped off so a huge bunch of passengers, and some sitting in the floor. No staff around for about 20 mins. Some passengers lifted up the tape to sit down so a majority followed only to be asked to move out 10 mins later. Also no Air conditioning so it was hot and sweaty. So I would say this Airport is not good for later flights.",NEGATIVE
Ancona,airport,3 reviewsBen Apsley,12/17/2015,"Being a frequent traveler to Ancona Airport, I have expectations that are met every time. Since this airport is so tiny, check-in and security are a breeze. The single terminal is fairly clean and peaceful. The Italian shops have what you expect. The only problem I have with this airport is that you can't get coffee in the terminal. This isn't much of a problem, though, because you can simply get it outside. There isn't anything wrong with this airport but, it's not extraordinary. It is very relaxed and is a good airport.",POSITIVE
Ankara,airport,Vinoth Govindaraj,9/5/2024,"I had a very disappointing experience. The gate number wasn’t mentioned on the boarding pass, and the staff were rude and unresponsive.

Overall, the airport offered very poor service with no regard for customer satisfaction. Worst experience I’ve had at an airport.",NEGATIVE
Ankara,airport,Badon Ghijben,11/3/2023,"What a poor airport. There is no route from domestic arrivals to international. The international departures is the most chaotic of airports with too few passport controls. A first quality should be mastery of an international English, no one speaks English.",NEGATIVE
Ankara,airport,Mohd Shabsog,6/3/2023,"During the midnight of 3rd/4th of June during a transit flight, I had the displeasure of dealing with a poorly coordinated security team. Under normal circumstances I would highly recommend this airport as I have traveled through it before. To put things in context, I was on a transit trip that had a 1 hour period between the departure of the arrival from the earlier destination and the departure of the subsequent flight. Given the time constraint, one would imagine there to be a better overall coordination among the staff. There was particularly poor coordination between those who worked at security checks and those at passport control. The staff at security checks not only allowed over 15 people to cut through the long queue sporadically without any consequence or moderation, they also performed unnecessary performative “passport checks” (granted we had already done actual complete passport around 5 meters earlier). A lot of the questions asked seemed performative as well, it seemed as if they were more interested in it the appearance of doing their job while simultaneously doing it at a slow pace without maintaining any sense of order. Thankfully, it did not cost me the flight but I would urge there to be better coordination in the future as I’m fully aware from previous experience that the staff at the airport can do better.",NEGATIVE

Airport is bit far away from the city center and people don't have cheap and fast options to get to this airport so sometimes passengers spend more time travelling to the airport. Finally, parking areas of Esenboğa Airport are very expensive, small and complicated. Generally passengers spend more than 15 minutes finding a parking place.",NEGATIVE
Ankara,airport,2 reviewsÖzgün Gündoğdu,8/12/2017,"I stayed for 12 hours at Ankara Airport because of a transit flight issue. At arrival there was no guidance. I can't say anything about queues being a transit passenger. There was so many flies at the airport so terminal was not so clean. Hard, metal seating of terminal was bad if you have to wait more then 3 hours to my experience. There was a coffee shop with better seating though prices were high. If you want to have a meal at the airport, keep in mind that prices are very high than outside of the airport. Shops are not many but you can satisfy your basic needs if you choose. Staff was somewhat invisible at night and not helpful at day. Wifi at coffee shop was free but I didn't find any other free wifi. Flights were generally delayed due to planes lining up to take off.",NEGATIVE

Security is very fast and efficient and connecting to and from the city is fairly easy with a shuttle bus that costs 11TL. Unfortunately, like all Turkish airports, to get free wi-fi you need a code sent to your mobile; so if you're traveling and don't have a sim card that works then you're out of luck. Otherwise it's not a problem.",POSITIVE

The airport itself though was very nice, clean with lots of places for food and beverages, although service at a couple of those places left a bit to be desired. There was also a little play area near our gate for our son. We hired a trolley from outside but there was nowhere to drop it off inside - you had to go out and then go back in via security so we just abandoned ours in the hall! Several other people had done the same and we saw someone gather them - a small thing that can be easily fixed. Security very fast and nice man on duty.",NEGATIVE
Ankara,airport,Mehmet Arca,1/25/2013,I have used it many times. New Esenboga Airport is excellent. Comfortable clean helpful staff. Duty free is small but can find everything.

ANR Robinson International,airport,Michael Hanwell,2/24/2025,"I thought that Piarco Airport, Trinidad was bad. But on this paradise of a Caribbean island the airport security Staff take first place for rudeness, ignorance and sheer stupidity. I witnessed several ridiculous requests for children to remove shoes, for a crying toddler to pass through the scanner unaccompanied, for harmless items to taken out of a women's handbag, passengers being ordered around as though they were in prison. No requests for passengers to do something,, only a command, ""you, come forward "". Step back. Not a single please throughout all that I saw. Welcome to Tobago.",NEGATIVE

Small water bottle 3 Euros, smallest coffee 7 Euros. Air conditioning not working properly, very hot on the 2nd floor, and I am talking about mid November, not July! Poor standards all over the place.",NEGATIVE
Antalya,airport,Samy Meindorf,11/16/2024,"Unqualified and very rude security staff. Disinterested and indifferent employees in the shops. Food disproportionately expensive for the poor quality. After more than a month (we were there in October 2024), I am still speechless about what I experienced at Antalya Airport. It seems that the airport staff despise tourists, and they are not aware about the importance of tourism as a major source of income for the country which provides many jobs. One thing is clear to me: I will not be flying to Antalya again.",NEGATIVE
Antalya,airport,J Walsh,10/13/2024,"Horrid, probably one of the worst airports, I've traveled a lot and have never seen something like that. Filthy and unclean. There is not enough seating area for everyone in the departures. People seat by the gates as there is nowhere to sit down and airport staff closes the area off and kicks people out! Security at the gate whhen coming back to the UK is partially gimmick that needs to be brought to the attention of the UK authorities. Airport staff has numbers to tick off, and once they hit their target of people to be searched, they sign the list off and don't search any more people! This way those who arrive later are likely not to be checked. Due to this a big group of rowdy lads was not asked to go through security check today as staff hit their target for the flight.  Prices are unbelievably expensive - 2 pieces of small, cold pizza and Pepsi 20 euro. Burgers 20+ euro, bottle of water 8+ euro. Overall a very bad airport.",NEGATIVE
Antalya,airport,F Reade,9/10/2024,"Without doubt, the worst airport I have visited. I'll be straight and honest. We will return again as Side in Turkey is an amazing town. But I'm sure this region deserves a better airport. It's like a cattle market with nowhere near enough seating if you plan on eating. And that's just the start. Tin of local lager (Effes) €12. Unbelievable. Small wine €11. Blamed on Inflation, yet the shop directly across from these stalls(photo attached) same wine, €3.50. Bottles of IPA beer €4.00 So, more likely extortion. And if you are lucky enough to get a seat to sip your vastly overpriced sandwich & drink, you'll be surrounded by thousands of wandering passengers begging for a seat to consume their golden meal.",NEGATIVE
Antalya,airport,N Carlan,9/5/2024,"Antalya airport is the most expensive airport I have ever been to. The prices are extortionate, for anything from the duty free to the various cafes and fast food restaurants, for the price you expect the food to be at least hot, the food was cold and stale. I just do not understand how they can charge so much for bad quality food. I understand airports are expensive but this was a different level of expensive. The rest of the airport is alright, easy to find where you’re going and helpful staff. You did have to go through double security once at the door and after you check in your luggage, so be mindful to not buy any drinks from downstairs. Also there is no airport WiFi you have to pay. Overall I will not be returning to Antalya because even outside of the airport prices are extortionate and vendors do not know how to trade in their own currency of lira. Everything is in Euros.",NEGATIVE
Antalya,airport,Ruben Turner,9/1/2024,So expensive. Yes I know that airports are known to be expensive but this was astonishingly expensive. 14 euros for a cab of beer. The restaurant we ate at was unpleasantly busy and when we finally got our food when we were about to sit down this random woman and came and took our chairs and then other people had to give their chairs to us which quite frankly is disgusting behaviour. The queues are massive and the landing from the flight wasn't the best. It's a pretty bad airport.,NEGATIVE
Antalya,airport,A Davies,8/31/2024,"Fairly straight forward on arrival but as others have said, departures is a bit of a joke. Very badly organised, zero aircon (probably to make you buy more drinks), massively over crowded with limited seating, no wifi, and the food and drink charges are utterly criminal. We paid £28 for 3x bags of chips from burger king. We also had 3x separate security checks including myself and 4yo boy being selected for ""random"" bag searches at the gate by possibly the most disinterested security team you'll ever witness. We had a great holiday overall but this airport really is a bit of a stain on the whole experience.",NEGATIVE
Antalya,airport,Gordon Nicol,8/25/2024,"Firstly, the first security checks are fine, I understand why there are so many before the departure gates. Prices are horrendous at burger king, Starbucks, Popeye's. lira to euro conversion makes the prices even worse - two meals from BK were 43euro. Our flight to Glasgow was departing at 00:45, gate opened around 23:30. UK Government imposed searches are a problem, the caveman doing the searches seemed to enjoy it. Arrogant, aggressive, intimidating. Felt like he wanted a reaction from passengers. He cracked my phone's screen protector and emptied a females toiletries bag onto a table in front of everyone. Humiliating, 'I can do what I like and you can't do anything about it' attitude. Almost half the men on the flight got this treatment and if any of us met him under different circumstances.... At the departure gate there were around 300 seats, however half were cordoned off for some unknown reason. 150 seats were sat on while the other 100 or so passengers stood around us looking at the forbidden seats. Horrible vibe, horrible prices, horrible staff.",NEGATIVE
Antalya,airport,David Stewart,8/25/2024,"Arrival simple. Through immigration quickly as in most Turkish airports. Departures is a totally different story. It's not organised chaos just chaos. Totally third world. Check in a nightmare. Despite checking in online have to queue for paper boarding card. Next are the passport control lines. To be fair this is probably the quickest bit of the constant queues. Security next which is crazy. They're either talking to each other or screaming at some passenger. Duty free. This is like a endurance test. Incompetent isn't a strong enough description. After 25 minutes waiting due to some poor girl with obviously no experience I managed to get a supervisor who's first excuse was ""system problems"" which was a fairytale as she put the goods through right away. Lounge. An utter disaster of a place. Overbooked and they couldn't care less. Some Russian guy (employee!!) acting like a doorman in a sleazy nightclub outrageously deciding who could and couldn't get in. By this point I lost the plot and the only thing I was told by the lounge ""supervisor"" was that sometimes Russian people sound cheeky!!! I wasn't in Russia was in Turkey and expect even basic manners. After getting in there were numerous staff members from Fraport Technik and others enjoying coffees cigarettes and chatting but for passengers it's full????? Finally the extra security check at the gate is laughable. They do check some passengers but once boarding commences they just leave even although still about a third of the flight not even entered the gate area. All in all it's a horrendous place. Fraport should hang their heads in shame but they will never do anything about until the travelling public vote with their feet and go elsewhere unless there is a compelling need to be in AYT.",NEGATIVE
Antananarivo,airport,O Stein,8/19/2018,"Their new terminal looks far from finished, and the existing buildings are probably what you'd expect in one of the worlds poorest countries. At immigration people from back in the queue kept being prioritised through, and we were asked for a tip from an official loading our luggage through the scanner. Random officials asked for our documents for no apparent reason and we fought off some very aggressive people wanting to assist with our luggage.

Antananarivo,airport,1 reviewsL Shaw,9/10/2017,"I passed through this airport 4 times during August and September 2017. Arrived and Departed for flights to Europe (2x) and Internal flights (2x). I agree with everything recently written but add a few additional points. 1) Watch out for the Euro coin scammers. Locals trying to exchange euro coins for notes. They will show you 20 Euros in coins and ask for a note in exchange. They are expert at a sleight of hand confidence trick. You will not get the correct change once they count it out for you. 2) There is a cafe on the first floor of international departures that is open 24x7 and is the only non-airside seating area. Particularly useful if your flight is delayed and are awaiting check in to open. 3) The Duty Free was open until 0100 am for the Air France Paris flight 4) I flew Kenyan Airlines to Nairobi, this was a flight originating in Mozambique or Reunion but assigned seat was not available as the transiting passengers were already stretched out over all seats. It ended up as a free for all for the remaining free seats.",NEUTRAL
Antananarivo,airport,C Nelson,8/23/2016,"Madagascar is a wonderful country but Antananarivo airport is so poor that it really makes visiting a trial. For entry I counted that my passport was checked 6 times from leaving the aircraft until finally getting into our taxi. No idea why, but it took a long time. You must have the entry fee (around 25 euros per person for short stay) in cash (Euros, Dollar and Pounds accepted). If you don't, staff escort you landside to a cash point and bring you back. There are numerous stamps and writing and more queuing, all of which seems totally superfluous. People that look like staff often aren't and are the 'porters'. They are very aggressive - there's no point trying to take your own bag, unless it's strapped to you as they take it and then expect to be paid. It is also very difficult to keep it to just 1 porter, again expecting to be paid. I know it's a poor country, but some regulation of these porters is required, especially coming airside. I suppose overall, the time to clear wasn't that bad as they saved that for the exit. Again, there was the obsession with passport checks - 5 times it was checked, as well as my finger prints being taken - no idea why on exit, but not on entry. That wasn't the worst - our hotel delivered us 2 hours and 30 mins before the departure. We were about half way down the check-in queue. The plane had a capacity of 89 people. Checking-in took 2 hours. The cabin bags had labels too - not required in other locations. Some people seemed to have a check-in form, but we didn't need one. After that, then they said a form had to be filled-in, with lots of totally irrelevant information. Similar to the form on entry with info like where you stayed. The form wasn't available whilst you queued for check-in. Another member of staff then turned up, offering a pen and wanting to be paid - we had no currency left by then. Then there were more checks and the finger print scan. A baggage check until finally getting through to departures. By the time we got through, the plane was already boarding, so I didn't see the departure lounge. In the end the plane was 30 mins late departing due to these delays. Overall a really poor experience, which would be so easy to improve. My recommendation is to keep your bags close (not for security reasons), be very specific what help you need / want and for departures, be there 3 hours in advance.",NEGATIVE
Antananarivo,airport,Arnold DeVries,2/18/2016,"Antananarivo airport is pretty efficient overall however, if you are flying domestically be aware that there is only one shop with nothing other than some packaged snacks and water to buy after you go through security. Nothing landside either. Seats are all wood. International terminal - quickly whisked through the place as I had Sky Priority on Air France. Bit chaotic and had to navigate people who would just take your bags to ""help"" you along. Just say ""non merci"". There are shops beyond security to buy and spend your money in the International Terminal. AF Business Lounge was warm but a nice respite from the otherwise warm and wooden benched area to wait for departure. A lot of checking your bags and paperwork in both terminals. No jetways - need to walk up some fairly rickety stairs to the plane. Had toyed with the idea of killing a 15 hour layover there before a 2am AF departure, but was feeling sick so hit a hotel for a rest. Glad I did as it is not a airport to kill that much time. Functional but could improve.",NEGATIVE

We won’t be back anytime soon. And nor should you, unless you love line ups.",NEGATIVE
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,E Davids,2/7/2018,"Clean, with efficient staff. Plenty of bathrooms available before and after gates. We were out of there in 30 min coming in. Small shopping/duty free area on the way out. Gates were just as efficient. One runway. Expensive, limited food choices. I suggest getting souvenirs before the airport. 10+ experience.",POSITIVE
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,Helena Wallace,12/17/2016,"This is the worst airport I have experienced. There are restaurants but it seems they only cook half the menu after 6pm and it is not food I would choose to eat anyway. Digusting! Airport trolleys are not allowed in arrivals. How ridiculous. You have to pay a porter if you want to use a trolley. If you get delayed (which is likely) there are the most uncomfortable plastic seating you will ever encounter, where sleeping is not an option. Finally, never use Liat airlines unless you leave at least 48 hours to get to your island destination.",NEGATIVE
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,Trevor Shadrack,6/8/2016,Antigua airport is new but very confusing - there are not many clear signs to direct you where to go. The queues through immigration were very long and staff very abrupt asking in my opinion pointless questions. The customs officers direct you to the something to declare line when you are heading towards nothing to declare and again ask unnecessary questions and take all your belongings out out the case. Dreadful start to a holiday. Very rude and unprofessional compared to other countries. On departure same experience - staff unprofessional having conversation with colleagues and unhelpful and abrupt.,NEGATIVE
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,Sue Samuel,6/1/2016,"Sadly had to spend 3 hours in the check in area at Antigua airport awaiting a transatlantic flight - not a pleasant experience. No really worth going off site, or so we thought. Scarcely any seats and those available were not suitable for long delays, but nothing else was available. The tiny cafe closed about ten minutes after our arrival mid-afternoon. The excuse given was 'it's Sunday'. No water machine or vending machine available. The A/C worked over efficiently and it was bitterly cold. After an efficient check in and passage through normal airport procedures, enter into the departure area. This is large and open with the potential for many outlets and stores. However very few are in use, really no more than were in the original old terminal. We were told that rents are excessive and that is why few are in use. Prices were excessive - $8 for a small bottle of water. In summary, the airport works efficiently as far as boarding airplanes is concerned but not for passengers with long waits, either inside or outside departures. WiFi is very good.",NEGATIVE
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,A Frankowski,5/6/2016,"The new terminal at Antigua airport has only been open for a few months, and it is quite magnificent. It's up there with the best European airports, although not anywhere near as large. The 2 duty-free shops are amazing - particularly their rum selections which include Clement Rhum Agricole from Martinique and some genuine sugar cane syrup to mix it with. The souvenir shop also looked very good, although I didn't have enough time to look round it in great detail.",POSITIVE
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,Steve Tait,3/24/2016,"This is a brand new terminal that opened just about nine months ago. It is very well designed, spacious, light filled and comfortable with a limited yet sufficient number of traveler facilities. Immigration both coming in and departing was quick and easy. My only gripe is with the terminal and gate announcement system. Every announcement in the airport, even at the gate, was totally garbled and not understandable. There is something horribly wrong with the announcement system which really needs some immediate attention.",POSITIVE
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,K Troy,2/13/2016,"I have visited dozens of airports in many countries. The arrival, departure and security experiences were all as expected. What I found shocking, however, were the shops in the terminal and their pricing practices, which could be referred to as a downright scam. The shops and restaurants do not display prices on their items. You have to ask a clerk how much each item is, and they seem to make it up on the spot. And they will quote you an already exorbitant price in EC$ and then tell you another ridiculous price if you want to pay in US$. I was just told that a small bottle of water was $5US, and that a banana (a single banana) would be $7US.",NEGATIVE
Antigua Vc Bird,airport,P Cullen,3/17/2015,I did not find Antigua as bad as some but it was not exactly trouble free. Immigration took about 40 minutes bad but I have suffered worse elsewhere and the officer was polite and welcoming. Departure is rather chaotic you queue to check-in (about 20 minutes in our case) and to go through emigration (over 30 minutes) though security was cleared quickly. Once in the terminal it was crowded but had (just) enough seating. The snack bar was reasonably priced but souvenirs can be found cheaper elsewhere on the island. The good news (hopefully) is that the new terminal building is complete and due to open in the next few weeks according to locals it is much larger than the present one and looks a better design - there are several dedicated piers for large aircraft. Antigua is a great island and I look forward to experiencing the new facilities.,POSITIVE
Antwerp Deurne,airport,M Kuminate,3/29/2016,"Small airport, yet very efficient. Don't come too early as there is not much to do. Queuing is almost non-existent, staff (check-in and security) are very friendly. There is a restaurant with view on the tarmac and a small airport shop before the security. Arrival is very fast (5 to 10 minutes, including bagage reclaim). There is a bus stop right before the terminal, taking you to Antwerpen-Berchem train station (a major train station with fast connection to Brussels or anywhere in Belgium). Very close to the city center. Highly recomended for users who like 'fast' airports.",POSITIVE
Antwerp Deurne,airport,Anthony Kent,1/12/2016,"Antwerp used to be my favourite airport. Anybody traveling regularly between the Antwerp/Eindhoven regions and London has been well-served (though other destinations are limited). The highish fares were offset by the fact that free parking was available. As of late 2015 this situation has changed, however, as all the parking areas have been enclosed and high charges imposed for parking. Regrettably, therefore, although the airport is small and very pleasant to use, it can no longer compete financially with Eindhoven and I will no longer be using it.",NEGATIVE
Antwerp Deurne,airport,C Wajsberg,10/27/2012,Very small airport with not many destinations to fly to from. Free parking in front of airport very fast check in. One restaurant coffee shop with nice local food. Arriving at Antwerp airport it will take you around 5 to 10 after disembarking until you receive your suitcase and are in a taxi home.,POSITIVE
Antwerp Deurne,airport,S Smith,5/7/2010,So refreshing to be able to use Duerne instead of Brussels. Less than 3 minutes from plane to car this week and that included collecting a bag. On return I checked in about 45 minutes before the flight hardly any queue.,POSITIVE
Antwerp Deurne,airport,S Smith,12/20/2009,Fantastic airport. I go in and out at least once a month. Yesterday I timed my arrival and from walking off the plane to being outside at a taxi was 43 seconds!!! 15 minute check in for departures.,POSITIVE
Antwerp Deurne,airport,Karel Hladky,7/21/2008,What an amazing little airport ! All flights depart from Gate 1 - there being only Gate 1. Nice little shop the restaurant is being rebuilt. Do not arrive too early for your flight as everything shuts in-between flights.,POSITIVE

Antwerp Deurne,airport,H van der Maarel,4/26/2007,ANR-LCY vv. recently with VLM. Early morning flight on a Saturday back on a Monday evening. Antwerp is a small airport and due to the low number of passengers it functions efficiently and fast. My time from plane to car on the way back was about 10 minutes which includes waiting for my luggagee !,POSITIVE
Antwerp Deurne,airport,Michael Newport,8/16/2005,Great airport not many flights so no hassle. From check in to take off 15 minutes. Car parking also free !,POSITIVE
Arkhangelsk,airport,Y Kiselev,10/3/2010,Used this airport on numerous occasions over the last 20 years. Over the last year (2010) both domestic and international terminals underwent some renovation and rearrangement of facilities - in my opinion for the better. Of all facilities/services expectable from a mid-size regional airport ARH lacks free WI-FI coverage and cafes serving hot meals. Overall it is a decently well-kept airport which may though benefit from further renovations and improvements.,POSITIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,Helen Mondeo,1/14/2025,Lines are backed up at this airport with only 2 luggage scanners working. We stood in a hardly not moving line for 2.30 hrs and almost missed our flight. The staff seems to work hard but doesn’t explain anything as to what is causing the backed up lines. Not looking forward to travelling to Aruba because of the horrible departure.,NEGATIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,Pam Thompson,10/7/2024,I like Aruba after I get thru the airport. But shame on the people in charge for creating this situation. You charge $130 for a fast track while only having two attendants working the regular kiosk. At least six to eight people selling the fast track. Two to three hours standing to get through the regular customs. People around us stating they will not return. Not encouraging returns visits. Shame on Aruban authorities.,NEGATIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,Calvin Black,7/17/2024,Worst airport in world! Line was outdoor in sun for security. No order or direction. Happy city is a joke the staff mostly rude. Security broke daughter book at and yanked son bracelet off. You have to carry your checked back to a longer custom line where there rude. Dirty airport no cleaning seems done. And of course Aruba prices are insane.,NEGATIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,C Sullivan,6/30/2024,"Absolutely horrible experience at the airport. Waited for 4 hours to finally get on our plane. Had our passports checked no less than 7x. Had to wait outside in blazing heat for about 30 minutes. Have to clear both US and Aruba security. Why?? Entire 4 hours spent standing. At the end, our flight was boarding and they were allowing people to jump in front of us. Finally had to push our luggage in front of others to get them to stop putting others before is. TSA agent was downright nasty. I dont expect to return to Aruba again.",NEGATIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,Nancy Cooley,3/30/2024,"Horrible disorganized process for checking in. No advantage having a global entry card. Rental car return does not open until 0800. First of many check in’s doesn’t open until 0830 but the one employee checking people in wasn’t ready until 0845. Long line by then. Very strange process to go through X-ray line twice. If this were a better organized process, this could happen once",NEGATIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,Gary Shust,7/31/2023,"I came here to see if it was just me, but I can see that all the issues - plus many more - have been reported by many already - going back several years. What is Aruba waiting for? This was by far the worst, most miserable departure we've ever experienced. What - they don't trust their own security that they make you go through it twice? And the biggest head-scratcher of all: checked luggage. Who thought of the ingenious idea of making you check your luggage, then search a huge room for it later along with everyone else? Just idiotic. I can't believe how bad and lacking in common sense their processes are. Like many others, we loved the island. However, just thinking about the hassle getting back home makes me think twice about returning.",NEGATIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,J Jay,12/26/2022,"This airport's organization is a disaster. Expect to wait in numerous, disorganized lines for up to 3 hours before you get to your gate. New this year is a ""Fast Track"" service where you pay a fee to get through the lines (I guess the long lines are by design to make extra cash). They were working hard at making the departure experience better for US tourists. I guess that ended when the new fee for service program came into play. The employees either don't know securities procedures or don't care. They give you the wrong answer to simply questions. They are super nice and helpful when you arrive but could care less when you are leaving. Never transit here on Saturday. Sundays are getting overcrowded as well, probably because of the time of year. Terrible airport experience. Only bonus is clearing US Customs so you don't have to at home, but some of those agents are just down right nasty and obnoxious.",NEGATIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,P Geyre,8/31/2022,"Stood in horrible lines for more than 3 hours. Completely unnecessary! Absolutely no organization, staff never gave explanations or even good directions. One employee kept hollering for “customers, please keep moving!” As if we wanted to stand still? In several instances, we saw employees give special treatment to some by opening lines for people to bypass longer lines to join shorter ones that were completely blocked off except for this reason. The final time my husband and I saw it happen, which was opened, literally, just behind us, we snuck through too while said employee was busy looking for others (of their choosing) to go through. We were fast tracked through customs in minutes. We had not eaten before because we thought 3 1/2 hours in small airport would have left plenty of time to eat at a restaurant in the airport. Nope, I barely had time to get aunt Annie’s (while my husband used that time to take a quick trip to the bathroom, I had to use airplane toilet). We got to our gate while plane was boarding (ate on plane). As we were boarding plane I noticed people just arriving, that had been in line with us before we snuck out, 25 minutes later. Aruba, amazing time but we will never go back because of airport.",NEGATIVE
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,J Allen,8/28/2022,The worst airport I have ever been in spent 4hrs waiting in line to get through customs. The gate agents just don’t care to help.

Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,T Butz,4/2/2022,"Could not be worse run. The absolute model of inefficiency. The say allow 3 hours to check in, and they mean it. Line 1 - cue to enter, docs checked. Line 2 covid test verification Line 3 bag tags docs checked. Line 4 Aruba customs docs checked. Line 5 go through screening docs checked, Line 6 reclaim bags, Line 7 check bags again docs checked, Line 8 US customs docs checked, Line 9 go through screening again - I’m not kidding you have to have your carryon and yourself screened twice. You have to drop off, reclaim and drop off your bag again. My passport and boarding pass was checked no less than 5 times. I had to answer the screening questions 3 times. I booked a repeat visit and have now canceled it. The only reason for 2 stars not one is that there is a nice wine bar but chances are you won’t get to enjoy it as you waste your life away in hours upon hours of senseless lines. The airport process is an astonishing failure in customer service.",NEGATIVE
Ashgabat,airport,S King,6/30/2019,"Ashgabat is a big airport with very limited traffic. Arrived very early in the morning and had to queue at the visa desk which took just on two hours. If you don't have a visa prior to arrival you can get one at the airport, the process is quite long and takes a lot of time. First you queue in the visa line and hand over document and passport. Then you queue at the cash desk which can take a lot of time to hand over the money and the tourist tax (which everyone has to pay so this line is the busiest), once done with that back to the visa desk to get the documents back (the cashier desk only accept USD some people had euros which caused some delays. They have to be post 2003 clean and crisp otherwise they won't accept it). They have fingerprint scanners which sometimes work or not. Then immigration which the guy was lovely and was very welcoming, one of the best immigration experiences I have had in a while. Your passport gets checked again before going down the escalator which has an amazing green hand rail. Luggage was waiting for me then go through customs and have passport checked again to leave. Airport officials will ask for bribes and will charge you if your unlucky they also don't give change. It's a cool airport yet it's forbidden to take photos which is strange.",NEGATIVE
Aspen Pitkin County,airport,B Frank,4/18/2020,"We were returning back home to Virginia via ORD and our ASE to ORD flight got cancelled. The main lobby and check-in/ticketing area of Aspen Airport does not have a vending machine for even water. TSA did not allow already checked-in passengers to go through security and wait in the gates section due to some ""safety"" issue due to overcrowding in the gates area. We had to wait five hours. Twice I went to the bathroom and through a windowed door you could see the gate area with FEW people while the front of the airport building was overcrowded with unhappy and angry passengers. I already sent my complaint to American Airlines. This issue of no water, soda or food for hours is not acceptable in todays world. For sure I have no desire to visit Aspen due to this awful airport and airline experience.",NEGATIVE
Astana,airport,Adrian Pritchard,2/26/2023,"Astana Airport feels more like a bus station than an international airport. It's tiny! That said, staff are friendly and will go out of their way to help you buy and install a Sim card. There are a few of the usual taxi touts but not too many and they accept no. There are a few shops but none of those annoying overpriced boutiques which is a good thing! Wifi appeared to work.",NEGATIVE
Astana,airport,4 reviewsAlan Sargeant,10/23/2019,"I arrived in Nur Sultan Airport from Novosibirsk, Russia and left to go to Almaty. The Immigration control was quite fast and no problems in getting a 15 day Visa on arrival. The airport is relatively new and modern. Security was efficient and effective. I had a couple of hours between flights and wanted to recharge phone and computer. There was plenty of seating but there were very few places and none adjacent to a seat where I could charge my computer. I watched it from about 10 metres away. The airport has all the things that interest some people - money exchange, tourist souvenirs etc. I seldom shop in airports.",NEUTRAL
Astana,airport,E Alter,9/29/2018,"This airport while still considered fairly new is still so very basic. The upstairs 3rd floor so called food court is a joke. The food is so basic, stale & expensive for what you get. With their limited English it makes it harder also. 3 of the places were on a break but still had limited menu. This food court needs a fast food outllet like most international airports. Most staff were friendly but facilities while clean are basic.",POSITIVE
Astana,airport,1 reviewsK Singh,9/29/2018,The airport is quite small but well maintained. There is no drinking water facilities for passengers. A 500ml bottle of water at this airport costs 1 euro.

There were hardly any English announcements.,NEGATIVE
Astana,airport,J Edlow,9/21/2017,"The brand new terminal is now open and is spectacular. Any deficiencies from previous reviews are now remedied. More gates with jetways, more shops and restaurants. Check in was seamless as was immigration facilities. Clean and modern and when the new train system is functioning, it will be easy to get into the city.",POSITIVE
Astana,airport,8 reviewsMaarten Caspers,12/23/2016,"Astana is a small international airport, that is well connected to Europe via Frankfurt, London, Paris and Amsterdam through Kazakhstan's Air Astana. The airport has only one terminal for Domestic and International flights. A new terminal is being constructed next to the existing facility which is planned to be opening in spring 2017. The arrivals and baggage reclaim is small. Immigration quite smooth and officers were friendly, but remember to fill in your immigration card with a blue or black pen, not with a red one as it is not accepted. I had almost no queues. Taxi pick-up at the terminal is not well-organised and taxi recruiters can be annoying. The central hall for departures is quite spacious and there is sufficient seating around the check-in area. Check-in areas are small and somewhat old-fashioned, but work fine. Friendly ground staff. Short queuing time at check-in, passport control and security. Emigration passport control is fine. There are few F&B and retail facilities at the international departure gates. There is plenty of seating at the end of the concourse close to the small cafe in the back. Transferring between international flights is quick and easy. Passengers do not have to pass immigration, only security screening. It took me only 5-10 minutes from arrival gate to departure gate. F&B and retail facilities are limited, especially in the departure are after immigration. Food choice is limited. Very good wifi while waiting for check-in or for your flight. Password can be obtained via SMS. Terminal and toilets are clean. Remote arrivals and departures (via bus) in winter when temperatures can go below -20 Celsius can be cold and slippery, but also a very interesting experience. When the new terminal will be opened in 2017 I assume less aircraft will be handled via busses.",POSITIVE
Astana,airport,18 reviewsAiyaphol Kemapuckpong,8/31/2016,"When I arrived at Astana Airport, the structure was reminiscent of the soviet-era. The arrivals was less organised, with the baggage claim being crammed into one spot that is too small. Check in at this airport is close to impossible, Air Astana only use two or three counters for economy class and one for business. The security check is organised, the gates are organised, the cafès are nicely organised, but the staff could speak a little bit more English. Passport control takes a little bit too long, but not as long as some airports.",NEUTRAL
Astana,airport,Alibek Taizhanov,7/31/2013,Astana airport is small but very good. The staff is ok. The wifi connection works pretty well queuing times are very short. There is only a few shops in the airport but that seems to be enough for it. The exterior and interior design is very good.,POSITIVE
Astana,airport,M Foote,9/5/2011,This airport has excellent free wifi but lacks any decent shops or restaurants. I stayed in the airport for 5 hrs whilst waiting for a connecting flight. The check-in agent wouldn't check my bag through so I was stuck at the airport. The best area for wifi is on the 2nd floor. There are power-points behind the bench seats for charging your laptop. Airside there are small shops and a cafe/bar at the very end of the departure lounge where the wifi doesn't work. As a capital city airport it is lacking in many of the things one would expect. Without the wifi it would be very hard to pass the time waiting for connecting flights.,NEGATIVE
Astana,airport,Jack Sheldon,11/2/2006,Small ultramodern terminal. Check-in was fairly efficient except for flatheads who queue-jumped. In the end I had to spread my elbows to get attention. Business-class desk not manned. Unable to check-in bags or myself to connecting flights (even on the same airline). There’s not a great deal to do in the airport whilst waiting for flights. Once airside all there is is a small bar. In theory the terminal is non- smoking though there is a separate smoking room but the whole terminal smelt of smoke most of the time I was there.,NEUTRAL
Asturias,airport,N White,7/8/2012,A great little regional airport located right on the edge of the coast whose baggage reclaim passport control and lounge are all currently being refurbished and expanded. The airport is clean and tidy and has a delightful cafe/restaurant downstairs before security as well as a great little shop selling local artisan products. Check- in can be slow as there are no self-service check-in facilities. Note that once you go past security facilities are currently fairly scant (small bar area and no shops).,POSITIVE
Asturias,airport,Roland Rodriguez,7/5/2010,Went to OVD on a day trip from BCN in mid June 2010 to visit family in nearby Castrillon. I seen the airport evolve for the last thirty years into a very nice compact and efficient operation. Everything is laid out in a logical sequence. You arrive into a small check-in area as there are still less than a half dozen or so carriers that use it go through a quick and orderly screening area and up to the gates. There are various shops to include a regional Asturias gift shop stores transportation outlets and the such. Public areas are clean and not crowded by any means. There is the typical cafe with lots of room and reasonable pricing. We found taxis right outside the terminal along with two bays for ALSA busses running to both Oviedo and Gijon. Be advised that the trip to the provincial cities of Oviedo Gijon and Aviles all take about a half hour or so to get to. All in all a very nice user-friendly airport.,POSITIVE
Asturias,airport,Martyn Davies,3/15/2006,Nice clean provincial airport handy for Asturias Cantabria and Galicia. The check-in hall is spacious and on the occasions I've used it it has always been hassle-free. The cafe is large and reasonably priced and the toilets clean. There are a half dozen care hire booths in the airport. I always use the bus to get into and out of Oviedo. It is cheap (@5 euros single) and runs regularly from the stop outside the arrivals hall. Regular buses also run to Gijon and Aviles. There are plentiful taxis if you want a more expensive drive in. The only mild criticism I have of the airport is the time it takes to get through customs on arrival. Other than that a pleasant airport which nearly makes flying pleasurable.,POSITIVE
Asuncion Silvio Pettirossi,airport,Jonathan Lacoste,2/6/2006,Asuncion is a small and simple airport. From airport gate to curbside the distance is no more than 50 meters. Upon arrival on AA (this was last month before AA cancelled their service to ASU) immigration was quick and efficient but baggage claim seemed to take forever. I must’ve waited for over 40 minutes which was unusual. Baggage claim in ASU is slow but not that slow. Be prepared when arriving into Asuncion’s baggage claim area to be swarmed by baggage porters looking to make a big tip. As soon as you tell one “no” another one will approach you. Departure wise the departure hall is not that big and can easily get crowded. Especially between the hours of 1600-1800 when flights to Buenos Aires and a couple of flights to Sao Paulo are departing around that time block. It seems in Asuncion when one person is going out of the country at least six relatives show up to say goodbye. Thus the departure hall can easily turn into a sea of people. There are two small restaurants on each side of the departure hall but these were full of departing passengers and their large number of relatives/friends. Check-in quick and efficient. AA had Asuncion’s departure tax already included in the ticket price so I skipped the departure tax window. I’m not sure if Varig does the same and Dale’s review answers the question on TAM. No line for immigration and it’s off to wait in the departure gate area. A restaurant is inside that allows for a bite to eat or a final opportunity to sample Paraguay’s local beers. I always chose the latter. A number of street-style shops selling Paraguayan leather and lace products are located in the middle of the gate area. Between them and the duty free shop in the corner of the waiting area I really couldn’t find anything worth buying. Business class passengers on AA did not have a business class lounge to wait in and I saw no indication of one for Varig’s business class passengers either. TAM flights into Asuncion are all Y configured. ASU has made some improvements over the years such as the addition of the duty free shop. Overall Asuncion’s airport is a basic and “gets the job done” type of airport.,NEUTRAL
Asuncion Silvio Pettirossi,airport,Dale Hancock,1/27/2006,The Asuncion terminal is small – perhaps half a dozen gates. Arrival was simple – though the plane had to stop short of the jet way lower the cabin door / stairs then taxi up to the jetway (TAM uses Fokker jets). Through passport control with no issues. While waiting for the baggage to be unloaded we were “found” by a rep from the Hotel Excelsior (the $110/nt suite included pick-up & drop-off at the airport). He helped us through the customs line (though the help certainly wasn’t needed) then on to the outside world where another contact with our name awaited. I asked about money exchange (zero Guarani for tips) & the initial contact took us over to a Hertz booth where we exchanged money. Most likely not the best rate. In retrospect the first contact was probably a local minion with the ability to get through to the Customs area & pass himself off as our legitimate contact all for a little “propina” which he was not hesitant to ask for once we got to our car. For departure we left the hotel at 4:30 AM for our 6:00 AM flight arriving with just less than an hour before flight time. No problems. TAM was efficient this time (see report under SCL) and check-in was completed in 10 minutes or less. Then on to the airport tax window – to the left of the check-in counters & to the right of the entry for passport control. $25 US p/p departure tax. The lady didn’t have US dollar change so we paid $310000 Guarani – probably not a very good rate but it allowed us to leave the country with essentially zero local currency. Through the departure doors & the lady immediately to the left verifies you’ve paid your taxes & stamps the receipt. Then to the immigration officer. Again no problems. In the gate area with 30 minutes to spare. Harp music playing free drinks (coffee soda water) at a little TAM kiosk. Restrooms are difficult to find – to the right of gate 2. It’s 5:30 in the morning and a few of the duty-free (mostly local craft) shops are actually open. For such a poor country with limited resources ASU appears to be surprisingly well managed and efficient.,POSITIVE

Athens,airport,Mia Nielsen,6/25/2024,"This airport need to up their standards! Even though you check in and print your bag tag you still have to wait in line with everyone else, which kind of defeats the purpose. And the line moves so extremely slow. I’m sure the staff at the check in counters are lovely people but I have never seen anyone work slower. This resulted in a man from Aegean having to shout out for passengers to flights that were on closing because they couldn’t make it through the line on time. Then you finally get to security and here they have staff guiding you to the different security points but they seem to have no sense of which line is actually full - I was directed to the longest line. Overall not a good experience. Arrived to the airport at the estimated time but couldn’t even make it to my gate before they started boarding.",NEGATIVE

Athens,airport,G Chenia,4/14/2024,"We had airport assistance for my elderly mother, and the chap who met us at the plane (Giorgious) was excellent. He spoke very good English and was super courteous and respectful and helpful throughout our transit. He took us through immigration and then onto our lounge for a flight to London with Aegean Airlines. He knew us by name within an instant and always explained what was happening next. He should be celebrated. The staff at the boarding gates were also very courteous and respectful as well. I can’t speak highly enough of everyone we dealt with at Athens Airport. Even the ladies serving at the cafe, considering how busy it was, was excellent, friendly, and on point. It’s always a pleasure when you meet good people doing good things. Well done Athens airport!",POSITIVE
Athens,airport,Sylvia Cole,11/12/2023,"Flew with Easy jet arrival area before passport control had 1 male and 1 female toilet we were allowed to use. Staff sitting outside toilet chatting, horrendous queues. Passport control no better only two guys checking passports so really slow dealing with the flights arriving. Please bear this in mind when booking taxis, because it will take over an hour to get through and then a very long walk to the baggage reclaim. A lady walking up and down in high heels by the passport control, not sure what her job was but perhaps she could have helped with getting more resource for the passport area. This is worrying if you have another flight, ship or taxi to get it’s a complete shambles for arriving brits!",NEGATIVE
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,R Bayle,3/6/2025,Worst airport experience ever. It’s always awful coming here but this was the absolute worst. This was just a layover from Charleston to Phoenix. We landed at the gate and sat there for 30 minutes. We were told “we have no idea why we are not allowed to park at the gate”. They refused to let us off the plane. We called customer support pleading with them to hold off our second flight. They refused. We showed up 1 minute after timed departure and the plane was gone. They were no help with booking a hotel or assisting with finding solutions. Completely their fault we missed the plane. We were here 30 minutes before departure and they refused to let us get off the plane.,NEGATIVE
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,S Hayle,2/28/2025,"I was returning home to the US after visiting family in Europe. My flight from Amsterdam was delayed so I already knew that making my connecting flight was going to be tight. When we landed and reach the arrival gate, we started getting ready to department. Then CBP came on to the aircraft and started barking orders and telling everyone to sit down while they inspected the aircraft. This caused a delay of around 30 minutes before we could de-plane.  Then the TSA staff appeared to be on a power trip. Whilst I have only ever encountered polite and professional TSA staff at other airports, at Atlanta they seem to be specially trained to be rude and abusive to all passengers. They were randomly checking passengers - US Citizens - for additional security checks, with no explanation. Just barking orders. After this, dozens of us from this flight missed our connections. But by this time all the desks and transfer and help desks were closing down. Eventually we found one which was open. The customer service agent gave us hotel vouchers and instructed us to 'go down the stairs, you'll see a blue bus - that's the airport hotel shuttle bus'. Sounds simple? So a group of 30 or so of us go down and get on shuttle buses. And end up back at another part of the airport. Apparently there are around a dozen different blue buses, all going to different places. And no-one knows where, there are no signs and no-one to help. Eventually we arrived at the airport hotel, some three hours after we arrived in Atlanta. In short, this airport is a disaster. Rude, unknowledgeable and unhelpful staff in every department. Impossible to find one's way around. Avoid this airport if you can - even if it costs you more money. I would rate this 0/10 if I could.",NEGATIVE
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,R Riley,12/15/2024,"We flew into Atlanta on a Delta flight from Paris with a connection (from Atlanta) to Orlando. Once off the plane it was easy to get to and complete passport control. However, all required interactions/processes beyond passport control were chaotic, loud, noisy, and rude. Specifically, - Part of the CBP process requires international arrival passengers to claim and then recheck luggage (if connecting). We waited at the assigned and posted carousel for over 30 minutes and then heard an unidentified person (employee?) yell out the bags for our flight were coming up two baggage claim carousels at the same time. How are passengers expected to know bags are coming in on the assigned carousel AND another carousel not posted for the flight? - After picking up checked bags, there was no posted guidance as to where to go or what to do. We rounded a turn and three separate airport employees were yelling three different sets of directions. One said to get into a particular line/queue but said nothing about checked luggage drop off. So we got in line. A separate employee came over yelling that our checked bags needed to be dropped across the room...no signage identified this and the only direction was to get in the line...so how would we know? - After sorting out the checked baggage drop, we went to another line for a security checkpoint. At the beginning of the line some unidentifiable airport employee was standing off to the side talking with people and it was not at all obvious she had anything to do with the security screening process. So, we proceeded into the line where other passengers were waiting. The employee then yelled something rude at my wife who was ahead of me. I asked the rude employee what she wanted. She said ""open your passports to the photo page."" So while fumbling with my passport and holding my carry-on, I asked ""why, the line is so backed up it will be 30 minutes until we get into the security checkpoint?"" The obnoxious rude employee then said ""you'll need to step aside"" and continued her side conversation with others. She then blurted out to other passengers ""ya'll can pass him by, I don't know what he be doing."" So the employee wanted people to open the passport but she was not looking at the passports and further did not appear to be in any way part of security, TSA, etc. Her uniform resembled cleaning crew. To make this worse, after opening the passports, the next employee just before the security checkpoint was instructing passengers to put the passports back in the bags with other items to clear security screening. -The security screening process was simple enough but employees were yelling with no clue that multiple people yelling means few instructions are understood and passengers are offended by their interaction. In a nutshell, many of the employees in Atlanta stand around barking instructions that cannot be understood. Many of these people should be replaced with signs like most modern airports have. Once beyond passport control Atlanta seems to have few signs or posted instructions as to what is required when arriving on an international flight with a domestic connection. Other airports around the world are far better at informing passengers and in my experience are less likely to be yelling at people like they are herds of cattle. Many employees at the Atlanta airport are unnecessarily rude if asked any questions or if asked to repeat whatever they are yelling. Avoid Atlanta if possible!",NEGATIVE
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,J Clark,12/3/2024,"My wife and I, both senior citizens, arrived to the airport Wednesday, 11//27/24 around 825pm on Southwest Airlines flight. My wife required a wheelchair. There was a shortage of staff to assist with the wheelchair, therefore I offered to push the chair to pick up our baggage. While backing my wife into the tramway/train the doors closed on my wife's legs and would not reopen. Thankfully there were a couple of young male passengers who assisted me pry the doors open to free my wife before the train took off. As soon as we got my wife in, the doors closed and the train began to move, jerking and stopping several times before finally began to move at a normal pace. We were so nervous after this event it was hard to even continue to the baggage claim. Asked a few employees for directions and they were not very helpful. Finally one young lady employee was able to pointed us in the right direction. with a smile. One would think the train doors would have sensors that would open the doors if someone was trapped between them and would not allow them to close. I still have visions of what would have happened if my wife had gotten hurt or the train would have moved while my wife was trapped between the doors. To question #18 below, 'Would I recommend this airport"", what is one to reply? If this airport is a hub that people have to go through what are the options?",NEGATIVE
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,Sarah Land,11/10/2024,I travel a lot and have never experienced the rude disgusting treatment like the TSA Atlanta! When I tell you those women spoke so bad to us I was in disbelief! They get away with it because we are on limited time and can’t risk missing our flights. It’s so bad you want to come 8 hours early just so you have a moment to ask to speak to someone higher because it’s so bad they deserve to know the disrespect the travelers that help pay their salaries are just sick of it! I travel too much to be spoken to or watch other people be spoken to like dogs! Never in any airport in this country or outside of this country have I come across the sheer disrespect I have in Atlanta! If it were easier to drive to a whole other state to leave from I would. Who is their boss do they not monitor how their staff in TSA treats people? Does no one get trained in proper customer service?,NEGATIVE
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,Tess Penfold,11/6/2024,"We arrived at Atlanta airport from London Heathrow, there was a delay at Heathrow by a few hours, wasn't any customer service in place to ensure that we could catch our connecting flight to Mexico, instead we had to stand in long queues and when we asked the staff if they could help us connect our flight to Mexico they said ""get back in the queue!"" they wouldn't listen to us, we then thought we'd ask another member of staff received a similar response. We stood in the queue for ages missed our connecting flight. Delta were extremely helpful and provided a hotel and voucher for dinner and breakfast. As for immigration staff they were so unprofessional, unhelpful and refused to listen to our request for some support and advice to travel onto our connecting flight. There should have been clear communication between Virgin and Atlanta Airport to ensure that customers could progress onto their connecting flights, a service should have been implemented to ensure this happened effectively within immigration from planning to support from immigration staff. Looking at other reviews for Atlanta airport many well travelled people are saying it's one of their worst experiences, I would agree. Please support customers to connect to their flights and review your current systems as they don't work and offer training to immigration staff to help, advise instead of telling them to get back in the queue. Restaurant staff and service were excellent as were Delta however immigration staff whilst queueing were rude and unwelcoming.",NEGATIVE

Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,David Johnson,10/20/2024,"TSA was grossly understaffed with a single, slow, lethargic employee managing the only security check in station. I watched hundreds of flyers standby and watch their flight times pass by as the line stayed stagnant taking just over two hours to even get to baggage check. From an operational standpoint - Atlanta's airport should be momentarily shut down and reorganized. They need to up their headcount severely and while replacing operational leadership to more experienced individuals who are capable of getting security wait times below 2 hours. Truly an embarrassing organization where critical thinking goes to die. No other business or operation could survive with this leadership and conduct. Extremely horrible experience, please avoid this airport at all cost.",NEGATIVE
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,M Rose,10/12/2024,"Never flown before, but heard horror stories. We arrived at the airport with plenty of time to go through security. We got into line and we were 5 rows in . It was moving pretty good and then the line came to a complete holt !we then waited and waited, waited, mean while time was ticking and we watched the employees argue about they should do ! It seem to my husband and i like like no one knew what to do. Then as I put my stuff into the security containers I was yelled at to put everything in my hands in the container and I did, the tsa office said I needed another container so I did and waited for her to push my containers through she held mine backed four times on purpose and I knew this to be a fact because she took the container from people from behind me and kept holding my stuff back from going through the x ray machine. Now I have five minutes to go through the body x ray and run to the gate!! Then after we went through the x ray machine the tsa officer made me go through again!! Without any reason at all! After running to our gate we got there to find out that they hadn’t even loaded the plane. After standing trying to catch my breath from running.they announced that had to move to another gate and we weren’t going to depart until 9:30 pm. The worse experience ever!!",NEGATIVE
Auckland,airport,W Keale,2/13/2025,"My flight to Brisbane was scheduled to take off at 6:45 am, so I arrived at the airport at 5:00 am, checked in my bag real quick and in 5 minutes I was queuing for passport control, and because my passport is not one of the 10 privileged passports that are allowed to use the egates, we had to queue for 35 minutes, and we complete passport control we have to queue for security check at the same queue as everyone else. So if a US, Korean or New Zealand citizen arrives at the airport 45 minutes after I do, they will still be passing security check before I do, what kind of discrimination is this? At least we should have our own security queue. The suffering didn’t end there, we had to queue for 30 minutes in security control queue, and because I travel a lot for work, I knew the procedure, i took out my laptop from the bag, but, surprisingly, my tray was sent for manual checking, by the way, almost 50% of the bags went to manual check, that is another 15 minutes queue wait, and when it was my turn the inspector didn’t even touch the bag like what she did with the others, where she frisked all of them, she told me that I’m good and nothing is wrong here - why did you make me wait 15 minutes then? Full mess, slow staff, poor screening process. I have never seen such a horrible security and passport control queues than NZ airports Christchurch and Auckland",NEGATIVE
Auckland,airport,P Hayward,2/3/2025,"The worst international airport in the world. We arrived back in NZ after three years away to this mess and national embarrassment. The confusion starts after Customs at the bottom of stairs before baggage claim where two people are yelling at you to go two different ways based on if you are declaring something. The baggage claim belts are so close to the bio security lanes that there is no room to get bags. We then thought we were doing the right thing by declaring items (what a mistake). Waited nearly an hour for someone to put a sticker on passport then went into another queue and waited the same only to be put in a different queue again and cleared (same as if we hadn’t declared!) Overall it took us over 2 hrs after landing to clear the international terminal and we missed the bag drop time to our domestic flight so had to run with 6 suitcases to the domestic terminal and just caught our connecting flight by 5 minutes. Extremely stressful, disappointing, and frustrating from a frequent traveler who has seen how great other airports around the world n make it work. Auckland is the only airport I’ve been in where there is no priority or benefit associated with being a New Zealander for processing, it’s actually faster if you are not. Will avoid this airport wherever possible in the future for family or business travel.",NEGATIVE
Auckland,airport,L Keane,2/3/2025,"We flew into and out of Auckland Airport four times in the last month. Customs and baggage handling were superb. What is appalling is the transfer from the international terminal to the domestic terminal. A fifteen minute, not undercover, because the 'shuttle bus' operates only every 15 minutes and already 30 people with bags were waiting. We had 20 minutes before check-in at the domestic terminal. When we got there, we were told our domestic flight was 1.15 hours late but there is no signage at the international terminal about domestic flights. So, we thought we'd have a coffee/sandwich while waiting. Only the donut shop was open. We were among 200 or so waiting for flights between 6.30 and 9pm.",NEGATIVE

Auckland,airport,Roger Van der Zanden,10/20/2024,"Auckland Airport's management continue to demonstrate zero abilities to dream plan and execute a terminal building which provides a pleasant navigable environment for its users ie passengers. It lacks any sort of continuity from entering the precinct as a prospective passenger through to boarding aircraft. There is a complete absence of garden areas either internal or external, a complete absence of viewing areas either within the building or outside platforms. As an interface between passenger and plane all it offers is a confused mumbo jumbo of disparate poorly identified user portals shops and food outlets which come at the poor passenger like machine gun bullets! Management have completely failed to utilise any sort of imagination instead doing the most pathetic box ticking exercise ever. Makes me ashamed to be a Kiwi!",NEGATIVE
Auckland,airport,J Simpson,9/23/2024,"A disgrace. Arrived after 2 long haul flights and very tired.. An hour to get bags, another 1/2 hour through chaotic customs where the staff all seemed 1/2 asleep and barely out of their teens! Worse to come is transfer to domestic which was cutting it fine with such slow immigration. Couldn’t find bag drop which existed a few years ago so. Longish walk with bad knee to B bus stop which I was directed to by a staff member, (with all bags) for shuttle which didn’t come after 15 minutes so I walked all the way to domestic, no shelter for much of it and many bumps for luggage along the way. Barely any signposts or staff, and some signs in Māori that I couldn’t understand so imagine very confusing for international visitors. It’s time this airport and management improves as it’s been appalling for years now! An embarrassing gateway to New Zealand. The worst airport I’ve been in in many many years.",NEGATIVE

Austin,airport,T Hayne,10/24/2024,"I am well traveled, and I used to live in Austin. This airport was the worst airport experience I have ever had. Ever. There were so many people crammed into such a small space. I cannot believe that it wasn't some sort of hazard. If there had been an emergency, people would've been trampled to death. I was at my gate very early, two hours before my flight. Normally, this is a nice calming time for me after a vacation and before I have to head home. There were no seats or floor space to be had within three gates on either side of my gate. The crowds were too much for me to want to walk even further than that. I finally found space three gates down behind the garbage cans on the floor. The crowd never stopped for two hours. Planes would take off, but even more people would come. I didn't want to get up and go to the bathroom because I was afraid that I would lose my trashcan floor space. Then there is the live music. I love live music, I love that Austin Airport has live music. But couple that with an insane amount of people and a PA system that never stops speaking. It is recipe for someone to crack. I don't think I could ever explain enough how crazy the idea that they are operating this airport like this is.. Now let's get to the PA system, I don't know why people in the gates need to know that some dude has illegally parked his car out front. In theory, that guy shouldn't have gotten past security. I don't think I've ever been in the airport that announced that in the gates area. It never stopped. There was always some car out. front illegally parked. Then you had the airlines trying to announce departures and find passengers. It was complete insanity. Who runs an airport like this? Now onto the bottled water fillers, I tried two different ones, both were trickling so slow that I gave up and bought water. Change your clogged filters Austin. I don't think I'll ever fly into/out of this airport again. I definitely would not suggest anyone with sensory issues to come within 100 miles of this airport. My goodness Austin, what a huge disappointment",NEGATIVE

I have seen the airport grow and change over the years. The changes over the years have been for the better! Notable things about Austin-Bergstrom International (AUS): - there are two terminals the (main) Barbara Jordan terminal where all the restaurants, lounges and stores are, and the South Terminal currently Allegiant and Frontier Airlines. - there is a family viewing area outside the airport for watching planes and having a picnic. There are currently 4 lounges (AA, UA, DL and a Chase Sapphire Terrace) - there are many good places to eat including many local restaurants (my favorite are Taco Deli, Salt Lick BBQ, Second Bar + Kitchen, Annie's, and Juiceland. - it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end of the terminal to the other, along the way you will see lots of places to eat, drink and shop. Pros: clean, great dining, bars, and rest areas. The Delta lounge is the nicest lounge in the airport.

Avignon,airport,P Hartley,7/15/2008,A superb little airport - just one small building really. Not many major airlines fly to Avignon so there are only one or two plane loads of passengers in the airport at any time. Most of the time yours is the only large aeroplane and you are met at the door to the airport by friendly customs officers (most sporting superb Gallic moustaches!). You can see your luggage being loaded onto the carousel (very efficient) and the exit from the airport is less than 5 metres from the luggage hall. The three or so check-in desks seem efficient and all staff most accomodating. All in all a most friendly little airport that will hopefully avoid commercialisation that ravages its British counterparts.,POSITIVE
Ayers Rock,airport,J Teale,9/6/2024,"I was recently on a return flight from Uluru after four days at Sails in the Desert celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary. I am unable to proceed through regular screening as I have a cardiac loop recorder implanted in my left breast and have had a total right hip replacement. I indicated this when asked as I loaded my cabin luggage on the conveyor belt and was directed to the alternative screening process. I was screened with the usual procedure, then pat down. That’s expected. I could see my implant & prosthesis clearly on the screen. Then the young lady asked me to rub both hands back & forward in my groin - no idea why at this stage. Then my hands were scanned with a detector. “None detected” was the result on screen. It then occurred to me that I am being screened for secreting drugs in my private parts. The young lady then advises me that I need to proceed to a room for a personal body search. I must have looked quite incredulous as a senior officer came, pointed to the screen and advised the young lady that it was indeed a hip prosthesis and allowed me to proceed. I’m still traumatised and flabbergasted at such poor training. With 230,000 annual visitors to Uluru I find it beyond belief that this young lady has never seen what a hip replacement looks like on screen. My orthopaedic surgeon provided me with a certificate of proof of hip replacement but assured me that it wasn’t necessary for me to carry this when travelling due to the high numbers of passengers with hip and knee replacements and airport staff are very familiar with these prostheses. Needless to say that that experience certainly took away from the anniversary celebrations. Jetstar’s “complaints” procedure are so cumbersome and, I believe, designed to put you off. I made three attempts to notify Jetstar of such poor training but each time I had to wait to “speak” to an online chat bot - all three dropped out. Won’t be going back unfortunately, although it was a beautiful place which I hope I can look back, reflect on and enjoy after I get over this trauma.",NEGATIVE
Ayers Rock,airport,Alan Young,10/15/2023,"Flying back to Sydney from Ayers Rock / Yulara airport. On arrival expected it to be busy as two flights leaving close together. Check in - a bit of a wait. Then the fun started! Security queue long and moving at a snails pace. One scanning machine only which was bad enough, but every time a bag (or passenger) had to checked everything stopped dead. Lots of frustrated passengers. Saw a lady in a wheelchair having the underneath examined with a mirror on a stick. My wife swabbed for explosives, and elderly passengers having their luggage turned inside out by the security staff.

Previously it was next to the massive sandstone monolith known as Uluru or Ayers Rock. The old airport was on tribal sacred land and hence the relocation. The new airport is about 20 mins from the township of Yulura. It is a small airport taking in modern short-haul passenger jets. We arrived in good time but our flight was delayed by 60 minutes. The small terminal was getting crowded with passengers for other flights. There was not enough seating and many waiting passengers had to stand.

I arrived by domestic service (I understood some international flights do use this airport) so customs were negligible. The airport is built on the edge of the desert and is surrounded by picturesque desert panorama. Being tourist orientated all sorts of tourist services were available immediately upon retrieval of baggage.

Also after the security check there are no shops to buy cigarettes or food.,NEGATIVE
Bacau,airport,C Laurent,8/4/2022,"The new airport building looks great from far away. However outside there is no seating area/benches. The whole windows on the building are extremely dirty both from inside and outside. Once inside the airport there are no facilities to buy any food. Only a small Relay shop with some snacks. The check-in area feels very crammed, with the check-in desks extremely close to another. Security was fast, although once you pick up your try, there is no proper place where to put it, only some very low benches. Passport control was fast. Inside the boarding area there are 3 gates. Again very close to each other, with no clear indications. Not enough seating area for everyone, extremely crammed space. One small DF, one small bar and a vending machine, plus an indoor smoking area. Once boarding commenced, one announced was made indicating the gate, although on the gate screen the previous destination was not changed. On the tarmac at least a couple of people light up cigarettes and smoking and no one said anything. I thought this was quite dangerous especially as the aircraft was refuelling. As the Airport is new I was expecting a way better experience.",NEGATIVE
Bacau,airport,S Reynolds,12/22/2016,Bacau is the worst airport I've experienced (just arrived from Zanzibar so I know what an abandoned airport means). Don't even bother doing the online check-in as they only accept the ticket printed by the company. There's no info whatsoever and the security check is a joke. Don't bother arriving early as the security check only starts 1 hour before the departure time - it's all a mess. I honestly thought I wouldn't see anything worst after Africa. Upon arrival you have to wait outside in the freezing temperatures because there's no room for a full 737.,NEGATIVE
Bacau,airport,A Dron,7/20/2013,Probably the smallest airport I have experienced. On arrival distance between the entry doors from the apron to the immigration desks can not be more than 5 yards. This means that passengers have to queue outside which in inclement weather must be unpleasant. Passport checks were fast however. On departure similarly tiny landside area with minuscule cafe to left of entrance doors. Incredibly cramped check-in/security area to right of doors although check-in agent friendly and helpful. Security checks are very thorough - had to remove belt watch etc and they found small jar of jam I'd absent-mindedly packed in my carry-on bag. Departure lounge was standing room only for a single Boeing 737. Couple of vending machines are the only refreshment sources. Local people told us that a major expansion of the airport is planned but from look of abandoned foundations beside the existing terminal this is unlikely to be completed any time soon. In short staff seem fine but can not recommend because of lack of space and facilities - even allowing for the fact it's a regional airport not a major hub.,NEGATIVE
Bacolod–Silay,airport,4 reviewsB James,4/11/2020,"Airport with very basic amenities. Just like a lot of airports in the Philippines, Bacolod airport is serving beyond capacity and really needs some sort of expansion. Not enough check in counters to serve all the flights is serving. Also a fairly limited amount of food/drink outlets. Seating in departure area is also limited especially with some people choosing to place their bags in seats.",NEGATIVE
Bacolod–Silay,airport,13 reviewsMichael Mejia,6/22/2017,"Bacolod is a small regional airport in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines, which is a short 50 minute flight from MNL. Arrival is short and painless and even if I didn't check any luggage for this particular flight, baggage was out in the conveyor even after my disembarkation through a rather short airbridge. Departure was also pretty fast and straightforward. The waiting area, however, was crowded, hot and dirty. Very few options outside of the very basic business class lounge to sit, eat or have a drink.",NEGATIVE
Bagdogra,airport,Ladenla Lama,1/1/2025,"The airport is very poorly managed. Huge traffic at the airport but the infrastructure is very very poor. There are no places for the passengers to sit.

And the cleaning staffs were also not present.",NEGATIVE
Bagdogra,airport,Amullya Rai,3/13/2021,The worst airport I've ever been to. Small and always crowded. Limited amenities and a hassle to go through the security check. But scratch all that cause that is not the actual reason why this airport sucks the posterior like an industrial grade vacuum pump drawing water in the centre of the Sahara desert during the hottest day of a drought caused by divine retribution. The reason why this airport is totally annoying is because the ground staff have no idea how to provide service. No clue whatsoever. It's as if these airline companies purposefully choose their worst dolts to represent them in the most unprofessional way possible. They think of themselves as some celebrities who are entitled to your subservience since they work at the airport. It's like a really really bad joke. You wonder what is going on in the their minds while the try their utmost to make your life harder in whatever way possible. I despise having to use this airport but I have no choice since it's the closest one from where I live. Travellers flying to this airport won't really smell the proverbial but travellers flying from this airport be ready to get a face full of it.,NEGATIVE
Bagdogra,airport,1 reviewsAnna Whyte,3/30/2019,"I have nightmares about this airport. To call it an international airport is a bad joke. I flew through 2 times in March, the first to take the helicopter service to Gangtok. The 2nd to fly back to Delhi T3 with Vistara, accompanied by my 20 year old son. I have a traumatic brain injury which means, essentially, that I am extremely sensitive to noise and crowds. Most airports have facilities that support this, 1st class check in, fast track security and lounges. Bagdogra ""International"" Airport has none of these facilities. Last year, before Vistara flew to Bagdogra I flew Air India and managed to ask other passengers to help me through security and then sat on the floor in a corner facing the wall for 2 hours shaking with sound cancelling headphones. Then didn't leave my hotel in Delhi for 2 days as I had to recover. 2019: Trip 1 in March with the helicopter to Gangtok: The staff pushed us to the front of the totally chaotic security queue. There were not enough boxes so the security staff were just dumping everyone's hand luggage/laptops/mobiles/electrical items in big piles and throwing the boxes back at each other. My son reported that a passenger was hit in the head by a badly aimed box. As we had only 2 women passengers for the helicopter and a person helping us, we managed. 2nd time: Bagdogra-Delhi Vistara. I had a panic attack outside the terminal and luckily we were flying Vistara as we were seated in the managers office until final call and then escorted through security by the professional Vistara staff. The staff at this airport are the most unprofessional I have encountered in 30+ years of travelling. While I was vomiting outside the terminal (in a trash can) from a panic attack a security guard with ""trainee"" on his jacket threatened to remove me until the police intervened and sent him away. My hand luggage, a computer bag with laptop and camera was forcibly removed from me by the guy X-raying hand luggage as he said it was too heavy. By this time, my son took over and the Vistara staff took me to the managers office as I was shaking and had Aphasia. My bag weighed 8 kilos (I have luggage weights) and I had a 10 kilo hand luggage allowance. I could go on. This airport is noisy, horrible and disorganised. Departing passengers sit on the floor waiting for their flights as there are not enough hard metal seats. Security is a nightmare (Watch out for flying plastic boxes). The staff x-raying the bags have no idea what they are doing. As I have a disability, I always fly a premium airline, now Vistara, so unfortunately, there is no alternative if you go to Sikkim. I feel sorry for the competent airline staff who work in this sorry excuse for an airport. Thank you Vistara Airline for your professional help in what must be an awful working environment.",NEGATIVE
Bagdogra,airport,C Karan,10/22/2018,"This is pretty much the worst airport you could travel from. It is downright pathetic in almost all categories. Poor road, poor drop off and parking area. Absolutely insufficient place in the departure area for the amount of people with archaic processes of manual baggage screening. Appalling and small area for security check. The security hold area is so small that it's always crowded, bursting at the seams with unhygienic and smelly surrounding. Won't even talk about the washrooms but you can guess. Sadly for almost everyone within a 100km radius it's the only airport for connectivity so no choice hence authorities can get away with it.",NEGATIVE
Bagdogra,airport,Paul Harvey,7/20/2013,This is an old military airport which has only a few daily flights. It has a 'restaurant' and a souvenir shop (selling souvenirs you are unlikely to want). Security is tight and photographs are not allowed. My bag weighed more upon leaving than arriving and the only way to resolve this problem was to quietly pay a bribe less than the excess baggage cost. The toilets were smelly the seating areas both landside and airside were sufficient for the number of passengers using the two gates. The airport is totally disability unfriendly. There is parking nearby for more cars than the number of passengers likely to use the airport. It is close to the centre of town.,NEGATIVE
Baghdad,airport,D Stanley,1/18/2018,"Baghdad airport is OK. It works without too much hassle. It is a reasonably modern building. There are 3 linked terminals which you can easily walk between both airside and landside. There is a restaurant landside and small cafes both sides. Capacity is limited airside though. Usual facilities landside - mobile phone companies, ATM's, exchange etc. If you have a long transit, it is better to stay landside and visit the restaurant. There are moderate queues for security and immigration can be a bit slow. If you are not on Iraqi Airways, there may not be any business lounge available (certainly not for Turkish anyway).",NEUTRAL
Baghdad,airport,A Salter,1/7/2018,"As a frequent traveller, I can safely say that my recent experience at this airport is hands down the worst thing I've ever experienced at any airport. The body search officer (female) was unable to communicate that she wanted 3 women inside the search area, at the same time, obviously I had no idea that's what she wanted because nothing like that has ever happened before. You call one woman inside, get one done and then the other one enters the cubicle. She pulled me inside, checked two other women in front of me and then it was my turn. This was definitely not normal behaviour. Extremely disgusted and upset. This was my fifth visit to Baghdad and the first time anything like this has ever happened. The rest of the staff was fine but because the unacceptable behaviour of this woman compels me to give the staff a low rating.",NEGATIVE
Baghdad,airport,M Ziaebrahimi,8/14/2010,Arrived from Tehran by MahanAir around noon at Baghdad airport (BGW) for the second time. Arrival hall quite warm maybe 34 degrees centigrade outside was about 46 degrees immigration is not so fast but working. Toilets are grim you can find shops and exchange services around as well as small shops for some drink or snacks. Internet cafe is available and not so expensive. You have to use special busses or cars to leave the airport terminal. these cars will ask for USD15 and will not take you to the city of Baghdad but to a hot dusty open area where you can take a taxi. departing to Tehran from Baghdad airport was very time consuming due to severe security measures in Baghdad. You have to leave your hotel at least 5 hours before your departure time. Again you have to use special cars or buses and the same rate would be charged. before reaching at terminal you have to pass through 4 security check points where all baggage and passports would be checked. they use dogs for baggage. It was about 50 degrees centigrade and we had to wait under sunlight for 30 minutes for last checkpoint before entering the terminal. Another two x- rays inside terminal before check-in area. Check in was fast passport control was OK and the transit hall was much better than arrival hall enough seats good air conditioned and peaceful place with some shops and restaurants. Due to severe security measures in Iraq and specially in Baghdad you have to take special cars 4 hours before your departure time due to unpredicted delays and interruption which may happen in check points. Anyway the Baghdad airport service is much better and improved comparing two years ago that used it for first time.,NEUTRAL
Bahrain,airport,Tony Williams,6/3/2024,"I enjoyed 2 lengthy stop overs here on a recent flight to BKK in Biz class with Gulf Air. The airport is amazing, clean, and transit was smooth.

Bahrain,airport,Vijayakumar Ravindaran,9/26/2023,"Positive experience is Airport is clean. Pathetic Hospitality service providing by the Airport staffs, they are not understanding that they are for passengers. Security check for 400 passengers single queue no one there to help the old people and expecting them to stand in the queue for 45 minutes. Staffs attitude is very bad especially when they are directing the passengers they are using unprofessional hand signals. Smile with the customer understand the need.",NEGATIVE
Bahrain,airport,A Kaleel,4/28/2023,"Bahrain's new airport has given me a satisfying experience as I found the place really simple, big enough, and neat. I must say that it seemed also like a plane-spotters paradise since they have these huge glass windows that gives an almost unobstructed view by gate area, and also a rooftop experience from The Terrace. In my point of view, the only downside is the limited Internet and when you have not enough money to spend for food. I'm also glad that the playroom at the bottom of their huge, central LED screen is free for everyone to enjoy and wheelchair accessible as well which is absolutely a big plus. Also, the airport didn't seem too crowded and I hope it stays that way.",POSITIVE
Bahrain,airport,3 reviewsC Han,2/19/2023,"The terminal offers an array of restaurants and shops, which gives passengers a well rounded experience. The security was smooth and quick with just only a few passengers waiting in line. The airport has a very white theme which makes the interior very bright. Staff at the airport are generally helpful and able to speak basic to intermediate level of English. I had troubles connecting to the WiFi network. I asked the airport staffs to help me out because they couldn't figure out the reason of not being able to connect the WiFi.  All in all, Bahrain Airport is one of the nicest airports to travel in addition to Doha and Muscat Airports.",POSITIVE
Bahrain,airport,A Zubairi,2/2/2023,Really beautiful airport after the renovations. All major fast food places available apart from local cuisine. Wifi is free and fast regardless of duration of the connection which is a huge plus. Coffee shop was slightly expensive but the food and coffee were fine nonetheless. The announcements are a big plus since most airports in the region are switching to quite airports.,POSITIVE
Bahrain,airport,6 reviewsMohamed Alkowari,11/24/2022,The Airport was quiet and everything went really smooth.

The wifi was also very reliable.,POSITIVE
Bahrain,airport,6 reviewsMohamed Alkowari,10/29/2022,The Airport is clean and well put together. Food options have increased after adding KFC and TGI Friday's alongside Burger King. The guy at the check-in counter gave us a hard time because he kept enquiring about our Singapore Visas (even though for Bahrainis going to Singapore there is a Visa on Arrival) and I kept telling him that I’d been to Singapore 4 times already and I’d never had to apply for a pre-departure Visa but he kept asking his colleagues about it.  The staff at the Pearl Lounge were friendly and I loved the free Evian Bottles.,POSITIVE
Bahrain,airport,6 reviewsMohamed Alkowari,7/13/2022,"As a Bahraini I’m really proud of this airport. Very neat and clean facilities and very well organized with easy signage and boarding procedures. Toilets are super clean and well attended. Some cons I would give are a lack of food options and the service at check in counters can be a little slow. Additionally, I wish there was a Marhaba lounge that allowed access to non-Amex credit card holders as well. Other than that, bravo.",POSITIVE
Baku,airport,45 reviewsDiogo Freitas,1/27/2024,I paid 7 times more the normal rate to go from this airport to the city center. There are no ATMs on arrivals nor SIM cards shops. Your option is to accept the rides from the men who pest the arrivals area. They even have electronic terminals inside their taxis for you to pay by card their immensely overpriced rides. They are very well organized. Be very careful and smarter than me. Arrive with money of the country and call a Bolt or Uber by connecting to the airport WiFi.,NEGATIVE
Baku,airport,S Sher,6/22/2021,"I had a few issues with this airport. The first issue was as soon as I entered the terminal after the initial security check. They had 4 hands-free sanitizer dispensers right on the other side of security and not a single one of them worked. I asked the security guard about it and he just shrugged and said they don't work. Thankfully I carry my own hand sanitizer with me wherever I go so I was able to sanitize my hands. After that I went to check in for my flight. I had extra baggage fees that I needed to pay, which I already anticipated. They have one location that you pay for all excess baggage fees. They were working extremely slowly and they were not able to accept an international VISA, MasterCard, or Discover Card. All of them had travel plans on the cards so it had nothing to do on my side. They only accepted credit cards local to Azerbaijan. For being an international airport, this should be an option to pay with an international credit card. Then, as I looked for more sanitizer stations, they had many posted throughout the airport. I found at least 8 more after I went through security. Not a single on worked. During COVID, this should be one of the priority items to help minimize the spread of COVID at an International airport. They did not have a single working sanitizer dispenser in the entire airport. Then, because of the issue with them taking so long to pay for the extra baggage fees, I needed to quickly get to my departing gate because they didn't open the check-in process until two hours before departure instead of the three hours for an international flight that they are supposed to. I went to the security check I was accustomed to use and I was then told after I got up there that that security checkpoint was not open and I had to enter through the other side of the airport. There were zero signs showing that the security checkpoint was closed. Normally this wouldn't be so big of an issue, but because of the delays with paying for the extra baggage, the plane had already started boarding and I didn't have much time. My family and I had to run to the other side of the airport to go through the other security. This airport is not very large, but it still takes a little time to get from one side to the other, especially when you are already late because of delays that were beyond our control. We were at the airport four hours early and almost missed our flight because of all of these combined issues that were out of our control, the security being shut down without notice, the excessive delays with the baggage, and them opening up check in 2 hours before flight departure instead of 3 that is stated. This was a very frustrating and bad experience at the airport and much of it would have been eliminated if they just had these things in place that are common sense.",NEGATIVE
Baku,airport,Zeeshan Shah,12/27/2019,My first visit to Baku Heydar Aliyev Airport and was pleasantly surprised in many ways and disappointed in a few others. The airport has very striking architecture and is not very large but easy to navigate. The design is very interesting as it has three levels with the departure level on the this floor. The number of high end shops at an international airport of this size surprised me. The airport is about 20 minutes to 25 minutes from downtown Baku by car. They do have a bus service and plans to extend the Baku Metro to the airport sometime in the future. Now for the disappointing parts. It took quite some time for the luggage to arrive at the carousel at 2:00 am even though my flight was the only one at the airport. Also immigration coming and going took an inordinate amount of time with someone with an American passport. In some ways it looked like they had not even seen an American passport before! And the security check leaving was very overzealous bordering on Soviet like. They confiscated my luggage scale from my carry on even though I protested that it was went through American security!,NEGATIVE
Baku,airport,Loay Osman,11/3/2019,"Was very impressed with the airport, on arrival visa process was so smooth and was done in few seconds and the staff were friendly and smiling on departure.

I’m not sure about the public transportation as I had my pick up and drop off arranged by my Hôtel. Overall it’s a nice airport.",POSITIVE
Baku,airport,B Cooper,10/3/2019,"The airport is clean and looks great. However, it is let down badly by the circus that you have to put up with if you are a transit passenger who needs to pick up a boarding pass on arrival. I had a 3.5 hour layover in GYD traveling back from Aktau. The staff could not/would not print me off a boarding pass until 1.5 hours before my connection, leaving me stranded in a holding room. I had booked with AZAL, but because it was a codeshare with Turkish Airlines, this made them less helpful! The airport really needs to get with the times and move the check-in area into the main airport transit area. It makes zero sense preventing people from accessing this area and stinks of a computer says no attitude.",NEGATIVE

Ballina Byron,airport,B Lewis,9/12/2023,"Very small airport, like a bus station. Arriving via stairs from the aircraft for all. Just one baggage belt for the two arrival planes made the area overcrowded and it took longer than expected. Departure, well counters are open two hours prior with a seating area to wait but nothing else. Security was awful. The old fashioned take everything out type plus my knee showed an anomaly so got the full pat down. As did every other elderly woman. Anyway, there is a coffee/snack shop and newsagents in departures. There was not enough terminal seating for the two flights departing. Lining for boarding was hard as the area is so small, the line ups went through the café. Its time to expand.",NEGATIVE
Ballina Byron,airport,G Bray,6/6/2015,This is a small domestic airport that has outgrown it's small terminal by a long way. It strains to handle anything more than two aircraft at a time. When I arrived there were 3 planes trying to be turned around in the same hour. Arriving passengers packed out the baggage hall with their friends and relatives while departing passengers filled up every other space in the airport. The queue through security went out the terminal door resulting in some passengers mistaking this as a line for check in and missing the check in cut off time limit but thankfully airport staff allowed them to still check in with the chaos. Beyond the single security point it was standing room only. With only two gates side by side more confusion occurred at people lined up for the wrong aircraft because of snaking lines in the small space. A new terminal which is planned but not going to be built for some time it can not come quick enough.,NEGATIVE
Ballina Byron,airport,C Tudehope,7/15/2010,For the number of passengers it handles the Ballina-Byron airport really isn't that big. For most of the day it's fairly quiet with REX operating its 36 seaters 3 times per day. However within a 2 hour timeframe both Virgin and Jetstar operate their 180-seaters into and out of the airport which causes it to almost reach breaking point. The departure lounge isn't in any way big enough to cater for a full flight and the ventilation leaves a bit to be desired. The ground crew from all airlines were friendly enough and the cafe wasn't too bad. However when comparing Ballina the second largest market out of Sydney to other regional airports like Albury Dubbo Newcastle and Canberra it really is sub-par. It needs freshening up made more open and indeed made bigger to cater for any future growth that may come about! It gets the job done-but it's nothing special-and definitely isn't inviting.,NEUTRAL
Baltimore Washington,airport,C Horten,8/30/2024,"This is the second time I write about this airport. Last time it was about TSA and this time this passenger passed through quickly without any delay to to my disability. However when the plane touched down after a day of travel this passenger decided to wait at the aiport overnight. Well, after overnighting at the SFO, I thought this would be just an ordinary thing. However my night at Baltimore Washington Airport was so miserable that I must record several warnings. 1) All the eateries and cafes are closed by 11pm 2) The workers are about as friendly and responsible as formerly at greyhound 3) hourly wage mentality prevalent, so whatever is not spelled out in the handbook is okay, including for instance having ground crew workers on break purposely sitting by visitor repeatedly. 4) actually the supervision is so loose that the people going in and out of gate doors to the tarmac/cargo holding area can be wearing any ID. The guy that was eying me at Terminal C had an ID badge but he was taking a lot more breaks than a job allows. 5) all the workers seem to take a lot of breaks and sit around throughout the terminals talking, even socializing like at Terminal A. 6) At terminal C, while I was quietly sitting and napping the red-alarm bell on the ceiling at the gate went off ""by itself' several times. It also did that at the gate across where I was sitting. The alarm went on-and-off ""by itself"" four times at least, and each time, when I was sort of dozing off. I had commented to myself that the music was objectionable, and they ""changed the music to soft jazz."" So evidently the security was looking and listening to me throughout my stay, since obviously very few passengers stay here during the early morning hours. 6) When I walked to Terminal A (where I hoped there would be no alarms) the security speaker announced my last name and terminal location and that security was ""on it."" So apparently even though I am an older disabled person with no record or history of vagrancy or crime, the airport security were ""alert to my whereabouts"" to the point of announcing my last name and location so all the workers could hear. 7) At Terminal A, another ground crew again tried again to sit nearby during his ""break."" When I sort of had enough of this and was muttering to myself, that evidently was shared with some cleaning staff, and two burly janitors (twins) who were heading to clean one of the men bathrooms in Terminal A loudly and repeatedly jeered at me. ""Why does she have to keep moving around that ch*nk as if they was after her?"" that kind of thing. 8) At Terminal B it was quieter because by 4am I found of group of nonwhites who were sitting in a section. However again, another ID-badge worker tried to sit near by while I was napping. 9) Workers were also resting or napping in the food-hall area. As a consequence even though the food-halls and other shops look very attractive, I will not have any desire to eat here. 10) The nice thing about this was that while there were no formal guards questioning anyone, there are apparently enough ""night crew"" who keep going in and out of gate-doors (plus the other hidden cameras and mics) that they don't need them. The strange thing is it was hard to tell who was actually a hired worker and a part-timer with a badge who just sits around and tries to harass visitors. This is obviously why unlike at the SFO or LAX nobody wants to overnight here, period.",NEGATIVE

My daughter had difficulty locating her car and had gotten on the wrong airport bus. Now normally this is frustrating for anyone, but my daughter is autistic so trying to problem solve while in a heightened emotional state is a big struggle for her. Morgan is higher functioning and prides herself on how independent she is, but after a night of flying across country and running to connection flights, she was feeling defeated and concerned about finding her vehicle as the sun was going down. A bus driver named Chris on bus 407 was her guardian angel. He went out of his way to get her to the correct bus before it got dark when the main office confirmed they were too swamped to assist. He even had to deal with an angry traveler yelling at him for taking the extra time of getting Morgan to the correct bus connection although Morgan said he was very efficient and quickly navigated her to the correct destination.

Baltimore Washington,airport,S Kaylen,12/29/2023,"After arriving at BWI Airport around 5 PM from Detroit, I had to wait for two hours after touchdown for the handlers to begin bringing out the luggage and my suitcase was not among those that arrived. Upon enquiry at the Lost Luggage room, I was told that the plane was too heavy, so my suitcase (which was not anywhere near being overweight) had been randomly selected to be rerouted (thrown off the plane) to another airport. It would therefore now arrive at 10 PM from Chicago Midway. So I was given two choices: wait at the airport till 10 PM for my bag to arrive, or go home and wait ""two days"" for them to ""Overnight"" the bag to me via FedEX.  Really, how much extra fuel would it take for my normal-weight suitcase to be included in the original flight? I opted for the former option and prepared to settle in for a three-hour vigil at the BWI airport. At 10 PM I was at the conveyor belt that ground staff said I should stand at to wait for my suitcases. They said the plane would be 12 minutes late. And so I waited. Eventually another showed up. She was there to pick up her elderly mother who was on that plane from Chicago. She expressed concern as it was the first time her mother was flying using a walker. I would periodically check with ground crew if I was really standing at the right place. They always replied with the same thing: when the suitcases start arriving from Chicago they would be at belt 3. But it wasn't until well after 11 PM that I saw the belt I should be standing it was now Belt 4. The ground crew had not bothered to tell me about the change, even though I was standing near their desk and in regular conversation with them. The bags started rolling in and by 11:43 PM I was finally able to retrieve my suitcase. When I questioned the ground crew about the delay, they were very defensive and said that it wasn't as late as I thought because it took a long time for the plane to reach a gate, and they count the delay from the moment it does so. So there you are. This was my unplanned adventure on December 27. I hope your experience with Southwest Airlines and the BWI Airport is better than mine has been of late.",NEGATIVE

Baltimore Washington,airport,Z Crawford,1/21/2023,"The staff at security were very rude. I passed the security guy my passport then he mumbled something I didn’t hear. He then shouted at me to put my phone on the scanner to scan my ticket. Then I was about to walk through the security gate and one security worker was shouting in an irritated tone “push your bags through the scanner!” And as I was doing that she proceeded to shout it two more times. I heard her the first time. After that she said to her coworker “I don’t know how many times I have to say it” and her coworker said “yeah must’ve been about 4 times. I’ve stopped because nobody listens” They’re so disrespectful! Security is already overwhelming enough, especially for people with autism, anxiety etc. the first guy literally mumbled then yelled at me when I didn’t hear him. What if I had a hearing problem? The security workers need to have more respect and patience for others. The staff at Starbucks and auntie Anne’s however I didn’t have an issue with and for the most part were polite.",NEGATIVE

Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,B Lee,6/24/2019,"I arrived in this airport for transit. My destination is Bangkok, Thailand. In my opinion, the airport is quite small and kind of boring especially if you have a layover for more than 2 hours. There should have been some facilities that make the airport more interesting for example a reading corner, some cool spots for taking a picture, fun games, and more cafes or restaurants. The good thing is it's easy to follow the signs or directions and you don't have to walk that far to reach the gate, transit area, departure or arrival hall. So, it would be a great idea to make this airport bigger and larger with more facilities.",NEUTRAL
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,Mike Rowe,1/15/2019,"A small but tidy airport, adequate for short transits. The security/x-ray procedures for transit can be time consuming if more than one flight arrives at once. Expect an hour of queueing to get through the security. If you have a short connection staff will call you out of the normal queue just in time for your flight. For longer transits there is nothing to do in the airport and little food. The only coffee shop airside was closed in December. A transit visa is available on arrival (for AU) and costs $BN5. Money exchange is near the immigration area and easy. Meter taxis are supposed to be available but on my 10pm arrival none were available, unmetered all charge $BN20 for even the shortest trip. On my return the next morning the hotel booked me a car for $20. Overall a transit stop in a budget hotel adds $AU100 to your trip. Unfortunately the new schedule with Royal Brunei (since Oct 18) now require long stopovers and overnight transit in Brunei when connecting to SEA destinations and this now makes other more expensive airlines a more attractive option. ""Dry"" flights and inconsistent alcohol rules may also influence travellers. Immigration staff are slow, poorly organized and lazy, Visa stamps tend to take up a full passport page where they could use only a third like other countries. This trip was 50 minutes waiting at immigration. Business Class lounge is quiet and comfortable for short stops. Has shower facilities but nowhere to sleep. Food is hit and miss depending on time of day and number of guests. No alcohol in the lounge. An airport to be tolerated rather than enjoyed. Singapore/Kuala Lumper/Bangkok are all far better options.",NEGATIVE
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,A Makki,8/27/2018,"The airport is much better now since the renovation is complete. Plenty of parking when you arrive. There are a range of shops (Patchi chocolate, Bookstore, Coffee bean tea leaf, bodyshop) in the pre-departure area and a restaurant. There are ATM machines, a baggage sealing service and currency exchange stand (but they never have Singapore dollars). Check in was a breeze, done in several minutes. Passport control is quick. Once you enter the departure lounge, to the right is a food court that sells food to order (manly Asian dishes). There is a convenience store, some stores that sell traditional Bruneian foods and watch / perfume stores. I was told more stores will be added soon. The waiting area has good lighting, there are priority seats near the gate for those with young children and elderly people. The toilets were clean. There is a prayer room for Muslim travellers. On arrival there is a short walk to customs and immigration. Separate counters for local, ASEAN, Diplomatic and foreigners. There are plenty of trolleys at the baggage carousel. There is a green and red channel, there are several officers always on duty. I left a hand luggage on the plane, luckily I was able to retrieve it. There is a door at the side of KFC which leads back to the arrivals hall. The bag was aleady in the office for me to collect. In the arrivals hall there is a KFC and Burger King, also Counters for DST and Progressif which are the mobile phone carriers. You can purchase tourist sim cards which have minutes and data pre loaded. There is a counter for tourist information and Hertz / Avis car rental. Upon exiting the terminal there is a taxi service, taxis are metered. You can also use the ride hailing app Dart. There is a local bus service, but it's not available for the late flights. If you have a long layover and and your passport lets you exit the airport, the Airport mall is a 5 minute drive or 15 minute walk away, (but but be careful as there are no footpaths.)",POSITIVE
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,1 reviewsT Maloof,7/20/2018,"Landed in Brunei from Melbourne on my way to Dubai using RBA. Change between terminals is so easy, 20 minutes from the plane to the departure lounge, so no issues at all. Food selection is very limited and basic, it would be nice if they added more food options other than the Cafeteria on the 1st floor. Shopping is so limited, great for my wallet. Smoking room was under maintenance, so I couldn't smoke, bathroom was perfect though. The staff are very friendly over all, I believe this airport will be perfect if just a little extra is made. Love to go there again in September.",POSITIVE
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,B Lewis,2/2/2018,"Transiting here despite a short interval of one hour between flights was easy. It’s been revamped since last visit and has a lovely new feel. The signage was excellent. We had to go through security despite having just alighted however that was fast and easy. Our next gate was not far away to walk. The toilets were in good condition. Return transit turned out to be longer as our plane was delayed 14 hours and we had to enter the country. Again this was done quickly and efficiently, I have no complaints at all. Departing was just as easy although being such a small airport there is not much to do or see there - bring your own book/entertainment. All in all a good experience with this small but efficient airport.",POSITIVE
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,V Jackson,11/15/2017,"I expected much worse of Brunei airport after reading some of the reviews here. In fact, although small, I found it large enough not to be claustrophobic, with clean and spacious toilet facilities, and mercifully adequately air conditioned. Not many shopping or eating options, but how much do you really need on a short layover? The staff seemed engaged and friendly. Before flying I consulted the government's website for the airport, but it was pretty poor - the site was very so old-fashioned and extremely short on useful information. There were more details from passenger forums.",NEGATIVE
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,P Martin,7/5/2017,"Delays, expensive, negligent, rude, unhelpful. Partner and I were flying Royal Brunei to KK (Kota Kinabalu) from Melbourne, our total transit time was 1 hr and 45 minutes. However upon arrival we find our 45 minute flight was delayed 5 hours. That's 5 hours from 7pm to just after midnight in an airport where it is impossible to get any kind of fresh food. 1 convenience store serving instant noodles, and 1 cafe that had stale pastries and day old meat pastas. Being a vegetarian there was nothing I could eat, apart from 2 minute noodles from the airport 'convenience' store. On our way back, I made the mistake of buying 2 bottles of whisky (both gifts) from KK International airport. The duty free attendant, despite taking note of my boarding pass into Brunei, did not mention anything about alcohol confiscation in Brunei. (I thought being sealed in Duty free packaging would be fine). However, as we passed customs to transit for 1 hour, the two bottles were confiscated, with not so much as a 'Sorry'. Instead the service woman smiled rather rudely and asked for our baggage tag that was given to us upon check in at KK airport from Royal Brunei airlines. Instead of taking time to explain why I had just lost over $150 AUD worth of goods, she instead just told me to read the tiny piece of paper that was stapled under the baggage tag. It read: ""All items in excess of 100 ml will be confiscated in Brunei, regardless of whether the items are purchased duty-free from another airport or packed in tamper-evident bags. Please note that no airline shall be held responsible for confiscated items."" I could not find this information anywhere on the Australian customs/border control website. At the duty free shop in KK I was not warned, at check in, the Royal Brunei clerk clearly said 'Here are your baggage tags', not 'Here are your baggage tags, and important information regarding carrying alcohol into Australia, since you are transitting Brunei'. Morale of the long story. Read every piece of paper you are given by airport and airline staff, no matter how small. And when stopping in Brunei airport, take no chances with your duty free liquor, or it is good bye money.",NEGATIVE
Bandung,airport,Imran Ahmad,1/7/2020,"I was quite shocked by the lack of immigration checks and also the crowd at the airport. It was a hassle to retrieve our luggage as there was only one baggage track at arrival. There is also a lack of shopping choices and amenities airside but the items were so expensive, more than twice the price in Malaysia or other places even though the rupiah is cheaper than ringgit. But I'm pleased with the fast internet connection and the free computer services.",POSITIVE
Bandung,airport,F Lakana,9/26/2019,"Bandung Airport is a quaint airport in the middle of the city (used to be the HQ of. Indonesia’s domestic aircraft industry, meanwhile non-existing). It served a number of domestic and international destinations and was a real asset to the city. Then the government decided to build a grand new airport in Majalenka, about 60 or so kilometres north of Bandung, which had to cater for a growing population in the Bandung area and East Jakarta. It was opened pretty much on schedule, which is rare in Indonesia, but in the middle of nowhere; far away from current populations and with poor connections. Since no airlines wanted to move there, the government forced the move of 56 domestic flights from Bandung to the new Kertajati airport. This included the popular Bandung- Bali routes. The result is that it now takes longer to get to the new airport (about 3 hours), than it actually takes to fly to Bali. Some people now prefer to drive all the way to Jakarta, for more choice and cheaper flights. Efforts are made to reinstate some domestic flights in Bandung, but that does not include the Bali route for the time being. Overall, such a shortsighted decision to move all these flights from Bandung to Majalenka.:. So; for as long as Bandung Airport remains an ‘empty shell’ in terms of domestic flights, I will have to give it a low rating.",NEGATIVE
Bandung,airport,Henri Bemelmans,5/20/2018,The new airport is much better than the old but the issue with taxis remains. The military controls the airport and hence which taxis are used. No meters and extortionate fares. Better off walking 5 minutes south on road outside arrivals (right angle to airport terminal) and pickup a bluebird or AA cab from there. Clean and metered. Pity the Government does not stop in and do something about this as it is a horrible welcome to what is otherwise a friendly and interesting city and region.,NEGATIVE
Bandung,airport,Julio Giovan Damanik,10/29/2016,"The new Bandung airport terminal is very different to the old terminal. Cleaner, more space, more shops, and more toilets.

Overall, good but could use more luggage belts in the arrival terminal and more parking spaces.",POSITIVE
Bandung,airport,10 reviewsDexter Lee,10/8/2016,"I've come across old reviews of Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and I have to say that the airport today doesn't look as bad as it used to be. The new terminal building is a welcome addition for an airport that handles nearly 90 flights a day. There is a security check for both international and domestic passengers before the check-in, and another one at the entrances to the international and domestic departure halls. Checks were quick and cleared the immigration checkpoint in less than a minute. Apparently most of the shops after the security area are in the domestic departure hall. The new international departure hall consists of only one gate (Gate 3i), a tiny magazine stand, a kids playground and a food kiosk that looks more like a mini warehouse. There is free wi-fi to keep people occupied, charging points for mobile phones, as well as plenty of seats. Since there are few international flights the international departure area doesn't feel crowded. As the airport is tiny there are no aerobridges, so you have to walk to the plane rain or shine. While this can be annoying for some, it is pretty great for aviation enthusiasts (you can get really close to planes that are taxiing to the runway). Would be happy to use Bandung Airport again.",POSITIVE
Bandung,airport,Aldo Samulo,7/20/2013,Husein Sastranegara Airport in Bandung West Java Indonesia is very small and very narrow and does not deserve to be an international airport. Besides smaller and less clean toilets. The most severe and the entrance to the airport is very small and so is the waiting room is very small and result in chaos when passengers crowded. Besides the entrance to the plane and the stairs are very narrow so it is difficult to walk and the airport are very uncomfortable.,NEGATIVE
Baneasa,airport,A Wild,8/17/2011,Returned from a short break in Romania. On arrival you are forced to queue in a small hot dirty room to pass through security. You walk into the baggage collection which consists of a small room with the smallest conveyor belt of any airport I've seen. Once you have retrieved your luggage you walk past a small desk which I think was customs you are then outside and ready to be hassled by numerous dodgy taxi drivers. When departing from Baneasa ensure you arrive early as the queues are appalling. Our flight had 2 check-in desks but only one was open. Long queues to get through security before the departure lounge. There are 4 doors onto the runway and 3 or 4 screens which are impossible to read. There is a small shop in the lounge although it doesn't accept Romanian currency. Small cafe and a smoking room that holds 6-8 people standing. Didn't see a cleaner during my 3 hours in the airport and it shows.,NEGATIVE
Baneasa,airport,N Gagnebin,9/1/2010,"The Airport didn't have someone who could speak English at the information desk. The ""info- desk"" should really employ someone being able to understand and speak English as most of destinations are outside Romania and the traveling language in Europe is actually English. The Airport has no possibility to buy and stamps so if you intend to write postcards and buy the stamps at the Airport forget it. The organisation is quite awful. The 3 queue lines are clearly written but besides having a queue for Crew the non-EU isn't really useful as all planes leaves for a Eu destination. It's small and the boarding gates are not clearly shown. You must figure out by yourself if the bus you just popped in will actually bring you to the correct plane on the tarmac!",NEGATIVE
Baneasa,airport,Daniel Nunes,7/17/2010,I use this airport quite frequently. The airport has only 2 rooms - One where are located all the waiting places information booths and about 8 check-ins. The other room the boarding room is not much bigger and has 4 gates and no information whatsoever you just have to figure out for yourself which one is your gate. Overcrowded filthy and dangerous due the the large amount of pickpockets.,NEGATIVE
Baneasa,airport,W Drennan,4/14/2010,I've been to quite a few airports in my time but have never experienced anything like the chaos at check-in for the Blue Air flight to London I went on this morning: a completely disordered queuing system and some sort of computer failure but they weren't doing announcements about what was going on in English although I asked them politely to do so. Also despite this it took them ages to get a second line going for the London flight although there were two lines for other destinations. This all resulted in the flight being about an hour and a half late. This airport badly needs modernising (or replacing!).,NEGATIVE
Bangalore,airport,Dileep Satya,12/12/2024,It’s pathetic that after coming out of the Terminal 1 aero bridge we need to walk down a floor carrying our bags.

Bangalore,airport,Mohammed Ali,10/30/2024,"I recently had the opportunity to experience the new terminal at Kempegowda International Airport in Bangalore, and I must say, it is a remarkable addition to the city’s infrastructure. Design and Ambiance: The terminal boasts a stunning architectural design that blends modern aesthetics with traditional Indian elements. The spacious layout is filled with natural light, thanks to large glass facades. The use of local materials in the design adds a unique touch, making the environment both inviting and reflective of Karnataka’s heritage. Facilities: One of the standout features of the new terminal is its state-of-the-art facilities. From efficient check-in counters to well-organized security checks, the entire process felt streamlined and user-friendly. The wide range of shopping and dining options is impressive, offering everything from local delicacies to international brands. I particularly enjoyed the curated selection of souvenirs that showcase local artisans. Technology: The incorporation of technology is commendable. Free Wi-Fi, charging stations, and self-check-in kiosks make the travel experience more convenient. The digital displays for flight information are clear and easy to navigate, which is essential in such a busy hub. Sustainability: What truly sets this airport apart is its commitment to sustainability. The use of rainwater harvesting systems and solar energy reflects a forward-thinking approach to airport management, which is vital in today’s context of climate change. Accessibility: The airport is well-connected, with ample transportation options including taxis, buses, and ride-sharing services. The ease of access from the city makes it a practical choice for travelers. Overall Impression: In summary, the new terminal at Kempegowda International Airport is a remarkable blend of modernity, functionality, and cultural resonance. It elevates the travel experience and sets a high standard for airports in India. Whether you’re a frequent flyer or just passing through, this airport is a pleasant surprise that showcases the best of Bangalore.",POSITIVE
Bangalore,airport,1 reviewsBruce Lyman,8/27/2024,"The new international terminal is a nice building but the traveller experience was awful. I should add it was not just our experience but the same as others caught in the same ridiculous situation. We had arrived via a domestic flight (Indigo) which was seven hours before our international departure. We were bused to the new international terminal and told we could not enter the building because our flight didn't open for another four hours. The expectation was that we would wait on the kerb where there are no amenities, for four hours. Bureaucratic nonsense and bad experience one. After pressing the security staff we were eventually allowed into the ticketing foyer. But we were not allowed into the terminal proper and had to wait there for four hours where there are no amenities for transiting passengers. We had boarding passes for our international connections but were not allowed into the airport proper where we could make use of cafes and the lounges and bathrooms. Bad experience two - waiting in a hall not designed for waiting passengers. And not just ourselves but numerous other transit passengers as well. A nice building let down but business processes that make no sense. Worse, when I attempted to email management (feedback emails advertised everywhere) they blamed the airlines for not aligning their flights! That was really poor form. If you have a poor business process (and you do) don't blame someone else for it - solve it. The management team here need to look at every other half decent terminal around the world to see how it's done. Singapore. Bangkok. KL. Dubai.",NEGATIVE

Bangkok Don Muang,airport,Roy Griffin,8/13/2023,"I found the Airport lacking in equality, they provide services for most people however not for people that choose to smoke. I spent 40 mins searching for a smoking area and when I found one it was hidden behind bushes, is if they are embarrassed by people who choose to smoke, most there were Airport Staff, there was no sign saying smoking area but plenty saying no smoking. Smoking is legal and the people that choose to should not be treated as embarrassing or like lepers. Most good International Airports provide a smoking area, so they cater for all differing people. I have to leave outside as late as possible, and cannot use the Food, Beverages, duty free or shopping areas as there is no time.

Ok both legs of my journey, check in was OK as was passport control but my flight was one of the last out at night so was relatively quiet anyway, only restaurant was McDonalds which I don't eat, a couple of coffee stalls with few sandwiches etc..

Bangkok Don Muang,airport,D Barter,6/2/2022,"The domestic terminal is better than the international, seemingly having been refurbished during Covid. Both have adequate food options. Plenty of seating. Clean. Domestic departures. At security beware the overzealous and brusque female personnel with their metal detector wands. A small coin inadvertently left in a pocket will immediately incur their wrath. Perhaps their rigorous practical training could also include occasional use of the words 'please' and 'thank you'. Polite manners to avoid confrontations are as important when dealing with foreigners as they are with the locals. International departures: leave plenty of time for passport control and security which is efficient but there can be long queues.

I panicked and thought there was no hope that I would find the goods. I called the airport just to try our luck.

Only a few moments later, the airport called me that they found my items at the lost and found. A janitor had turned them in. We can arrange to collect the items anytime.

The public transportation when we arrived was quite easy and rather systematic to use, euther taxi, Grab, bus or rail link.

Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,airport,C Markam,8/24/2024,Get your steps in at Bangkok airport. And then rest up at the luggage carousel. Extremely long walks to get from gate to immigration. Then 30 mins wait for luggage. Then 30 min wait for Grab taxi. Just never gets better at this airport.,NEGATIVE
Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,airport,E Malton,6/30/2024,"Great airport, but it is huge and can take up to 25 minutes to get from gate to gate if in transit. Good variety of shops and restaurants, lots of toilets which are always clean. It's a shame there's no areas to relax apart from at gates. Singapore, Doha, KL etc all have sofa areas and big TV's to watch, which is great when you have a long lay over. I always thought there were smoking rooms here, but weren't. Not an issue if you have a lay over of more than 5hrs as you can go through immigration and leave the airport. I did, however, find cigarette butts behind floor standing AC units on two occasions at un-manned gates, where passengers and probably staff hide and have a quick smoke. I even smelt cigarette smoke at one point, so people obviously are smoking in the terminals. Some staff seemed quite unhelpful and stand-offish though when I asked about a few things, but mainly young ones who were more interested in what was on their mobile phones.",POSITIVE
Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,airport,Lauren Weitzman,6/15/2024,"I stopped at this airport on a three leg journey back from Laos with a three hour layover. This airports seating options already leave a lot to be desired, but when I tried to go down one floor to my gate, I was turned away for “security” reasons. I found an uncomfortable chair upstairs near my gate. Flash forward to an hour before boarding time and there are tons of people sitting upstairs on the floor because we’re not allowed down to the gate even though we’re the next flight to depart? Uncomfortable and frustrating. Plus the aggravation of watching the entire crew go down while we weren’t allowed to take all the seating downstairs.",NEGATIVE
Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,airport,D Hanson,6/2/2024,"Bag drop for QR is always at the west end of the airport. Since QR is a OneWorld airline, QR aircraft have always been parked at that end of the main terminal. WIth security, immigration and the QR lounge all nearby, flying QR has always had little hassle. Before it opened, the airport authorities stated that the new satellite terminal would be for THAI and a few other Star Alliance carriers. Not so, as unfortunately QR aircraft are now parked here. As if this airport does not already desperately need more moving walkways through what is now a borrible shopping mall all along its main terminal departures level, the same is true of the hike now required to get to the satellite gates. It's a reasonably long walk from the QR lounge to the escalators taking one down for the short train ride. But once you get up the escalators, the situation re walkways is almost as bad as the main terminal. Be prepared for a long slog to your aircraft. Why the BKK authorities did not install more walkways totally beats me! A really bad start and finish to the flight experience.",NEGATIVE
Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,airport,Andy Phua,3/9/2024,"I was at the fast track lane, going home from a week-long work trip. I did not check in my luggage and only brought a cabin-sized luggage.

This is the only airport that I have been to that makes travellers remove a single razor blade from the razor. It is a hassle and a waste of time that negated all time savings from the fast track lane.",NEGATIVE

Bangor,airport,Vitaliia Tomakhiv,7/27/2023,"Always loved this airport, but, unfortunately, not this time. I am flying frequently from 2017 and I am aware of what can be brought in carry-on baggage and in what sizes. Officers at the bag control opened my bag and threw out all the bottles (each of which were exactly 100 ml). When I told “But it is 100 ml, it is allowed”, they answered “We allow under 100 ml”. I have never heard this before during 7 years of traveling. I have been traveling through all the world and it always have been 100 ml limit for liquid item in carry-on. I went to website of the airlines, and the airport and each sections clearly states “items do not have to EXCEED 100 ml” or “liquid cannot be larger than 100 ml”. I brought these items from another country and that supposed to be gifts for my friends. It is not something I can buy in the US. No gifts, no mood. Thank you Bangor airport. Firstly, I suggest to know the rules and educate yourself prior to violating passengers’ rights",NEGATIVE
Bangor,airport,K Ashley,7/9/2012,There was one person in the whole airport who knew what was going on. The rest of them were rude and clue less. We missed our flight because they had 2 people working a very thorough security screening for a line of at least 120 passengers. It took them so long that we missed our flight along with about 6 other people. They are incredibly understaffed. They ended up costing us nearly $300 extra to rebook our flight and didn't offer to pay for a hotel or anything. Be thorough at security but have the staff to handle the passengers. They also claim they called everyone's names over the intercom. Not a single person heard their name. They said at first that we would not be able to leave until Monday (two days later) and that all flights were booked. Luckily two people cancelled on a flight for the next day and we were able to board. It was a nightmare to say the least.,NEGATIVE

Banjul,airport,P Nunn,1/4/2025,"I have been using this airport for 12 years with approximately 20 visits. It has never been a particularly good airport but has deteriorated significantly despite so-called 'improvements' in recent years. Some of my concerns include the arrival process, where the entry tax was £10 when I first started coming to The Gambia and was paid to the airline; now it is £30 and payable as soon as you arrive at the airport through a laboriously long process. Passport control can take an hour, even if the cameras are working, and the staff are very unfriendly. Despite nearly two hours spent paying the tax and going through passport control, you still have to wait for your suitcase at the baggage carousel. After that, you must navigate the final security check, where the staff often try to solicit items from you. Finally, you reach the arrivals hall - if you can navigate the hoards of people almost blocking the exit. I won’t go into the details of the departure experience, but suffice it to say, it involves poor organisation, rude staff, overly long security checks, and a now very small departure lounge.",NEGATIVE
Banjul,airport,30 reviewsD Sarzen,4/13/2023,"First of all, plan on leaving very early as the road to the airport is always congested, after that being said, be prepared for some hassle. First you need to line up in order to pay a 20 USD or equivalent ""Development tax"", then the airline ""security"" will photograph your passport and all the stamps/visa in it, then you will be allowed to check in. After that, you will need to clear immigration, be prepared to have people jumping the queue in front of you and no one will say anything. Some officers want you to fill the departure form, others will let you go without it. Security line is fast as long as you do not have computers etc... inside the carry on. Do not shop in foreign currency at the duty free or you will be ripped off, if you need to exchange your last dalasis, you will be able to, but they will give you lots of coins, which for me was just fine. Blackouts are common at this airport, just saying. Boarding is chaotic, they do not respect the classes or groups, anything goes. People needing wheelchair will literally be carried by 3-4 men from the tarmac to the plane and be prepared to tip. The only thing that worked fine in here believe it or not was the WiFi, it was free and fast.",NEGATIVE
Banjul,airport,Jessica Wickham,3/12/2023,"Staff are unpleasant like they don't really want you to come to their country. Staff don't communicate with their colleagues in English, instead they speak their local language throughout and that is disturbing and completely wrong in a work setting. Staff are not friendly and helpful, very aggressive. The customer service at Banjul Airport is appalling",NEGATIVE
Banjul,airport,1 reviewsJulie Laurent,3/13/2022,Upon leaving The Gambia the airport has changed lots but it still needs adjustments. Make sure you have a combination lock or at least get your luggage wrapped to prevent items being removed from your luggage. The theft was very disappointing and was a bitter pill to swallow after such a lovely family holiday.,NEGATIVE
Banjul,airport,Val Theobalds,8/28/2021,"Getting through the departure area at Banjul airport The Gambia to get to the UK is beyond ridiculous. 1) Firstly when you arrive to the airport you have to queue and weigh your luggage outside of the airport on scales. 2) You then proceed to pay 1000GMD PP departure tax about £16 at another area 3) You are then shown to the first check in point where you need to show the following, Covid test vaccination proof for the UK. Evidence that a day 2 test has been booked in the UK. We had to challenge the staff here as they were stating that a day 8 was needed as well. Not if you are doubled jabbed. Covid test result in The Gambia Passenger locator form for the UK. PP 4) Luggage drop - the conveyor belt does not work. So you weigh your luggage and take them off to place them back onto the luggage trolley. Air Brussels are strict with weight and do not give you an inch. Your hand luggage is also weighed at this point. 5) Passengers proceed to bag security where the luggage is scanned, checked and can be opened (so have your keys ready) The bags are then weighed again. Once this is done the bags are taken by a man to be placed in holding. 6) Next stop - The passenger locator form for Brussels then needs to be shown at another desk. 7) Travellers then need to proceed to immigration, where eye scans, a further PP check is done and finger prints are taken 8) Another security check again for hand luggage which is scanned and your PP is checked again. 9) The final check is done before you board the plane and access the bus. Covid test result - despite being shown already Standard PP check boarding pass Hand luggage is weighed again Boarding pass for connecting flights need to be shown as well. I would suggest leaving early to get to the airport. I would also suggest that you eat inside the airport at the restaurant to the top right. The restaurant past the final check point is limited and more expensive too. You are also attacked by flies whilst eating. There is no duty free shopping either.",NEGATIVE
Banjul,airport,David Taylor,2/21/2020,"Terrible, the airport is being redeveloped and is a mess. Arrivals and departures are handled via a roughly constructed shed like entrance and exit which is hopelessly overcrowded. Security on arrival is slow and visa is obtained at the entrance - staff reasonably efficient. Baggage check on exit is slapdash and chaotic. No airbridges - you are bussed to and from your flights.",NEGATIVE
Banjul,airport,4 reviewsSebastian Noethlichs,6/11/2017,Banjul airport is old but works very fast. So long as there aren't multiple flights arriving or departing at the same time you can make it from the entrance to the lounge in 5 minutes. There is limited seating and the departure hall lacks air conditioning. The upstairs lounge is air conditioned. Passport control is fast and hassle free - no fingerprinting or cameras.,POSITIVE
Banjul,airport,Patrick Gold,12/20/2016,"We found Banjul airport very efficient and friendly. As we were on foot from the main road we were expecting a long walk to the terminal, but we shouldn't have worried as within 10m of the airport entrance we were asked if we would like a lift in a chauffeur driven car taking the security supervisor to work. We gratefully accepted and on reaching the terminal he insisted on helping us check in quickly as we had no hold baggage. Boarding cards in hand we rapidly went through security and 2 mins later were sitting in the pleasant open air departure area and ordering a couple of beers and a sandwich. Service indeed and for the most part delivered with a smile.",POSITIVE
Banjul,airport,N Stacey,1/10/2011,I have been travelling to the Gambia for a number of years now and the airport has declined in over the years. The airport used to be a very friendly place to travel through but now major problems with long queues at check in especially. What makes matters worse is they now charge you £18 for the privilege of it all when you leave the country and there were a lot of unhappy passengers on my last visit. It can take between 1-2 hours just to pay the money check in and go through security in utter chaos. The trouble is some of the flights are now to close together and this is a contributing factor.,NEGATIVE
Banjul,airport,Nigel Stacey,5/29/2010,I have been travelling to the Gambia for six years now and have seen alot of changes at the airport over the years. Security are very friendly people. You can even sit out in the open and have a drink and a bite to eat and watch your plane land.,POSITIVE
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,2 reviewsE Carmere,3/14/2024,"It was a very unpleasant experience at Bridgetown airport, while arrival was still acceptable the departure was a nightmare. The counters for check in are opening later as the announced time on the tickets, very long queue for security and no fast track however it seemed passengers from a particular cruise line with some 99% passengers from the UK did obtain priority. Officers doing the security were extremely unpolite and very disrespectful, shouting to passengers as a drill sergeant to recruits - give them a uniform and they all think they are important . Restrooms not clean at all, boarding the plane was chaotic.",NEGATIVE
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Patricia Merlo,1/2/2024,"It is astonishing that Barbados Grantley Airport is still as unfriendly and disorganised as other reviewers described it years ago. Although we were in transit, we had to have all our belongings scanned again by customs and this was done incredibly slowly and with unfriendly, harsh orders from the officials. The most amazing thing was that they shouted at us because some of us were carrying rum in sealed bags from Grenada Duty Free. They treated the people concerned as if they were serious criminals. The bags were confiscated. The people concerned asked what would happen to them now. We were told that we would get them back at the gate. At the gate, the staff knew nothing about it. They just shrugged their shoulders and kept the passengers waiting for about half an hour. Then an employee set off, slow as a snail, and finally came back with 3 bags. He crawled off again and brought a few more bags. Everyone got on the plane, even those who hadn't got their bags back. The crew finally took care of the matter and the rest were brought onto the plane. The passengers were accused by the airport staff of not having listened. However, we were still unable to take off as the airport's passenger system suddenly went on strike and several officials had to go through the aircraft to count us several times. After an hour's delay, we saw Barbados getting smaller under the aircraft. I will definitely not be returning to this inhospitable airport, no way!",NEGATIVE
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,J Thompson,3/9/2019,Never stepping foot in this airport again. Even if it’s a connecting flight I’ll either do everything in my power to get a straight flight or I will straight-up cancel.

I had a wonderful trip in Barbados but this type of experience cast a negative view over my overall trip. I wouldn’t return here because of this. Terrible staff in the airport, not the lasting impression that should be sent on with visitors.",NEGATIVE
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,S James,3/18/2018,"The arrival process at this airport post passport control is truly, truly awful. I have never encountered such rude, and on one occasion aggressive customs staff - ever. There is no organisation, reason or process as to why people are forced to queue for lengthy periods of time whilst others simply glide through. On one section of the compulsory entry form I was shouted at for not completing the section on how many children were accompanying me. When I said I had none, and that if this was the case the form said to pass on to the next section the customs lady shouted at me and told me to complete it anyway. Residents and visitors alike are treated with equal disdain - unless of course you pay for a porter or private pre-arranged fast track. Perhaps therein lies the reason why lesser mortals are treated in such an abominable fashion.",NEGATIVE
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Lesley Eames,1/4/2018,"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have had the misfortune to pass through. Both arrival and departure were very stressful. I travelled with two people who needed wheelchair assistance. On arrival we had to wait on the plane for about three quarters of an hour because there is only one ""cherry picker"" (the contraption that lifts the wheelchair folk from the plane to the ground) and this was in use elsewhere (there are no air bridges at this airport). We were lucky, with special assistance we jumped the queues, but it still took an hour. I felt sorry for those in the huge queue for immigration which seemed to move at a snail's pace. Our special assistance lady got us a redcap porter, I'm not sure I would have managed without her as they were thin on the ground. She also took us to the front of the queue for customs clearance, there was also a long queue for this. No walking through a door signed ""nothing to declare"". She then got us a taxi. Honestly without her I really don't know how we would have managed. The whole place is chaotic. Perhaps they have expanded faster than they can cope with. The return journey was slightly better as we were able to use the club lounge. This is shared between all airlines and is more like an upmarket cafe than a club lounge, but it's a haven from the scrum downstairs. I hope never to have to pass through this airport ever again.",NEGATIVE
Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Tim Parsons,12/28/2016,"Possibly the slowest airport I have been through. Long queues arriving and departing.

The officer who processed our forms was not friendly but that was acceptable he wasn't rude. Next were the female customs staff, we have never encountered anyone so openly hostile, rude, ill mannered officers at any airport and we are frequent travellers. One officer was marching up and down the line being openly aggressive, while the other one who checked your documents did not speak but pointed and clicked her fingers to communicate with you without eye contact. Meanwhile the redcaps were walking by with passengers and were exempt from this why? We will avoid this airport in the future this is not the face Barbados wants to present to the world, please re train or replace these individuals, meanwhile remind them that we (the visitors) are paying their salaries and treat the people they serve with some respect or at least basic manners.",NEGATIVE

Barcelona,airport,J Woolley,1/5/2025,"The staff really let this airport down. And everything everyone else said negatively below (heat of airport, difficult layout, unhelpful security/info) unfortunately remains true as of Jan 2025. Airport amenities wise average, but the staff, especially passport control seem to actually enjoying belittling, ignoring & dismissing people. It’s horrible to experience that level of nastiness. As others have said the passport queues are ridiculously long & it’s a long walk across the airport. It takes time to get to the gate with elderly/infirm people or young children. We set off for our gate the second it popped up - when we got to passport control the queue was huge. Many people in the queue were worried about missing their flight, us included. When we explained, extremely politely, to the queue staff our concerns she shrugged, said she didn’t care & coldly told us we had to queue at the back. Nice! When we finally got to the man (policia nationale) stamping our passports, he asked if we were going to London. When we said yes, (knowing we were now cutting it fine for our flight) he stamped one then literally put the others to one side while he spent a few minutes answering a what’s app message totally ignoring us (the picture which had popped up on his phone made it clear it was a personal text). We politely waited & bit our tongues knowing he was enjoying his little moment of power until he finally slowly stamped the other passports & literally threw them back at us. Our kids were bewildered as to why the man ‘didn’t like us’! Whole experience stressful & made us feel completely unwelcome. Such a shame - we really loved Barcelona but the stress of almost missing our flight & being treated so nastily means we will visit Seville or Madrid (or another country entirely) next time which we found a much more pleasant experience overall.",NEGATIVE

They started letting people through a shorter queue selecting at random, after a long wait. We pushed our way through to this desk as we weren't chosen to go into this shorter queue. Otherwise we would have had to wait even longer. This airport is taking away our precious holiday time with its long delays. On the way back it was even worse, the worse airport I have ever been in. The staff didn't speak English and couldn't even say thank you in English. They were definitely so rude. Surely they should speak English as it is an airport. Most of the hotels, taxis, shops, restaurants in Barcelona speak a little English. Avoid this airport if you can, they are making no effort to rectify the appalling queues and staff.

Barcelona,airport,Emily Curran,7/27/2024,"I took a flight on Air Senegal from Dakar to Barcelona and was meant to transit in Barcelona to Dublin. My bag did not arrive in Barcelona, and due to long immigration lines I missed my flight to Dublin. I rebooked a flight for that evening, and then spent the entire day tracking down each of the four luggage carriers in Barcelona airport; all of them claimed to not work with Air Senegal, and kept sending me back to each other. I went back and forth from Terminal 1 to 2 repeatedly, and when I asked for help at information kiosks the staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful, acting as if it was an inconvenience for them to provide information, which is their job. I was in tears after a few hours of this. Each luggage carrier claimed that they don’t work with Air Senegal so they would not allow me to fill in a declaration form, which is needed for the lost luggage to be entered in the system. I also was unable to claim the insurance on my lost bag that I had prepaid for because they would not allow me to fill the declaration form. The only luggage carrier that was helpful was Avia Partner; there were two staff there who were really lovely and the male staff member even helped me to fill a declaration form manually. Unfortunately a manual form does not enter the loss into any systems, it just documents that I was there. I called Barcelona Airport repeatedly after finally arriving in Dublin and the Barcelona Airport staff refused to help me once again. I still have no idea where my bag is one month later. While this is a shared problem between Air Senegal and Barcelona Airport, I felt that I was not treated respectfully by the majority of staff in the airport and overall it was an awful experience of which I hope does not happen to anyone again. If anyone finds a large red suitcase lying around Barcelona Airport, please let me know. I would seriously consider switching airports if you can on your trip and avoid Barcelona completely.

Bari Palese,airport,3 reviewsMiles Damone,8/23/2016,"When we arrived at Bari airport there was no queue for check in and security didn't have a big queue so we could eat around the airport. I noticed that the airport had expanded so it has lots more shops and new flights. There is a choice of 3 restaurants, 2 bars with the local drinks and food from the area. 1 pharmacy to collect sun cream and more, 2 small shops with guides to other countries, newspapers in over 4 languages and then another 5-7 shops selling DVDs, magazines, playing cards, food from the area, memories of Bari etc. Also it's easy to rent cars and only a 5-10 minute drive to areas in Bari and less than 3 minutes to the nearest beach.",POSITIVE
Bari Palese,airport,Pawel Litwinski,9/2/2013,Arrival was perfect. Departure - a different story: chaotic queues people crowding everywhere. Was given wrong boarding passes (for my wife while my wife got hers) had to come back and queue again. Security did not find a 1.5 litre bottle of water in my carry on luggage. Just one bathroom in service for the whole departure hall.,NEGATIVE
Barnaul,airport,David Pryer,12/10/2008,The terminal is Soviet-style and a little big for just 2 or 3 flights a day to Moscow and the occasional charter. Check-in was slow with initially only one desk open but the service was friendly and efficient when eventually obtained. With a blizzard on the tarmac it was unsafe for the bus to drive out to the plane. Stumbling across the whipped up snow and ice is not something for the fainthearted. The early offer of an onboard drink was appreciated.,NEUTRAL
Barra Eoligarry,airport,Alex Johnson,4/20/2017,"Barra is an amazing airport - it's tiny, shed like and has few facilities. The most people there at one time will only be approx. 20 as the flights are operated by little twin otters. What makes Barra great is the runway - it's the beach. The approach and landing experience are a must. Also once you've got off and collect your bag from a shelter in the car park you've got a maximum of 50 metres to walk to your car, taxi or bus (they meet every flight and are a good way to get around the islands).",POSITIVE
Barra Eoligarry,airport,Matthew Ross,8/31/2005,"Tiny. But stunning location. Barra Aiport sits on the edge of a wide beach on the Scottish Island of Barra. Twice a day (once in winter) flights from Glasgow and Benbencula land on one of the three runways. But these are no ordinary tarmac runways. These are marked out on the sand of the beach - and only when the tide is out! The flights are the only British Airways flights where the timetable is marked ""subject to tide"". The terminal a proper little toy-town terminal complete with tiny terminal control tower big burly firemen and one check-in desk. No compromise though on safety checks and procedures. Be sure to be here in good time to watch the incoming Twin Otter fly in and land on the beach. The tiny cafe sells lovely home made organic snacks and the whole experiences is a joy if you have only been used to the hustle and bustle and chaos of some large well known international terminals. If a glorious sunny day check-in good and early and take time to stroll three hundred yards up over the dunes to see the other stunning beach close to this amazing little airport.",POSITIVE
Basel Mulhouse,airport,Helen Smith,1/25/2025,What a nightmare this Airport still is. Passport Control completely disorganized and overcrowded. This has been going on for years. The Airport publishes in its Report that it has made changes to improve the passenger Experience or better ordeal but nothing ever changes. It is really worth traveling to a different airport even if journey time is much longer. Avoid!!,NEGATIVE
Basel Mulhouse,airport,Vincent Menting,8/21/2024,"I have been using Basel airport for two decades and the service quality has been bad ever since. Compared to for instance Zurich staff are so rude and unfriendly at Basel. There is far too little terminal seating or staff will not let you use it. Toilet Cleanliness is an issue here as well.

Basel Mulhouse,airport,Richard Richards,6/27/2024,"This airport has to be the worst in Europe. Not only does it have the least courteous staff in the Swissport staff at the desks (typically 'French' in attitude), but the airport itself is dated, uncomfortable and disorganised. There is no or very little seating, so people sit on the ground taking up corridor space. Your food and beverage offering is minimal, slow and abysmal for an international airport. Your baggage handling system and technology is not fir for purpose, as demonstrated on a recent flight that was cancelled to Copenhagen where it took you 2 hours to get bags off an aircraft that hadn't even left! Your airport's treatment of passengers on a cancelled flight was shameful and a total abdication of passenger care responsibility. I would rather fly to Zurich and take a train than ever fly through your dreadful, airport again. The only positive area of your airpot is the Business Centre, which I used for the second time. Efficient, courteous, functional and professional. The rest is a disaster!",NEGATIVE
Basel Mulhouse,airport,A Warden,6/3/2024,"We had a very unpleasant experience with an immigration officer when leaving Basel which really put a damper on our nice trip. Unbeknownst to me you are not permitted food or drink while going through immigration to get to your gate (I did not see a sign as we entered the queue and I would have expected you could take food/drink through, as it wasn't security and there are lots of cafes around!). We approached the counter, and I put my coffee on the counter to grab our passports. The officer pointed to a small sticker on his window which had a picture of a drink and hamburger with a slash across it saying ""NEIN! No food or drink! This is not a restaurant!"" He said this in a very nasty way and handled our passports rudely, throwing them back at me after he stamped them. I asked him where I could throw out my coffee but he ignored me. My daughter, who was about a foot behind me, took a sip of her water and again he yelled ""NEIN!"". She was so shocked, she literally jumped.

Basel Mulhouse,airport,Duncan Lloyd-Davies,7/5/2023,If you are coming from Switzerland traffic conditions are unexpectedly poor through Basel. Arrived Friday 30 June at approx 1920 for EasyJet flight to Bristol scheduled for 2120. The EasyJet bag drop was OK; they appear to have exclusive use of Hall 3. The security scanning was OK. The passport control was not in same vicinity but some way down the “arm” containing the gates and There was a long queue. There had been no indication that it was a good idea to continue to Passport Control. I had assumed there would not be this further check. Nothing to do with Airport but flight 2hrs 10 minutes late. There were a large number of late evening flights but all cafes were shut. There were some vending machines but one of them took my money without giving me anything.

Beauvais,airport,S Hunter,9/25/2024,"Having spent far too much time of my trip to Paris looking at reviews of BVA and becoming convinced that I'd definitely miss my flight/my luggage would be pulled apart/I'd have to stand for 4-5 hours with no rest, to say I was pleasantly surprised by my airport experience would be an understatement. Beauvais is a hub for budget airlines. No one should be under any illusion that you're flying out of CDG or another mega airport in a capital city. Could the departure hall use a lick of paint? Probably. Could a few more benches be put in? Absolutely. But as a functioning airport with many flights departing at similar times, it manages the best it can. We arrived at the airport early due to all of the fear-mongering in reviews, but it allowed us to see that the airport tries its best to manage the flow of traffic. There are screens over security confirming when you'll be able to go through passport control in relation to your flight time (approx. 2.5 hours for us, in line with the bag drop opening), and from there through to the end of security, it was barely even 5 minutes until we were in duty free. As I removed my liquids and electricals in advance (as nearly all airports expect and clearly have signposted, as is the same in BVA), there were no issues with security. Duty free is admittedly sparse, but there were signs up confirming that maintenance work was ongoing. The toilets were adequate, and there was a café open for use, as well as vending and hot drinks machines. There were plug sockets (FYI - not usb ports) and, in the grand scheme of things, a fair number of benches - there are 5 departure gates, and 2 of those are in a separate area, so the space is distributed fairly. In fact, the only issues that I could see occurring were from fellow passengers themselves! People with luggage double the size of the restrictions were being asked to pay the fee at the gate, but this should not be a surprise for anyone who spends even 30 seconds looking at their boarding card information. Likewise, an outgoing flight was held, but this was due to passengers being late to the gate (the call was done in English, French and the language of the flight destination, so there really were no excuses). If people try to blame the airport for this, then they should be taking a longer look at themselves. I'm ultimately reviewing BVA for what it is; a budget friendly space to travel for those of us who don't want to break the bank.",NEUTRAL

First, after waiting in the line for the airport checkpoint, a very nice man is waiting for you. He doesn’t speak English because this airport doesn’t cover international flights and there is no need to speak English. Luckily me I speak some French to understand what he is mumbling between shouts. This man shouts at everybody because, why not, the airport is his belonging and he can act whatever he likes to. And if you don’t show him at once all the five tickets for the 5 people you are with, he will shout at you and let other people pass in front of you. After escaping the first test, you arrive at the checkpoint. Where the staff doesn’t know that if you are a diabetic and have a sensor, it’s allowed to get a bottle of water with you inside the airport. Of course, she has to put it in special tray and scan it, but she doesn’t want to do that because it’s to complicated. This is not the end and after you pass the second test, you arrive at the gate.  I don’t know who trains these people but the obviously they didn’t find out that Romania is now in Schengen Area and continue to verify each person’s ID. And after that you have to stand in line, outside the building, 30 minutes or more, no matter if it’s hot or freezing outside. And that’s it! I’ve never felt more humiliated in my entire life, I have to say that one more time. I hope I never see this airport and I don’t recommend it.",NEGATIVE

The management should be fined. They should face sanctions. The company should be fined. Beauvais is a terrible experience. Avoid this airport if you can. Ryanair to Birmingham 15.20 still hasn't boarded at 16.51 and they are telling us we all need to pads through security again. I've visited dozens of airports across the world and Beauvais is the worst it is the pits, it is toilet. Disorganized uncomfortable and bady managed and awful if there is the slightest problem.

We arrived at the airport at 15:00 and we where presented by a massive Q, at first we thought that's fine we will slowly head through to Security and get everything checked etc. Sadly not, the Q didn't move and when we asked why not, staff where very rude and said only certain flights go through first. We were still in the Q at 16:15, and more people had joined the Q for the flight to EDI. The staff then came to us at 16:40 and then told us to hurry and skip the Q to Security. Let's say it was a mad rush and we were still going through security checks at 16:55 and the announcement said Ryanair flight at 17:00 now closing and no more boarding!

Instead of expecting others to know his language, he should learn how to speak proper English himself since he is working at an airport that deals with international arrivals and departures.

Staff were chasing foreign travellers and ordering them to remove their hats (not in immigration or security, just anywhere in the airport where they wanted to track you). Foreign travellers arriving go to booths to be finger printed (this is becoming more common in Asia). Even to go through international transit, you will have your face photographed (and scanned into their systems). Then once you’re on board, Air China flights all have state security agents, dressed in black who walk up and down the flight carrying a camera.

Due to their lack of communication, my dad who was using a wheelchair was left waiting and was the only passenger to use the wheelchair service who was without his family. Air China airline staff told my brother who was putting his bag in the cabin overhead bins to wait and allowed at least 100 passengers through the aisles before I finally took matters into my own hands and stored the bag in the overhead bins myself.

Beijing Capital,airport,S Valderi,6/6/2024,"I can't help but being disappointed at my experience with Terminal 3 at Beijing Airport. I had two transits there, on the way to and back from Japan, once in the early morning (5am), and once in the evening (7pm). The terminal is large, pleasant to move around, and quite clean. Water is free, in paper cups, which isn't always the same. The negatives are many, so I'll start with a big one: the wifi is awful. An absurd number of websites are blocked, this being China, but even those feel random. Youtube is a no-go, but Whatsapp works fine. Instagram worked for my girlfriend, but not for me. Twitter worked on the first transit, but not the second. This might seem minor, but the anoyance accumulates when you're left with nothing at all to do in an empty terminal. Because it is empty: food and shops option are severely limited, with only one restaurant and one perfume shop being open when we were there, even though it wasn't too late or early. I was looking forward to buying a magazine in Chinese since I'm studying it, but those were nowhere to be found. Food itself is fine, but comes with a caveat, the severe lack of meat-free options. My girlfriend is piscitarian, but even so we found all noodle dishes and sandwiches had meat, you'll just have to make do. Going around the terminal you'll notice a severe lack of plugs, which are stingily doted out 2 at a time at specific spots. Inexplicably, at the end of the terminal a small decorated area has abundant plugs and armchairs to rest, at odds with the rest of the place, almost to reward those intrepid enough to drag their luggage so far away from everything else. The above had left a pretty mediocre impression on my first transit, but on our return it got worse, as we had to interact with staff and services. We had a 7 hour layover, so we were planning on using a lounge to rest. No such luck. We were not entitled to Air China's Business and First Class lounges, so we went to the Transit Lounge. There the staff spoke hardly any English, ""you had to book"", which was comical on several fronts. First of all, the whole airport was empty, secondly Air China's website did not say booking was mandatory. The website booking also didn't work. The (very expensive) hourly hotel? ""Full, full, all full"". It gave a strong impression that staff just couldn't be bothered to have English guests. Near the fountain a sign read ""paid lounge"", so we took an elevator down there. The stinky and mostly empty lounge sat brightly lit, but staff was seemingly unaware of the sign outside, and spoke even less English. We then decided to ask the information desk, which unhelpfully, and again with very limited English, sent us to the aforementioned lounges. ""No idea"" why they wouldn't offer paid services. A brief note on the use of English, as I don't want to sound entitled. I have studied Chinese, so I could have attempted a conversation, but after a long flight, and ahead of a transit I was quite tired. Plus, with the broken wifi, the dictionary was not available. I think it's quite normal in a space specifically designed to accomodate international travellers to account for English being spoken. Even ignoring that, and trying to use the giant tablet with map information, it's all in Chinese. It seems a sign of general disinterest that little to no effort is made to have English options, which surely is detrimental not just to travellers, but to staff.",NEGATIVE
Beijing Capital,airport,1 reviewsIvan Chumakov,4/22/2024,"I was transiting with Air China in Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3. Most international flights operate from Concourse T3E, but some use T3D. In my cause both arrival and departure were from T3E. On transit passengers need to go through document and security and customs check. The walking times are not really long and mostly travelators are available. There are 2 transfer service checkpoints, one from each side of the concourse. The crowd is not really well organized and staff is not really helpful. Not everyone speaks English, which is quite frustrating, when you actually need to communicate with airport or security staff. Arriving early in the morning, get ready to spend 1h queuing for transit. Other than that, I have to note that Terminal 3 is very modern by its looks and layout. The ceiling is high, which makes it seam like the airport is free and spacious. Walking distances are not too long. Most gates are accessible in less than 10 minutes of calm stroll. Between T3E, T3D and T3C there is an automated people mover (train), which is easily accessible after security. I didn't use it, but I located its station and observed it a little. There are few restaurants, which in my opinion are quite reasonable priced. Early in the morning only few Chinese restaurants and Western cafes were opened. The food is actually quite delicious. I would note good availability of seating spaces. Some are equipped with universal power outlets and USB chargers. If you want to use Wi-Fi, better use Wi-Fi kiosks as SMS sometimes doesn't go through. Be aware that you won't be able to use most messengers and social networks. Also it was nice to have drinking fountains within short reach from most seating areas. I would suggest considering Beijing Capital Airport as transit hub for Asia.

Beijing Daxing,airport,Andrey Gusev,3/10/2024,"The worst airport I have ever visited. We arrived at 2am and spent more than 5 hours in the queue at the border control. Only one exhausted inspector served all the flights at the night time! I have paid more than 100usd for Mummian airport hotel to rest for. But spent only 2 hours in the room due too awful management of the PKX airport. Completely stupid and passenger unfriendly management. My advice is to avoid this airport if you can. On the way back I stayed in the bus for 1 hour near the gate. My flight has been delayed, but the airport staff have started boarding and detained all the passengers in the packed bus for more than 1 hour.",NEGATIVE
Beijing Daxing,airport,Andy Wilson,6/9/2023,"Big, nice and clean airport. But that’s all. The airport (international departure) is way too big, the airport is very empty. Check-in is very frustrating. Travelled with Qatar Airways and always have had pleasant experiences with them. Not at Daxing airport. 2kg overweight for 2 person was an issue. Needed to re-arrange. After that the check-in lady wanted to weigh the cabin luggage. That was slightly overweight as well. But she wanted to charge 40USD/kg. Although it is the airlines right, never had this experience before with Qatar Airways. She didn’t want to issue the boarding pass until we cleared some stuff. After some negotiations we said we will clear at the gate. This frustrated the journey. At the end they did not check anything at the gate. The queue at the check-in counter was very long. After queuing for a while we realised a separate queue for online-check-in. Time wasted. The signs were not clear and the personnel was not pro-active to inform people. You also need to do a health declaration (arrival and departure). But the machine at the airport is a joke and doesn’t work most of the time. The security check checks every inch of your body, never had this experience as well. They have to take a photo of you prior you clear immigration, at the immigration and when going through security. Every baggage you have they need to take a photo of you and the baggage. For what?! Shops were closes in the evening (after 10pm) and hardly any food courts or restaurants. Disappointing. The connection to the airport is not so convenient: high speed trains every hour or so from Beijing West Railway Station, but the tickets need to be bought in advance. Or metro, but if you are coming from downtown, you need to change metro couple of times. Taxi would be an alternative. Overall, I would prefer Beijing Capital International Airport.",NEGATIVE
Beijing Daxing,airport,6 reviewsSun Xiaoou,2/5/2021,"The traffic of Beijing Daxing airport is very convenient. You can get there by high-speed rail. The design of Daxing airport is very grand and novel. There are many self-service check-in machines in Daxing airport. There are many open windows at the manual check-in place, and the queuing time is short. The efficiency of security inspection is high, but there are few open channels, which leads to a long queue time. After passing the security check, there are many restaurants in it, and the price is the same as that in the urban area. The departure and arrival of Daxing airport are mixed. There are many turntables at the baggage claim area, and the waiting time is very short. It's just that the airport guidelines need to be improved. I was a little confused when I went to Daxing airport for the first time. Airport WiFi is fast and supports takeout at the gate.",NEUTRAL
Beijing Daxing,airport,I Lancaster,12/14/2019,"As might be expected, clean and efficient. In fact, arriving at 07:00 the place was empty - there seemed to be only one other flight arrival around that time. But the gate is a long way from the immigration hall. There are moving walkways but it nonetheless took a while. Then a long wait for baggage. My main gripe, though, and a cautionary note: my Swiss army knife was confiscated at the train station. Carefully packed in checked baggage, never in carry-on, so no problem for the flight. But getting in to the ticket hall for the train to Beijing baggage is inspected and my knife was not allowed. Be warned! This made it an expensive train ticket. I would have enjoyed a coffee and snack but neither airport arrivals or the train station had anywhere open.",NEUTRAL

You wait for sometimes an hour to get thru passports. You complain but nothing every gets corrected. Very unhelpful staff whether it is customs, passports or even local airline staff. I have never seen such an unorganized airport in my life. One can put up with a lot of things but for officials to treat you with disrespect is totally unacceptable. For a devastated bankrupt country that relies on tourism they have a long way to go in getting their entry and exit places up to spec. Horrible airport.",NEGATIVE
Beirut,airport,B Alsabawi,10/9/2021,"Worst airport I’ve ever been to. It was my first and hopefully last time in Lebanon. I was just passing through, in transit from Cairo to Copenhagen and I’ve never been treated this badly at an airport before. I was singled out and stopped for hours after leaving the airplane and treated like a suspect for no apparent reason. After hours of questioning they finally let me go with the explanation that it’s normal procedure for anyone travelling to Europe! Which is a lie as I saw others pass through with no interrogation, and I’ve traveled back and forth to Europe from many other destinations without any trouble before and especially not when in transit. After they let me go I had to show my passport to every staff member that I passed through and they were all rude and unprofessional. The airport was too small and lacked many facilities, seating area was too crowded. The wifi was almost non existent and their coffee prices and food was too expensive and tasteless! I was followed by their duty free staff members around the airport! I haven’t seen Lebanon but my first impression of the country at their airport left a bad impression which will make me think twice before ever setting foot in their country.",NEGATIVE

Beirut,airport,Saed Abdelahad,9/10/2019,The worst and rudest staff. The 7th of September was the date to return home after visiting Lebanon for a one week vacation. Despite the long qeues at all counters and illogical controls to get into the actual bag drop zones then you face very long lines of people also waiting. I dont think I have showed my passport to so many people as I did at this airport. After all of that then you face the rudeness of the border staff. The person who was handling mine and my parents documents was one of the worst. It started as he was telling us to come thrugh one by one. When he was told that we were travelling on the same route as family he then started his rudness even more. After a lot of idiotic questions and stupid and non logical arguments we went through to the gates. The rudeness of the staff continued further to include swearing. The country itself is a nice place apart from the experience at this airport.,NEGATIVE

Belfast,airport,6 reviewsC Hill,11/21/2024,"The airport is undergoing more renovation as it seems to have been doing for the last 15 or so years, so much so I’d say that since around 2010 I’m really not sure Ive been through the airport twice and its been the same in terms of features, layout and processes due to continuous upgrades. And yet with this there seems to be very little change in the improvement to customer experience. The departure process is head and shoulders above arrivals, although is by no means in and of itself world beating. The food places are of low/average quality with generally lacklustre service and yet at very high end prices. While I’ve been lucky with queue times of late, Ive seen plenty of people complaining on social media about ridiculous wait times at departure security despite so much noise from the airport about the improvements. Seating and comfort is minimal unless you are spending £££ at one of the overpriced eateries and the general patina and cleanliness of the building interior in many places leaves a lot to be desired. On return the processing time at immigration wasn’t too bad and the wait at baggage was OK too, however the appearance of the arrivals area from departing the plane until exiting the terminal is very dated, grubby and lacklustre. It does seem like the management approach to patchwork upgrades over a very protracted period of time does not yield great results as there is never a moment where a clean start to finish customer experience is pulled off. Finally, and this was exacerbated by our early morning flight on a November morning… any airport that calls itself “International” should be offering skybridges as standard and not leaving passengers to walk the apron in the cold and rain.",NEGATIVE
Belfast,airport,Ian Coleraine,11/2/2023,"Must be soul destroying to work at this airport. I have worked in public transport all my life and find the standards and service at this ‘International Airport’ disgraceful. The food areas must be close to qualifying as a health risk and the staff seem totally lacking in morale, there is barely a clean table at any of the food areas, the floors are a mess with food simply swiped from the tables to the floor when being cleared this is extremely off putting to a customer. There are obviously staff shortages in many areas as mentioned in majority of the reviews (baggage etc) but yet currently profits for this airport are in the millions. It is disappointing that Northern Ireland residents and anyone visiting are treated to this and expected to accept it, why? Because we’ve very little choice.",NEGATIVE
Belfast,airport,P G McMah,9/23/2023,"I am sad to say that this airport is the worst I have ever encountered in all my years travelling! The staff are overly officious, the atmosphere is more reminiscent of a prison that an airport. Security staff were unnecessarily abrupt, imperatives were used with satisfaction, ‘move’ ‘get’ ‘take’ ‘put’. The business lounge was ‘The Worst’ I have ever visited. The carpet was filthy, the toilet unsanitary, the food selection basic. The lady at the reception desk must have been trained in customer care by North Korea. Our flight had a delay which meant that there was no ground staff to meet us. We sat for approximately 30mins waiting for staff to meet the flight. This ‘airport’ is an absolute joke! It is time that they stopped playing airport and got their act together.",NEGATIVE
Belfast,airport,Brandon Ferris,1/7/2023,"I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews of this airport but I wanted to reassure people that the airport is not as bad as it seems. Most of the travel crisis in July 2022 was not the airports fault. Yes it is slightly run down but the service was excellent and it serves as a good base for EasyJet and Jet2. Security was a breeze and Jet2 queues were non existent. I actually found the toilets clean and the airport was clean with clear signs to the gate and there was no delays. I am sorry if you had a bad experience during the travel crisis but with more airlines joining in 2023 I can only assume the airport will improve. Jet2 has 24 locations from Belfast. I found it clean, convenient and will travel again with Jet2 next year. Staff were polite, even when I accidentally left my aftershave in my hand luggage going through security. They gave me a plastic bag to put it in and were friendly with me. I’ve never had any problems with the airport. The other thing is, the Northern Ireland economy isn’t Dubai economy, so it’s not like you are walking into Dubai International with Etihad Airways and expecting everything to be made of glass. Belfast City may be more efficient for short haul flights, but Belfast International has more destinations overseas. I think for an airport in Northern Ireland with the current economy, Belfast International is actually an excellent airport despite the reviews. It’s probably best to bear in mind, Dublin Airport and London Heathrow Airport faced the same kind of issues as Belfast when it came to delays, so Belfast isn’t the odd one out. It probably gets more of a bad reputation just because it’s slightly run down. But I think it’s excellent and is set to improve. I have heard reports of vomit on the floor and rude staff, but perhaps that was sorted by the time I was travelling. Many external factors meant there was delays and issues. It could do with being updated and prices reduced but apart from that it is excellent. I don’t have a photo but the lounge looks first class! I would highly recommend this airport and would give it 5 stars all the way considering the issues it faces were not it’s fault, it’s just got a worse reputation than it actually deserves! Airport Hotel nearby means it’s efficient and there are plenty of car parking spaces too! Brilliant! Would highly recommend this airport!",NEUTRAL

Our flex-economy ticket gave us access to the Aspire lounge which was very quiet but well stocked with food and beverages.

They have changed the layout of the roads in the airport to accommodate their £3 parking charge to drop off/pick up passengers, the new system is quite confusing for anyone not familiar with it and £3 to drop off/pick up is just pure greed. Car parking was ok for a change, the anpr camera actually worked this time and issued me with a ticket then opened up. Check in was simple enough but as before there is a distinct lack of seating in departures. The vast bulk of seating is swallowed up by overpriced eateries. I didn't see any mobile charging ports etc although I believe there are some in the private lounge that will cost you around £30 to enter.

The service was disastrous — unprofessional, arrogant, and unfriendly. Despite having three people behind the counter, only one appeared to be working.

Belgrade,airport,J Jankic,10/16/2024,"Changes at the airport are for the worse. While the old Terminal 1 was a true architectural gem, its upgrade in the early 1980s brought the modern Terminal 2. However, the ongoing extension, which has dragged on for years, is nothing more than a dull corridor made from prefabricated materials. With this latest expansion, the airport has shifted from being one of the most passenger-friendly for regional transfers to one of the least accommodating. The attitude of the staff has also deteriorated, from being exceptionally relaxed and friendly to becoming cold, and, in my most recent experience (e.g., at the transfer desk), even arrogant and rude. This is something we were not accustomed to in Belgrade. One area in need of improvement is cleanliness. Belgrade is now one of the dirtiest airports —stepping into the terminal from a bus transfer feels like stepping into a trash can. The state of the toilets only adds to this poor impression.",NEGATIVE

The airport has been undergoing renovations for years, yet the promised improvements for passengers seem elusive. Instead of seeing progress, parts of the airport already show signs of wear and tear. The infrastructure appears hastily patched up rather than professionally renovated, which is evident in the airport's deteriorating condition. The airport lacks the capability to fuel planes in rainy weather, resulting in extensive delays. This operational deficiency is unacceptable for a modern airport and has a significant impact on travelers' schedules and overall experience. Moreover, rain leaks inside the airport building and further highlights the inadequate maintenance and planning. Some employees were outright rude and displayed a lack of professionalism. One of the most disappointing aspects of my visit was the food offered at the airport. The quality was shockingly poor, the prices were exorbitant considering the dismal quality and service.

My time at immigration must be around 11.45 am after landing, in a panel there were 2 young ladies, the one who was attending me was not fluent in English, she saw my passport, asked my destination and without even listening told me to go to transfer desk. In the meanwhile checking my passport she constantly kept on laughing with her female colleague while I was waiting for her to check my details and let me through so that I can take my bag and check in again. She barely gave any importance and I was highly dissatisfied with her unprofessional behavior. Have never seen immigration officers so unprofessional during their work. Because of this lady officer I had to go to the transfer desk, where I was supposed to check in with my big luggage, but as I could not pick up my luggage I was told by the person in charge of checking me in there that she will take care of it. When I reached Tivat on the next flight that flew on 20th August 13:40 from Belgrade I came to know my luggage did not arrive.

Transporting animals is stressful and hard, and waiting in the middle of a busy terminal was unacceptable. If the dog had been checked in on time, and normal procedures followed as advised by the airline (covering the cage, placing the cage in a quiet area) there would have been no concerns.

Belize,airport,K Gates,1/3/2014,Small minimal facilities not much to do while you wait. Staff are friendly and efficient. The day we arrived there was live music playing in the customs area - nice touch! We walked out of the terminal to be greeted immediately by our tour arranger.,POSITIVE
Belize,airport,Gerald Preis,7/27/2004,My trip to Belize took me through BZE 3 times. It is a classic sleepy 2-room airport: an updated arrivals hall with a mechanical carousel a communal departure area serving the 4 or 6 gates (glass doors really) that lead to the tarmac separated by the small warm somewhat chaotic check-in area. Some staff were friendly and enthusiastic security checks were minimal. Few large jets come to BZE but they do seem to be timed near each other. Most flights are prop planes to the interior and the offshore reefs. There is a pleasant open air deck that allows views of arriving and departing passengers walking to and from their planes. There is nothing else to do while waiting for your flight. Bring a book. Amenities are few: tiny gifts shops snack bars and a cafeteria. A good place to people watch. Very stress-free and it serves its purpose. Ambergris Cay was our real destination. Well worth the trip!,POSITIVE
Bellingham,airport,J Pitalo,1/1/2020,Thank you for your kind service. My elderly parents flew out and the patience and attention to their comfort was impressive and appreciative. They contacted me upon their arrival and both were very calm and satisfied. They have been worried about flying- days coming into it. All that went away at the airport in Bellingham. They were greeted upon their arrival at their destination with the necessary extra services. Thank you so much.,POSITIVE
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,30 reviewsAndre Souza,3/23/2018,"CNF-GRU-MAO. So I had a very early flight bound to Manaus, paying extra for hotel was not worth it, so I decided to sleep here. The airport has being refurbished so there is a brand new section, the information is clear and the lines are always small and after you get your boarding pass you can go through security and you will be very safe. Cleaning staff are friendly and will even tell you the best spots to sleep. They have chairs without armrests and cushioned seats. The food is horribly expensive and everything closes at 10pm. There is this good acai shop outside the check in area, coxinhas and acai shakes are great there.",POSITIVE
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,L Praca,12/6/2016,"As I live in Belo Horizonte, this is the most used airport by me. Before the renovation, this airport was very bad, but now, after the renovation, it looks great, it is clean, the queue time is good, there are many options for shopping and eating and the airport is spacious. The only problem is that it is far from Belo Horizonte city centre.",POSITIVE
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Joaquim Coelho,12/18/2014,"I flew a couple of times this year into Belo Horizonte's Confins International airport and I must say that this airport lacks the basics. It was supposed to be renovated for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a few weeks before the tournament the airport was in utter chaos. It seemed as if I was in a construction sight. I came back during the World Cup and things improved a little giving it a more pleasant atmosphere. I am Brazilian so the language is not a problem but I spoke with some people that passed through the airport and they complained how few people spoke English. The airport does not receive many international flights. Only flights are to Buenos Aires-Argentina Miami-USA Lisboa-Portugal and Panama City-Panama and only a few of those are daily. Most of the times I arrived to this airport were on domestic flights but in July I came from the USA using a Copa Airlines flight from Panama City. I was puzzled as to why the plane did not parked directly at the gate since it arrived early in the morning and there were many finger gates with no planes parked whatsoever. Immigration officials were not friendly and showed little professionalism the lady that checked my passport had one earphone on and was chewing gum with her mouth open. The luggage carrousel is a complete mess as the area is very cramped and small. Customs was the only positive as once I had my luggage I went through it quickly. This airport has very bad air conditioning and in the summer it can be horribly hot inside and having to wait to board with very little seating can be a hassle. It is really far from downtown Belo Horizonte but the roads are good and I recommend taking the ""Conexão Aeroporto"" buses that take you straight to the center of the city for a rate of R$ 21 (around 10 dollars). This option is very advantageous because taking a cab directly from the airport is ridiculously expensive. Have seen worse airports but this one is one that I am certainly not very fond of. Does it's job but could be far off better and I hope it does get better once the renovations are finished.",NEGATIVE
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,N Junzo,12/18/2011,Confins looks like a bus station rather than an international airport. Poor services bad signage extremely high prices and depressing overcrowded waiting areas close to the boarding gates. Catering and shopping options inside security area are very limited so make sure to replenish yourselves before proceeding to it.,NEGATIVE
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Y Bert,1/7/2011,I haven't seen much progress the airport still looks quite old. The prices of food and drinks are extremely high compared to prices in Belo Horizonte and the public transportation (buses) to Belo Horizonte aren't efficient for an airport aiming to be international. Good points : waiting times aren't too long and free parking facilities just in front of the terminal.,NEUTRAL
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Antonio Ferreira,9/6/2010,"The new ""linha verde"" - green line was a very good improvement in this airport access; all the journey now takes about 35 minutes in express way. Even with more and more passengers increase month a month it's still lacking international 3 cities (Miami Lisbon and Panama City) are directly connected. The baggage claim is a problem: only 1 is located in international area (and is very small and you must wait a lot of time until you get your baggage).",POSITIVE
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,A Hijmans,4/19/2010,"One of Brazil's better airports although its design is stark and gloomy - though airy. Used aforementioned ""Conexio Aeroporto"" bus service to get there: punctual fast and good quality. Food wise all the usual airport restaurants are here but on the third floor to the left is a real find if you want real food and you're on a budget: the Restaurante Social looks like a university canteen but serves palatable food at non-airport prices.",POSITIVE
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,A Hetier,12/7/2009,"I concur with the comment below Confins is under-used.

Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Andre Bomtempo,6/30/2006,The new Highway (Linha Verde) connecting the Airport to Downtown Belo Horizonte will definitely help with the distance issue. The Airport itself is modern and well maintained. But I think it has potential that’s not being used. The lack of international flights is another problem. Most flights have connections in Rio or SP making BH hours farther then it really is. It could take less than 10 hours from New York but with the connections it takes about 15 hours if we are lucky enough to find a flight from Rio or SP. Hopefully with the “Industrial Airport” more international flights will start to be available we’ll see.,NEUTRAL
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Giovanni Guidi,6/2/2006,Very badly located and designed airport. The check-in areas are outside (it doesn't rain but it can be very hot) the airport is too far away from the city (no fast connections as well). In terms of services it has banks restaurants newsagents cash machines and a post office. There is no internet access for passengers which is ridiculous for the third biggest airport in Brazil. I had to send an urgent business email and had to beg the local administration office (on the top floor of the terminal) to use one of their computers for 5 minutes. Thanks to the good nature of most of the Brazilian people this was allowed (saving me from a lot of problems) but if the management is willing to put mobile phones rechargers in the terminal (I could see they were available for everyone for free) they could also make the effort to put a couple of internet access points.,NEGATIVE
Benghazi,airport,Peter Thackray,4/19/2010,"Flew from Tripoli to Benghazi. Extremely small airport but very speedy. Bus from aircraft to Arrivals ""Shed"" which was about 300m from the plane. A single Baggage Reclaim Belt that was open to anyone from arriving passengers to well-wishers and anyone else. No obvious security but a couple of guards. Departures domestically was a similar affair with a perfunctory scan of hand luggage and a check of Boarding Pass which then had to receive a Stamp from another person before being lead into a seating area with a small place selling drinks and snacks and toilet and Prayer Room. Boarding was females first then male passengers by bus to the plane waiting on the tarmac. Very few aircraft movements so departure was as soon as boarding was completed.",NEUTRAL
Bengkulu,airport,3 reviewsRafael Suarez,6/27/2018,"I traveled to Bengkulu, Indonesia to visit friends for the first time in November 2017. Flew on Lion Air. Upon arriving at the airport we deplane using stairs and walked on the tarmac to the arrival building. It was late afternoon with the sun just about to set. The airport building is very quaint. Nice outdoor gardens greet you and on the day I arrived a nice afternoon breeze. Slowly make the way to the inside of the terminal where one luggage belt, half inside the terminal and a portion outside the terminal awaits. The luggage eventually arrives and it gives you time to see the pictures of some of the sights to see in Bengkulu. Once luggage in hand you go outside where there are various options for transport to where ever you are going. I was met by friends that took me to the hotel. Two weeks later, I left Bengkulu and experienced the departure area. You go through the usual security immediately upon entering the terminal, (say your good byes outside the door,) then walk to the check in desk where you obtain your boarding pass and check your luggage. English is not widely spoken at the airport if at all, but I had no issues whatsoever. You then go to the gate area, nice seats, air conditioned, tv's, bathrooms, and probably restaurants though I left on the first flight out and I not see anything to buy food or drinks. Eventually they called the flight, once again no English, and we boarded the same way, nice walk outside to the waiting aircraft. All in all a really nice experience in this airport.",POSITIVE

Bergen,airport,M McMillen,5/30/2023,Poor wheelchair assistance on departure and arrival. Departure was worse as I really needed a wheelchair to get me to the gate. Was told to wait at a particular spot and if no one showed by 3 PM that I should probably try to make it on my own. Well 3 PM came and I hobbled as best as I could to the gate.

Never traveling to this airport again.,NEGATIVE

Bergen,airport,A Sims,9/23/2019,This airport was very disappointing and frustrating to say the least. Our original flight was canceled and rebooked for the next day at 6am. We had problems checking in and locating the gate since it was not located on the departure board. We couldn’t find one person working after leaving security. It was like the airport was deserted. Security told us the gate would be in “E somewhere”. We heard by passenger word of mouth which gate it would be. I will not be using this airport again.,NEGATIVE
Bergen,airport,C Huang,8/4/2019,"Terrible service, security staff totally not efficient. I bought some stuff and had to do some tax refund, the tax forms said that I had to show the purchased items when requesting the refund. The problem was that the refund point was after security control so I could not go in with my luggage. I asked the security how to deal with that and they said send the lugagge and go in with your stuff. So I did that, but I was stopped because I was carrying a tube with cod roe which I had to throw even though I discussed with security that I did what I was told by his colleague. Had to give up the stuff I purchased legally because the staff did not tell me how to proceed correctly. First of all, tax refund point should be before security check, second thing is that the tax refund forms say that I had to show the items, but the security guys did not tell me that, because of their ineficiency I had to throw my purchase for nothing. I even asked for complaint forms and they did not give me that, that's why I am writting this review, to express my totally disappointment against a totally unacceptable way of doing things, i understand is their duty to comply with security protocol, but don't tell me to bring the stuff inside if you are not 100% sure that it will go in. First time I am so disgusted in an airport, felt I threw my money for nothing, thanks God the product was not an expensive one, but besides that their attitude was totally not professional.",NEGATIVE
Bergen,airport,M Wallis,5/27/2019,"So few options for food when you have entered the departure area. But the most annoying thing was a guy asking your opinion of the airport (asking while eating, not awaiting your answer while your mouth was full of food) and all you had to enter was your personal information (birth, address, activity at destination etc) and not even one possibility to rate the facilities or anything of Bergen Airport. They were just shamelessly collecting private information.",NEGATIVE
Bergen,airport,P Thackray,2/20/2018,"New airport building opened in August 2017. Large and airy construction gives a positive feeling to airport experience. International Arrivals involve a bit of walking to the Baggage Reclaim and International Arrivals which happen on the ground floor. Car Rental, Café and Bureau de Change all within the terminal building. Bus, Taxi and Tram are out by the front door. Undercover walkways connect to short stay car parks. Departures are on the 1st floor with the usual automated check-in. Security pretty quick with more capacity when things get busy. The Departure Lounge overlooks the end of the runway and has air bridges to most departure gates - some bus departures for small aircraft parked remotely. Good selection of shops and cafes. A big improvement on the old terminal building.",NEUTRAL

Bergen,airport,Peter Thackray,12/13/2016,"A relatively small but busy airport serving a key city on the coast of Norway. Most flights are domestic within Norway. Domestic Arrivals mix with departures and there are 2 baggage belts on the ground floor behind the check-in desks, no specific separation between general public and flying public. On the ground floor there are 2 convenience shops selling snacks, drinks etc and a small café/bar. The Check-in is predominantly self-service with very few staff evident. Upstairs to Security and Departures. The main domestic departures has a few food outlets, a book shop and a convenience shop, there is a further section for International Travellers with full Duty Free options. Most planes land at a gate with pier so little need to be outside. No announcements or ""Last Calls"" are made so you need to look at one of the many monitors to check your flight status.

I spent minutes contemplating how I was shortly destined to be walking round London with my trousers falling down because I didn't have my belt on. As we were summoned to the gate I was overjoyed to hear an announcement from Bergerac Airport or Ryanair saying that my belt had been found. I am so happy, I feel moved to thank, and complement whichever staff or system meant that I was reunited with my belt. Well done.",POSITIVE

Bergerac,airport,W Mitchell,5/20/2017,"My two sons arrived on a flight in the pouring rain, the flight had arrived ten minutes after the Ryanair Stansted flight had touched down. So two full flights and two passport control officials trying to deal with two full flights of possibly around 300 people. I waited 90 minutes from the time my boys flight landed to the time they got through passport control. Absolutely ridiculous. They stood in the pouring rain because there was no room under the 'hangar' of an arrivals hall. My sons could have flown to Bordeaux which is 70 minutes from our home and we would have been home quicker travelling 70 mins, than me sitting in the carport for 90 minutes waiting for them to come through. Bergerac airport had better wake up and smell the coffee and realise you can not treat passengers like this. They are not cattle and security checks are carried out heavily in the UK so why on earth they have to interrogate every passenger that arrives? One family of four took ten minutes to answer questions. Bergerac can not possibly compete with the other international airports in France unless it changes its attitude and builds a better hall for arriving passengers. Their car park is being heavily invested in only to make money from people needing to park their cars there. Start to invest in a better arrivals hall, more staff and a better carousel for the suitcases, otherwise they are going to lose passengers who would prefer to travel to Bordeaux or even Toulouse. Please get your act together Bergerac!",NEGATIVE
Bergerac,airport,R Vines,5/6/2017,"It's a small airport with the most basic of facilities, but there were no delays in either direction. I hope that means they have sorted out immigraton, though it may be that my BA flight from London City arrived at a quiet time. My only gripe is about one woman on security who was quite unfriendly when she told me I had to return to check-in because she didn't like the look of a vase I had in my carry-on bag. Otherwise, the staff seemed quite friendly.",POSITIVE
Bergerac,airport,Lynda Lawlor,4/29/2017,"Once again, Bergerac have failed to provide any passenger comfort with long delays at arrivals because of increased security measures. Whilst we all understand the need for this, why is it impossible for the airport to lay on extra staff? I was approximately half way along the queue and waited 1hr and 40 minutes to get to the control booth on 11th April. Meanwhile, one lady had to face the embarrassment of asking to jump the queue as she urgently needed the toilet. I have written to this airport before pointing out the need for a toilet at arrivals airside, especially when there are delays. I have never received a reply, which is both rude and suggests a complete lack of respect for customer welfare. I found this review page by trying to find any kind of information for a flight I will be meeting this coming Sunday. So far I can find no information on how long the arrivals delay is likely to be.",NEGATIVE
Bergerac,airport,B Kleinveld,10/2/2016,"I went to meet someone off the flight from Brussels and he took 45 minutes to get through passport control. This happens all the time since security has been on high alert (can understand that). However, the airport should put more people on the passport control in order to get passengers through quicker. I shall be flying to London next Jan and again in March and I know it will be a long wait to get through - ridiculous.",NEGATIVE
Bergerac,airport,B Smith,6/19/2016,Bergerac is a very small airport but still with major deficiencies. Immigration checks have been stepped up which I do not have a problem with. The problem lies with insufficient staff. Arriving on a full aircraft there are only 2 officials who carefully examine every passport and manually enter the details on their system. This is a very slow process and results in very long queues stretching outside onto the apron of the airport. Not very nice in either very hot or wet weather as there is no shelter from the elements. It can take up to 45 minutes to clear the arrivals hall. Cleary more customs officers are need and some form of shelter for the queue.,NEGATIVE
Bergerac,airport,Michael Souter,7/15/2013,I was looking forward to using Bergerac Airport for the first time. But the experience was dreadful. I thought it would be much quicker to check in and go through security. But it was the worst airport I have experienced. There was only one person most of the time checking in the flight who was spending a ridiculous amount of time in each passenger. As a frequent flyer I know of no other airport where every single carry on bag is checked in. Security is over zealous checking in more detail than any other airport I have ever visited. It was a horrible experience which spoilt my visit to the Dordogne.,NEGATIVE
Bergerac,airport,Richard Lindsay,6/24/2013,This airport is small so whilst access is good facilities are very limited. Airside there are only 2-3 vending machine so if you want anything to eat or drink best use the bar Landside. Do not carry tins (eg Duck Confit Pate etc) that are greater than 100g in hand luggage - they will be confiscated at security.,NEUTRAL
Bergerac,airport,S Gaudicheau,6/6/2010,Arrival was great. I was at passport control within 2 minutes of landing. On the way back it was another story. I couldn't do the online check in and I found out at the airport that it's not provided when you fly from Bergerac. You have to queue with everybody in order to get your boarding pass even if you only have hand luggage. Ground personnel very slow until the call was made to invite people for boarding. They then suddenly were very quick. The toilets aren't provided with coat or handbag hangers which I find not practical.,NEUTRAL
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Katharina Holzle,12/2/2024,"Besides an airport that is not user-friendly designed (too many stairs, unfriendly environment), the security check is an absolute nightmare. And it is getting worse day by day. Yesterday it took me 45 minutes to go through check-in because on Sunday evening they had only three check-in counters open. I went to T2 and cut various corners, otherwise it would not have been possible to reach my flight in time. The only good thing about T2 is that you do not have to take everything out because at T1, I have experienced several times over the last weeks that they check everything in your carry-on luggage. They take Christmas cookies away, they take presents away, they are slow, unfriendly, and it makes me feel so ashamed to be a German because of this. It's a disgrace for the German capitol. All international travellers (and Germans as well) are embarrassed of the way they are working there. If you can, try not to use this airport.",NEGATIVE
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,C Kaymon,10/15/2024,"Absolutely one of the worst international airport I have experienced and I have been to many airports all over the world.  On arrival passport control took another hour with just 3 then 4 out of 7 counters occupied and only EU citizens allowed to use the very poorly marked eGates (yet we allow Germans to use the eGates in New Zealand and Australia). Our luggage took two hours to appear with no reasons given for the delay other than a repeating message that due to operational issues it was delayed (no sh*t sherlock). Departing from that airport was even worse. After fighting Berlin traffic to get out of the city check in, passport and X-Ray officials were particularly unhelpful. Access to the gates was super confusing with one area closed off with no clear signage where to go. The layout on airside is a debacle. Restaurants and shops are miles to walk to with no conveyor belts. The ceiling is so low and dark it feels really oppressive. Terrible airport. If they had kept Berlin Tegel open as a city airport they would have seen that people and airlines would have refused to use the new one, but as it is Berlin travellers are stuck with that Albert Speeresque monstrosity miles outside the city.",NEGATIVE
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Geoff Painter,9/30/2024,"After over 50 years of air travel, and twenty transatlantic return flights, I experienced the worst check in and airport experience at Berlin Brandenburg in September 2024. My wife and I completed the online check in but that proved to be of little help as it provided us with no means of obtaining the necessary Baggage tags for us to use the bag drop procedure. With minimal staff available, and a long line of people requiring help in fully checking in, we lined up for over an hour before we were able to check our bags. We then lined up for 45 minutes I'm order to go through security. The treatment we received going through security was appalling. My wife and I are not fluent German speakers and when we did not immediately fully understand the instructions, they were simply repeated louder and in a very exasperated tone. We were then thoroughly frisked iand required to take up pistures difficult for those in their seventies. It felt as though we were being punished and the hostility was palpable. Throughout Berlin Brandenburg the lack of Lufthansa staff to respond to inquiries was a problem and we were unable to get necessary information about our connecting Lufthansa flight. The signage in the airport is very poor especially for those arriving at the Flughafen Berlin railway station and there were no staff around to help people. I'm future we will avoid Berlin Brandenburg and use a different airline than Lufthansa.",NEGATIVE

The way this airport was designed is inefficient causing long lines at security. It's a nightmare to watch how slow the entire process works. Security staff on all three occasions have been rude despite us speaking German, making sure to lecture us in one way or another. It took an hour and a half to go through it and if our flight hadn't been delayed, we would certainly have missed it. We travel a lot on business and Berlin must be the worst airport we have ever experienced. As we have to return to Berlin at some time, we are flying into Hamburg in the future to avoid Berlin Brandenburg. It was a disaster even before the delayed opening and if they don't change the staff's attitude nor security layout and operation, it should be shut down again.",NEGATIVE
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Stephen Cooper,9/13/2024,"We have used the new BER airport a couple of times and overall experience is sub-par for a new airport.

Whilst being new the airport is not particularly pleasing aesthetically compared to other major airports. As a capital airport it lags behind many other airports, Changi, Munich, Hamad etc. Should be much better.

This could be tolarable if the security after passport control didn't have an attitude problem. I've flown in twice now and both times have been treated awfully for no reason. The most recent experience with them left me in tears. I get to security and the man checking through my liquids etc at the entrance spoke in English and was friendly enough. Then I had to go through the standing scanner machine and a woman held up her hand as if to tell me to wait and said something in German, so I just stood there until she signalled for me to come forward. Then she started talking to me again but didn't signal or move her hand to come forward or anything, so I went ''I'm sorry, I don't understand'' and she abruptly said (in English), ''where are you from'', I told her the UK, then she went, ''you are in Germany, so you ask me, speak English please.'' I just looked at her confused and replied ''Should I come through or?'' then again in English repeated 'You are in Germany, so you ask me please if you want me to speak in english''. I replied, ''okay''. She looked at me in disgust then she waved me through, I did the scanner then she started really roughly giving me a pat down, pulling my top out because it was tucked into my jeans, pulling at my waist, I was just standing there like, wow, what is happening.

Flying from this airport made me feel like flying back to the normal world while coming from a 3rd world country. Holes in the road to the airport, no nice place to eat something, and a very very poor departure terminal. Actually the only good thing there was, was the wifi connection which was surprisingly good. Other than that, nothing nice to say about this airport. A real shame for Berlin and for Germany.",NEGATIVE
Berlin Schonefeld,airport,G Garbutt,4/6/2020,"Was disappointed by the lack of space and the blandness of the terminal arriving and departing from this airport located in a capital city. I've been in and out of non-primary regional domestic airports which are far more impressive. I would've opted for Berlin Tegel if available. This airport is not as convenient as it is further away from the city centre. No seating in the pre-check-in greeting area. No shelter going to and coming from the car park. Very noticeable when the weather is bad as it was when I was there. There was a convenience style shop which was quite well stocked but nothing exceptional by way of gifts. In the post-check-in area, the hallways are very narrow and tiny and hard seats are either to be found in a long row along the corridor or in tiny boxes around the departure gate. Airport lounge was not worth the bother. Shopkeepers only spoke German even after speaking English to them first. Passport clearance consisted of only one booth for the 100 or so passengers boarding and again a very narrow passage. Baggage collection was quite quick but this is probably because of how tiny the terminal was. The distance from the plane to passport control then baggage collection is so short and badly signposted that you could easily overlook that you are actually in the correct baggage claim area. The airport app was not very appealing and the wifi signal weak.",NEGATIVE
Berlin Schonefeld,airport,J Wilkin,2/8/2020,"The security staff were incredibly slow and seemed to be more interested in personal chats than getting customers through the security process as quickly as possible.

Berlin Schonefeld,airport,Ksenia Posadskova,1/15/2020,I was flying outside of the EU and having the non-EU passport I waited more than an hour in a narrow corridor to go over the passport checks.

Berlin Tegel,airport,1 reviewsW Edwards,9/18/2020,"Treat the travellers terribly. Insisted on one bag per person on your journey on the plane. Even when you paid for 2 on your outward journey. They have everyone queuing outside the airport to get in, yet the departures lounge is the size of a parrots cage. They offer very little duty free and have one unit selling hot drinks and food resulting in rip off prices. Overall the staff are bullish and downright rude.",NEGATIVE
Berlin Tegel,airport,Tim Leborgne,2/24/2020,I believe Tegel is one of the worst airports I have visited in Europe. Its organisation is uselessly complicated (how many security check areas do they have - one for each 2 to 5 gates? How can that be financially viable? The wait times and queuing are ridiculous. The staff are unfriendly and unhelpful. The amenities outside and inside the airport are truly lacking (No smoking areas inside! Smokers with a long wait need to exit the airport).,NEGATIVE
Berlin Tegel,airport,3 reviewsEthan Phua,1/10/2020,"Berlin Tegel is a very unique airport, both is positive and negative ways. After arriving at Berlin Tegel and disembarking the aircraft, we had to queue up on the jetbridge as the customs checkpoint was right after the jetbridge. A very interesting concept. Right after that was a small baggage carousel, then out of the departures area. This meant that there was basically no departures area. We had to wait quite some time for our baggage. When we returned to to the airport, our check-in process was pretty smooth and the lounge was easily accessible. There was a huge observation deck which spanned the roof of a terminal, offering beautiful views of the runway and tarmac, a good place to spend the time. However, you have to go through a small security check and buy a ticket before entering. Every two gates had its own departure area with seats and its own security checkpoint. This meant snaking queues into the public area each time a flight was boarding, and it was hard to walk around with baggage because there was little space. Inside the tiny departures area, there was insufficient seating and insufficient space for the boarding queue. Everyone was squeezed at the gate and there was absolutely no order or anything. No queues set up.",NEUTRAL
Berlin Tegel,airport,F Andrews,12/28/2019,"Worst out of the worst. Staff are not helpful, they are slow and unkind. Avoid if you can. I travel to this airport about 6-8 times a year and every time it is as bad as it was before.",NEGATIVE

The toilets are partly out of order and extremely dirty, you can see at every corner that the cleaning costs are extremely saved. All in all, it is infinitely embarrassing to present a “cosmopolitan city” like Berlin, those responsible should be ashamed! | Der Flughafen ist dem eines Hauptstadtflughafens in keiner Weise angemessen, es unfassbar dreckig, die Organisation ist eine absolute Katastrophe (nach der Landung stehen die Transportbusse zwar am Flugzeug bereit aber es dauerte geschlagene 30 Minuten bis man es geschafft hat wenigstens 1 Rolltreppe zum Flugzeug zu bringen).

Berlin Tegel,airport,K Pearce,12/11/2019,"Awful experience! I am a very frequent (business) traveller and have seen a lot of airports in the world. But this one exceeded my worst nightmares. We were in the line for the security check to Amsterdam, combined with Paris. We had over 1 hour to go through security for Amsterdam (Paris flight had 30 min), but it took ages! Only one gate was open (another one was idle, no personnel). The guy performing the screening was taking all the time in the world as if we were not in a hurry. Personnel were very unfriendly, yelling at us. Paris passengers were really getting worried they could not make their flight. The screening guy did not notice this. In the end, someone called all the Paris passengers to the front, which upset the screening guy very much. He really flipped and sent back the passengers to the end of the line. When we started complaining about this ridiculous situation, the guy even stopped the scanner and called the airport police! He deliberately stopped the process to make us miss the flight. After 10 minutes the police came and we could explain the situation. They checked our passports and convinced the screening guy to start checking again. We barely made our flight. It was the worst airport nightmare of my life! Never again Berlin Tegel. It is a disgrace for the Germany capital, a country that has the name of being well organised and 'pünktlich'. I advise them to check out Schiphol Amsterdam for a much better experience!",NEGATIVE

Berlin Tegel,airport,Hoi Wong,12/7/2019,"Me and my family just arrived today and had the worst experience ever in the Berlin Tegel airport. First of all, the queue of immigration was terribly long and we waited for an hour and a half just to go through immigration. Once we got through the immigration me and my brother got our baggage but my mum’s baggage went missing, so we waited till there was no baggage on the belt anymore. I called the “missing or damaged baggage” but no one picked up. Then I saw staff with a bright green vest so I went to her for help. But the answer she gave me was: missing baggage is not my area, don’t ask me is not my business, then she walked away quickly. I was standing there feeling helpless then I saw the sign of baggage service, so me and my family went there for help. The staff there asked me to fill in a form and wait till they have any news. We are really worried so I ask her when exactly can we get back our baggage, she replied she didn’t know. We felt the answer she gave was really unhelpful so we went to the customer service counter, I told the guy at the desk that my mum has health issues and all of her medicine is in the baggage, then he replied that’s not his problem because my mum shouldn’t have put the medicine in that bag in the first place. He was really rude and judgemental since the reason my mum didn’t take the medicine out of the bag is that the cabin bag was supposed to be taken onboard by herself but the easyJet staff told her that the plane has not got enough space so they had to check in her cabin bag. My mum has all of her heart medicine, sleeping pills and antidepressant in her baggage. Now my mum might have to fly back to the UK since she has been in serious health condition for over 10 years.",NEGATIVE

Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Peter Cullen,9/24/2008,I used Tempelhof for the first (and I guess last) time last week. It is wonderful - why are modern airports not like this? The history and architecture are fabulous of course but it also works incredibly well - admittedly having so few flights means nothing is really under pressure. As noted elsewhere public transport links are excellent one can be in the city centre within 15 minutes of walking off the plane. From the departure lounge to seat on the aircraft takes less than a minute. I guess it is an anachronism in the 21st century but it is sad to say goodbye to an airport with real character.,NEGATIVE
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Lisa Sanders,6/6/2008,Templehof is a dream. The architecture is beautiful and the departure hall is stunning. Some of the original features can be found a true jewel. It oozes nostalgia and would be a tragedy to lose such a wonderful piece of history. The most civilised journey I've embarked on to date was Templehof to Brussels.,POSITIVE
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,W Wynants,12/16/2007,This post World War II airbridge landmark is probably the best airport location worldwide. Nowadays it is called Zentral Flughafen and that is because the U-bahn is only a 3-minute walk . From here it only takes minutes to get anywhere in the city. The terminal is completely outdated but very charming: Planes park literally in the terminal and boarding and deboarding happen always dry thanks to the roof of the hangar. The toilets are clean there is a delishop/bar and all major car rental companies have a desk. Unfortunately THF is not smoke free passengers still smoke in the smoking area of the already small waiting areas at the gates.,POSITIVE
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Matthew Ross,11/16/2007,Very convenient for the city centre. Unfortunately there are a limited number of routes (but Brussels Airlines offers a good service several times per day). The advantage is that the airport is uncrowded - at times almost deserted. I regret that it is now living on borrowed time. There is a Berlin Underground (U-Bahn) station nearby but there are quite a few steps - so it is difficult for passengers travelling with luggage let alone disabled travellers.,NEUTRAL
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Lars Dunn,3/29/2006,I was surprised when I arrived at Berlin Tempelhof how small the airport was. However the facilities are there although in a small scale and the airport is relatively clean and friendly. Not a bad airport just a bit out of date.,POSITIVE
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Declan Bourke,11/8/2005,I travelled from Berlin Tempelhof on 5/11/05. I arrived at the airport at 8.30 for a 10.55 flight. I have never experienced a more chaotic airport. When I finally cleared the initial security screening and checked in for my flight I commenced queuing once more the queue which was very slow became absolutely chaotic when people entered the queue from the sides and no airport staff or security staff intervened. The entire experience showed a level of inability in the security or airport staff to ensure orderly queuing and safety of passengers. I will be very reluctant to use this airport again.,NEGATIVE
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Jens Mueller,3/21/2005,Oldest airport that is still in use but great! The mother of all airports has an impressive architecture huge size and is very close to the city.

Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Hans Berschneider,4/14/2004,Tempelhof is Berlin's pre WWII airport and is one of the older operational airports in Europe It's an arrchitectural treasure.

Unfortunately they are going to shut it down in the next few years because of lack of travel demand and because it is in the located in the middle of a densely populated residential area.,POSITIVE
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Mark Evans,10/31/2003,One for the historians of airport architecture a real time-warp from the 1960s and earlier. This was the original pre-WW2 Berlin airport. The paucity of flights serving Tempelhof make for a very stress-free environment. Emerging from the terminal one finds oneself in an ordinary residential street the facade of the terminal blending in with the neighbouring apartment blocks. The U-Bahn station is just 300 m away and one is in the heart of Berlin cheaply and in double-quick time. But look again at that facade towards the top: there's a gap. Wasn't that where the old regime's notorious symbol used to stand?,NEUTRAL
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Christian Seefeldt,10/30/2003,Easy to get there - free parking just in front of it - super fast check in and so on. It took me 10 minutes from the moment I parked my car to the lounge. Highly recommended. The only problem is nearly no flights leaving here !!,POSITIVE
Bermuda,airport,R Goyette,5/27/2024,"We have flown twice into Bermuda and each time were in/out in under 30 minutes! For an island of just 64,000 residents (2024), I am mightily impressed. We really appreciated the smiling and welcoming airport staff, along with the friendly curbside taxi operators. The new terminal is quite impressive, and the signage reflects what is commonly used in other international airports. The duty free shops, sadly, offer no bargain prices. In fact, alcohol products are cheaper in Hamilton. Yes, the food offerings in the terminal are quite limited, but they do attempt to reflect local culinary tastes. While local favorites are mostly featured, the prices are high, but generally commensurate with elsewhere on the island. In fact, prices are definitely comparable to any of the NY area airports FACT CHECK: Bermuda is an island that largely relies on marine shipments of imported food and supplies (including oil, and gas). Closing Thought: I have circled the globe and, on reflection, choose L F Wade airport as my preferred southern transit stop!",POSITIVE
Bermuda,airport,T Shuler,7/2/2021,"International Airport? What a joke. Although new, this airport is lacking in accommodations and facilities for travelers. For example, there's only 1 place to get anything to eat or drink in the entire airport. Stand in a Long line to order 2 burgers n fries, chips, and two drinks for $125.00! For that you can enjoy a 3 course meal at 5 star Ascots for two. Or, you can feast on a huge Sunday Brunch at Fourways for $120 for two. I've included photos of the restaurant poster, and then of the Real restaurant. Only 4 items actually offered- none from their poster. There is one shop, which closes at 4pm. There are very few travel supplies typical of any other airport. They claim that the shop is duty free, but liquor prices are higher than in town. Do not expect any common airport facilities other than this. If more than 1 plane arrives or departs at the same time, expect a backup at every stage of your experience. Honestly, I've had better accommodation and service at regional airports handling local traffic and single engine planes. Bermuda is an extremely friendly, welcoming, and inviting country with Much to offer any traveler. What a shame that the Airport authority leaves a holiday traveler with such a ugly parting view. Clean up your act, folks. It's embarrassing.",NEGATIVE
Bermuda,airport,Andy Magowan,5/29/2016,"Arrival. What can I say? This airport is small. I arrived on a Monday evening on a BA 777. Also just arrived was an AA 737. The arrival hall is small, very small. Add to this there were only three immigration desks open. I think the wait was around an hour. Add to that the distinct lack of seating. It was a chore. The surroundings were pleasant enough, but standing for an hour with nothing to do but shuffle forward at the pace of a one legged gnat, was nothing less than a chore. Departure. My transfer to BDA got me there at around a quarter past 6am. Unfortunately the check in desks don't open until around 7am, but at least there was seating. Lines were short and once check in opened I was able to get through check in and clear U.S customs in around 15 minutes. The departure lounge has a couple of reasonably priced eateries and a pretty spacious seating area with wifi and mobile/tablet charging stations. There was also a nice floor to ceiling windowed area at one end with a good view of the apron and runway. In short, a decent little airport, albeit let down with a horrid arrivals area",NEUTRAL
Bermuda,airport,E Williams,7/3/2014,"This airport is horrible on the arrival side and barely passable on the departure side. On both the airport management should look into ""jetways.""

Rude passport control officer. Extremely rude customs officer - she pawed through all my belongings being careful to disarrange them untidily. Then to the greeting area - no chairs to sit in while awaiting my pickup. Entire area filthy. By now I needed a bathroom a janitor directed me to one ""around the corner"" near a loading dock. It smelt of urine and was crawling with ants. Departure: confusing signage shops too few and overpriced at gate (upper level) one goes down a flight of stairs in order to go up a flight of stairs into the airplane. (At the bottom of the flight of stairs some sort of janitor screamed at me to show my passport. Oh well I suppose the boarding process needs more inefficiency. All flights in-&-out were delayed 90 minutes because that morning the radar was ""inoperative.""

Bermuda,airport,Bertram Forbes,1/29/2007,Bermuda's airport and Bermuda generally could be much more a pleasurable experience if it's government got rid of some nasty aspects of Bermuda for American British Canadian and European tourists. I refer to the mere $100 in duty-free allowances it offers its own residents compared to $800 allowed in the USA - and only $35 allowed by Bermuda in duty- free allowances to tourists. These token allowances are cheap and nasty make the government look greedy and uncaring are rigorously applied and when residents or visitors bring in more a 30% duty applies.,NEGATIVE
Bermuda,airport,Raymond Breland,4/20/2005,"Like Bermuda itself this airport is a thoroughly civilized experience - not very busy so not crowded with a rather predictable traffic pattern of arrivals and departures. Facilities are very adequate and the duty-free shop has a reasonable variety albeit a bit expensive. On entry customs officials are polite and welcoming. When checking in for our departing flight the official who had to ""pat me down"" for a follow-up security check (the machine beeped when I went through) apologized for having to do so and thanked me for accommodating the security process! All in all a refreshingly unique experience - one that is alas vanishing amid the all-too-common post 9/11 over-zealous and ironically ineffective security measures elsewhere - Bravo to Bermuda and its airport!!",POSITIVE
Berne,airport,Paul Van Alsten,6/26/2010,ORY-BRN with Air France and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus connection with Berne central station upon each regular incoming and departing flight - one-way costs 5.20CHF. Check-in efficient and hassle-free - online check-in has now been introduced.

Bhubaneswar,airport,Prasad Vinnakota,9/27/2010,We were travelling from Bhubaneshwar to Hyderabad recently. The airport was clean and nice but was shocked a little later at the security at this airport. While we were flying a person behind my row was complained about dripping water. The stewardess was puzzled and checked the luggage rack. There was this bag belonging to a passenger that contained a bottle of water that leaked drenching all the bags in that part before trickling down on the heads of people below. Note that this is a colored rectangular serrated bottle and not one of those branded mineral water bottles sold inside the secure zone. Also note that the passenger was able-bodied. It is clear that the security checks simply waved the bottle past. Having travelled from Newark to Hyderabad via Mumbai and suffering innumerable checks and having spent a small fortune on buying water inside the secure zone I was shocked at this incident. I suggest that the rules be strictly implemented and a refresher course be held for the personnel.,NEGATIVE

Biarritz,airport,Brian Murphy,8/27/2006,Recently flew to and from Roissy CDG to Biarritz International in the Basque country in south west France for the first time. The airport itself is small but there is a good bus service which will take you into the city centre pretty quickly. On arrival on the 13.00 HRS AF 7638 flight from CDG this flight seemed to coincide with a number of other flights from the UK which made the baggage arrivals area chaotic. In addition the toilet facilities landside need some upgrading and definitely could do with the cleaners visiting there on a more frequent basis especially mid-afternoon which seems to be the peak time for the airport. The rubbish bin in the gents toilet was overflowing when I was there which left a poor initial impression! The airport does have an excellent tourism booth with very helpful staff however. In addition from the airport one can get onto the nearby motorway very quickly and the care hire agencies also had very helpful staff at the airport (especially Europcar). On departing Biarritz back to Paris however I discovered that the departures area has only one very small cafe so passengers may not want to enter this area too quickly as the wait could be long and somewhat boring. In summary the airport is convenient but it falls well short of the new fresher and modern design of nearby Pau airport which is excellent.,NEGATIVE

Arrivals was easy, immigration was quick and at the end of the arrivals lounge is the transit bus to the city centre. 15 minutes from getting of the plane and on a bus into the city. Check in was easy and simple, the only departures terminal has about 20 check in desks in the main hall and queues at security where not to long. The airside shopping is adequate and walking to the furthest gate takes no more than 5 minutes.",POSITIVE
Bilbao,airport,Annette Thomas,9/1/2017,"Because of the items in the news about delays and queues we were quite worried about going to Bilbao airport. We did have to wait a few minutes at passport control but not too long. The airport is a new building, very light and modern, we didn't have to use any steps at all which was brilliant. On our return journey we purchased food and drinks in the cafe, they were nicely prepared and the area was very clean and tidy. All in all a very good experience and the area can be proud of the facilities.",POSITIVE
Bilbao,airport,3 reviewsIgor Bikandi,7/17/2017,Bilbao is not the most comfortable airport - getting to the plane is quite fast (10 minutes maximum) and leaving the airport after landing is fast too (10-20 minutes). You can get to Bilbao by bus (there's a bus each 20-30 minutes).,NEGATIVE
Bilbao,airport,Ryan Oliver,7/16/2017,"Very good experience! Arriving - Plane lands, bags come off quickly and arrive quickly, passport line 5-10 mins maximum with all desks open with very little queues. Departing - All check in desks were open which made it flow quick, security lines were short which means we were through within 5 minutes. Good shops and restaurants available.",POSITIVE
Bilbao,airport,S Parkin,9/17/2014,What a contrast to arrive from the chaos of Stansted. Plane lands bags come off quickly passport line 5-10 mins maximum. Taxis right outside airport arrivals (or bus stop turn right and go to the end of the concourse). My record for checking in at the hotel is 42 mins from the wheels touching the runway. Coming back on Easy Jet last flight out of the night so it's a bit quiet but again you get through quickly. Grab a beer. Don't even bother queuing until you see the incoming plane land and reach the gate. Very relaxed place to fly in and out of.,POSITIVE
Bilbao,airport,Marc Guillemard,7/30/2013,Flew to and from Bilbao. Arrival was quick plane unloaded by Gateway. The building looks nice and is clean. The bad surprise was that we had to wait more than 30 minutes to see the first bag on the belt at a time we were the only plane arriving! I find this unacceptable in big airports and even more in a small one! Departure went well 2 coffees / breakfast facilities everything on time. A pity we got stuck in a bus 20 minutes while the plane was at 3 minutes walk!,NEGATIVE
Bilbao,airport,Anna Kleinzahler,8/7/2012,Flew STN-BIO BIO-STN modern stylish terminal architecture some way outside Bilbao but perhaps the nearest bit of flat land to be found amongst all those hills. No problems on arrival speedy passport check and luggage quickly up on the belt. Same when leaving fact luggage drop and security control. Airport is clean staff friendly and helpful. Minor gripes: no free wi-fi no post office to buy stamps souvenir shop did not have any postcards food and drink air-side expensive lifts seem to have a mind of their own not enough seats on the ground-side. Bilbao well worth a visit even for a day but certainly a weekend.,NEUTRAL
Billund,airport,Thierry Guillaume,6/13/2024,"Simple airport but security check is a joke compared to the 37 other airports I used. A usb cable is considered electronics and is rechecked separately, tooth paste is repacked into a plastic bag. I go through this airport 10 times per year and it is the only one my bags don't go through first pass. Not a single time! Out of these 30 or 40 re-checks of my bags they never found anything wrong. Like I said it is a joke.",NEGATIVE
Billund,airport,Clément Marquis,6/14/2023,"Worst location ever. The airport is far from any city, as if it was a low-cost like Beauvais or Charleroi. 80-90 minutes to reach Aahrus with your car or 105 minutes with a bus. 60 minutes to reach Esbjerg with you car or 80 minutes with a bus. The airport is often dirty.",NEGATIVE
Billund,airport,G Fagirdóttir,9/13/2022,"Firstly there were no family queues, so I had to wait in line for 20 min with two crying 18 month old toddlers. We were not allowed to take the twin stroller upstairs, they said it was to big for the security check, which was wrong, would have gone through easily. Most twin strollers are designed to fit standard doors and a wheelchair bigger then our stroller rolled through easily. But the danish computer says no mentality was not budged. Anyway, we had to hold crying twins and the hand luggage (a lot of luggage comes with two toddlers), while the stroller was folded and marked. After that the guy said “then you take it to the odd size luggage desk”. Yup holding a folded twin stroller while holding a crying toddler is super easy. Going through security (no priority for baby families), we had no place to put the toddlers while taking out electronics, liquid baby food etc. out of the bags so they were running around crying. Finally after coming through security there were some strollers available at the airport (“very nice strollers” as put by the guy that checked us in). There were 6 strollers there, 4 were broken, so we took the two dirty ones that were left. Never ever flying through there with toddlers again!",NEGATIVE
Billund,airport,1 reviewsB Horben,3/5/2020,"There were no people at the airport, it may be due to the Corona virus but they have smiling staff at checkin. I had to wait for a staff, unfortunately, but she was incredibly helpful, calm and smiling. Their security staff may seem a little stiff, this day was not busy, but they still did not have the profits for a smile. However, they must be praised for being very quick to get guests through. This airport had a passenger record a few years ago, with 3 million passengers annually, therefore, they chose to expand the airport. But instead of giving passengers the more space they deserve, they chose instead to expand their very fine lounge, which is never filled, as well as the office for the staff - a disgrace to people who travel a lot. The design of the airport is great even though it is old. as mentioned, the staff are some of the friendliest staff and they are the reason why I love coming here. On a busy day of travel, it is impossible to find a place outside the lounge to sit down.",NEUTRAL
Billund,airport,M Cooper,2/19/2020,"Kind, friendly staff! I was due to travel back to Frankfurt on 9th February when Storm Ciara/Sabine hit Northern and Central Europe. My Lufthansa flight was cancelled before I left for the airport and I was rebooked via text message onto two SAS flights - Billund-Oslo then Oslo-Frankfurt the next day. Unfortunately, after 3/4 hour at the gate on the Monday, my SAS flight was cancelled for technical reasons. There was no SAS rep at the airport so we all had to call their call centre to rebook our flights. I was pretty frustrated but an SAS employee at the call centre was friendly enough when I got through and told me my flight had already been rebooked, though I hadn't had a text message or mail at that time. The Billund airport staff I spoke to couldn't have been friendlier and more helpful. Their hands were tied as they weren't responsible for rebooking our flights but they went out of their way to guide me and fellow passengers. I had had no info from the airline about the chance of booking a hotel/meal vouchers etc. but one kind airport employee took it into his own hands and sorted it all out for me, booking a room and printing a voucher (which they could clearly then redeem from SAS). In short, not much more than an hour after the flight cancellation announcement, I was in an airport hotel room and had time to have dinner and relax before flying the next morning (which all happily worked out). I often fly to and from Billund airport and it's one of my favourites - comfortable, good design, good shops, cafes and restaurants, plenty of seating, perfect view of the runway, etc. Since that day, I've added friendly staff to my list of positives.",POSITIVE
Billund,airport,Eveline Lau,9/2/2013,Travelled from HKG to FRA then to Billund for a business trip. A tiny airport with insufficient facilities. A serious lack of staff while they were not helpful at all already. Self check-in machines available but not enough assistance at all. Medium length queues but moving very slowly.,NEGATIVE
Billund,airport,Christian Britten,9/17/2009,Billund is an excellent airport with good facilities practical layout and friendly and efficient staff. My only gripe is the airport bus which is extortionate (DKK180 to Aarhus) and runs at often perplexing times that seem to have no correlation to when major flights are landing. I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away. As the airport is far from where most foreign travellers want to be (unless they really like Lego) you often have little option but to wait for the bus or pay even more for a taxi.,POSITIVE
Billund,airport,Claus Nielsen,2/19/2009,My favourite airport. Fast efficient and very pleasant. Easy to get to easy to navigate check-in and security is always fast and friendly and the lounge above Security is great. Extremely roomy and classy great for work or relaxation even offers open smoker's cabins that don't feel like a cage - and a chess game for those with plenty of time. Almost everywhere in the airport can you overlook the runway and the whole place is just modern roomy and open. The airport size is an advantage without doubt - the distances between parking check-in security lounge gate and flight are minimal so getting in and out is always a pleasure. Much better than Copenhagen in almost all aspects.,POSITIVE
Billund,airport,Janne Petersson,7/4/2008,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,POSITIVE
Billund,airport,Hanne Eeg Jensen,5/20/2008,"Arrival: Nice short walking distance to baggage claim. Fast baggage delivery. Comfortable smokers lounge next to baggage claim. Relaxed atmosphere; but still very efficient operation. Car rental easy to find - so is the carpark for rented cars. Departure: Easy car return. Clean cheap airport hotel ""fit for purpose"". Several breakfast options in the check-in hall. Easy and friendly check-in. So is security check. I got a feeling that they had though about everything in this airport - and that maybe that is the reason why everything worked so efficiently the staff had energy to smile and the atmosphere is so relaxed.",POSITIVE
Biratnagar,airport,8 reviewsAlok Mishra,6/22/2024,"An airport serving domestic routes in Nepal, capital Kathmandu to the capital of Koshi Pradesh and two other places in the eastern hilly regions. Very basic in services and facilities. IATA code BIR. For arrival a belt is there to collect luggage that is manually handled. Aircrafts that this airport gets is ATR, Beech, Twin otter and the likes. For departure a small hall is there which houses check in counters dedicated to domestic operators, few seating benches, toilets, security check points and one cafe. Not clean, looks dirty. Parking is available outside. Taxis are available for conveyance.",NEUTRAL
Birmingham,airport,S Peale,3/7/2025,"A very smooth experience, for a sunday morning, flight. Security was quick and efficient, taking under 10 minutes to pass through. The departure lounge had a good range of shops and places to eat while waiting for the flight. The gate was just a few minutes walk from the main departure lounge area, and boarding was very efficient. With good local transport links, and parking options, the airport does all one needs from a regional airport, and is a lot easier than travelling to a London airport.",POSITIVE
Birmingham,airport,N Dyer,1/27/2025,"Honest to goodness it's an embarrassment when you come from a developing country in Africa that's got their act together then you come back and you suffer the degrading humiliation of Birmingham. Right from the drop off being over a mile from the check-in. The departure lounge toilets not having seats, or broken and the standard of hygiene, I simply cannot understand how environmental health allow them to operate at all! The duty free was three times the price of buying retail at the destination. My one takeaway of the airport is to never use it again.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham,airport,N Jamous,10/7/2024,"Queues are snaking before the departure gates, past the lifts, all the way downstairs, snaking all the way up to marks and Spencer. 45 mins before you get to security gates and another 45 mins past the gates, security staff just rude and shout at passengers all the time.. needless to say I was not involved in any shouting just observations the way they were talking to passengers who were understandably worried missing their flights. Utterly disgraceful and disgusting place.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham,airport,Peter Dekker,10/4/2024,"This has got to be without doubt the worst airport in the world. Queues everywhere, inside and outside the building. It has looked like an ongoing building site for years. Access poor - hideously expensive quick drop off car park. The 20 min free car park is just far enough away to mean you cannot get to the terminal and back before having to pay. The check in queues seem to be everywhere. The escalators are intermittently out of service. The signage is poor or non existent in places. One of the few airports I have been through recently where you still have to pay for a trolley not that you would be able to push one through the crowds. There is not enough seating in the duty free area. It is hardly every possible to get on a plane without going through a basement holding are to get on an overcrowded bus to be taken practically to the other side of the airport. On arrival you are invariably also put on a bus and taken to a little flight of stairs like a trademan's entrance. This is a shocking way to welcome visitors to the UK.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham,airport,M J Rogers,10/1/2024,"I use this airport regularly due to its location. It constantly disappoints. On this occasion we were held on the plane on our return due to staff shortages, the border control was not a problem which is most unusual. We waited well over an our for our luggage to arrive and when it did it was soaking wet. The worst airport and a poor introduction to this city. Spend some money improving travellers experience rather than retail and catering.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham,airport,Jay Nagley,10/1/2024,"It took 1 hour and 25 minutes from joining the pre-queue for bag drop to getting through security - on a Monday afternoon at the end of September. What is a pre-queue? When they hold you for 10 minutes before getting to the bag drop queue. Then a 10 minute pre-queue for the lift to take you to the queue for security. They took out the staircase last year and made everyone use overloaded lifts. Our lift said Out of Service before it wheezed up to Departures - three minutes to climb one floor. When a Ryanair plane is a haven of peace and civility, you know you have just emerged from a circle of hell. Is Michael O'Leary paying them to ruin the airport, so that his planes seem better? The airport works so hard to ensure it is the worst airport in the UK. Couldn't they spend 10% of the effort on making something (anything) at the airport actually work? I can't review airport shops as my 85 minute queue meant I had to run to the gate. Could I have arrived earlier? Wouldn't have helped, as you can't check in a bag more than 120 minutes before departure.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham,airport,M Smyth,9/30/2024,"Avoid, avoid, avoid at all cost unless you like queueing. It's a shambles of an airport. You queue at every point in the departures. I've never seen anything like it. They took escalators out and put lifts in and that's where the queueing starts.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham,airport,Anja Crounse,7/7/2024,"Avoid this airport at all cost! I have traveled quite a bit in my life, but Birmingham Airport was an experience I never voluntarily hope to relive. I now better understand why my 80 year old mom preferred NOT seeing her son than having to go through this ordeal. This was twenty years ago. Nothing much has changed. Chaotic, going from one long snake line into the next, being ""herded"" into an elevator only to be driven into the next line. I truly felt like cattle. I wonder how those taxfree shops make any money, because you sure have no time or energy left to shop (or get a bite to eat). And when you finally arrive at the gate and actually glad that the plane was delayed (otherwise it would have been a close call), you have to sit on the floor to rest your feet from being on your feet for hours on end. My advise: pick another airport and take the train to Birmingham OR go via Dover and drive up to Birmingham. Driving on the left of the road is less stressful.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham,airport,Neil Hawksworth,6/1/2024,"Totally chaotic at security and passport control, over 2 hrs to get through, massive queues then everyone is shuttled into lifts to go upstairs. Staff no help at all, people were missing flights.",NEGATIVE

A final comment I will never use Birmingham again and yet only 20 minutes from home and have used this airports many many times and many times had problems but no more East Midlands much better.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Jamarkus Burch,6/9/2024,"Staff should be retrained on customer service! Especially American. They are very rude and disrespectful. Flight crew got off the plane and went to another gate 20 min after we were “suppose” to board. When we asked what’s going on we received nothing but attitude from the gate agent. Another gate agent walked up and totally ignored our concerns. We’re at B1 for flight 5253 to CLT. Shortly after the gate agent says there is a maintenance issue and they won’t be in for another 2 hours. We all had the same question: Why wasn’t the plane inspected the night before, being it’s an early morning flight. Secondly, why isn’t maintenance on-site during hours of operation? This is very unprofessional! If there were other options outside of this place that were closer I’d explore it because no one deserves to be treated this way especially early in the morning. I’d rather drive 3 hours to Atlanta than to deal with these Attitudes after we pay our money for a service! My recommendation Don’t fly out of BHM especially with American !",NEGATIVE
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,A Anderson,5/21/2024,Spent the last two days and one night inside the airport. My husband went to several different bathrooms and he said they all smell like urine. Terrible like the guy mopping is just smearing all around. The women’s bathroom had dirty floors and pieces of trash lying around. Several of the toilets weren’t flushed. Food options are very limited. Bham is a foodie city and we should show that off to the world. Maybe allow local favorites to set up pop ups during the tourist seasons!! I could give you tons of recommendations as to who to invite and share their menus with travelers. Give them a true taste of Birmingham.,NEGATIVE
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Colleen Rotkis,3/6/2022,"Security lines are insane. This is my 3rd experience with it, and I’m starting to piece together the scam. Don’t we pay a surcharge on every ticket purchased for the delightful experience of trusting TSA to keep us safe by making us remove our shoes and other useless acts. They keep the security lines long creating stress and panic so you consider signing up for Clear ($179/year and more privacy invasion with a retina scan and fingerprint capture). So the elite (those willing to fork over the dollars on top of their federal and any other taxes that fund airports and plane ticket fees) cruise on through security while the other ~97% of passengers languish in line and miss their flights. How on earth the warlord of the Birmingham airport allows 70% of TSA staff to service the elites on the TSA Precheck/Clear side vs the 30% (~4 TSA employees) on the side of the regular people, only makes sense in a corrupt government deal. I thought that this would be aggravating for the airlines on the other side of the curtain wondering where the passengers were who paid a pretty penny to fly like cattle while being prodded to pull their masks over their nose the whole time. But a little research revealed that the airlines invest in companies like Clear. Silly me. It’s a circular racquet probably formulated along the lines of the Chicago red light camera and parking meter debacle. Bottom line: pay your toll at the troll bridge or suffer along with the peasants.",NEGATIVE
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Don Orlando,2/10/2017,"Birmingham-Shuttlesworth Airport is absolutely exceptional across the board. Modern, well laid out, and astonishingly clean.

Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Iain Bagwell,8/29/2015,"Overall I like BHM. It's small, staff (at least at Delta check in and gate) are super friendly. The amenities are good for a small regional airport. Bags are usually quick to retrieve. My one gripe is parking. The parking deck is always almost very nearly completely full, so finding a space can often take as long as the short flight to connect in ATL. The one other thing that annoys me every time I do find a space is total lack of smart carts in the parking lots. Hey listen up Airport managers. This is an airport and customers travel with baggage. Don't you think it would be a great idea to facilitate this process of getting bags to terminals by offering a cart service in the parking lots?",NEUTRAL
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,T Dokland,9/13/2013,Recent Improvements have made this small airport quite reasonable. There are a few dining and shopping options and the area is fairly large and pleasant. They still play terrible elevator music. Free internet is a bonus. The airport is conveniently located to the city but there is no public transportation available. Parking is $12/day bit it is often difficult to find a spot.,NEUTRAL
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,L Brown,6/26/2013,The airport has been and still under going renovations. The issues with no food past security have been fixed. The wait times are typically very short. Security can become long on Monday mornings but typically it is very quick as well. Walking distances to and from gates as well as to and from parking/car rental are rather short. There are no 1-2 miles walks to gates or otherwise. The biggest issue with the airport is the quality of staff at food outlets but that is not much different at a lot of airports. Overall it is a very good midsize airport.,POSITIVE
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,J Eduardo,11/5/2010,Poor airport overall. Limited food choices once past security. You are stuck with pizza or sandwiches no real sit down restaurants. Many of the food places close very early and start cleaning up the foods even earlier so you are out of luck if you get there too late. Only shops are Hudsons. I have been in smaller airports with much better facilities. Not very clean bathrooms were untidy and common area were just plain dirty benches with food spilled on them that sat for the entire 3 hours I waited for my flight. Not an airport I would ever want to be stuck in for an extended period.,NEGATIVE
Birsa Munda,airport,Shresth Krishna,4/25/2019,Worst airport full with unnecessary redtapism. Management is even worse. Timing and gates were changed without notifying at the last moment. No one is available for enquiriy. Flight attendant of one particular flight will not cooperate for flights of other companies.,NEGATIVE
Birsa Munda,airport,Vishal Pandey,3/9/2016,"The new Terminal at Birsa Munda Airport - Ranchi is a welcome surprise for many. Its a small but modern terminal with a few amenities that are actually not needed as the wait times are low due to low traffic. You will find seats on both floors and few coffee shops to make your wait easier. The airside is separated by tall glass panels and one can be entertained by watching the arriving / departing planes. Disembarkment and Boarding is done via the 2 modern aerobridges that are truly of international standards. Since it is a small airport, the security checks and check-in process is very informal and the staff are courteous and helpful. I always have pleasant experience in this small modern airport. I wish there were more flights.",POSITIVE
Bishkek,airport,Adrian Pritchard,2/26/2023,"Tiny airport in the middle of nowhere. Rude security and immigration staff. Lots of completely unnecessary passport checking long before security.

Overall, an amateur airport. Wifi wouldn't connect.",NEGATIVE
Bishkek,airport,Kieran Shotter,6/29/2019,"Small airport which seemed a bit chaotic. Flew with Turkish airlines their first flight was delayed so check in for mine was busy due to 5 counters checking in two full flights. Immigration was quick didn't ask to many questions. Security metal detector doesn't work they just pat down everybody coming through. After security, not much food places on one end can get busy in the departure area. Boarding was a mess no queuing system for two flights with desks close together so people kept getting into the wrong queue. Fine airport for a short time.",NEUTRAL
Bishkek,airport,Alex Johnson,11/26/2017,"A small and basic airport, which is rather difficult for transit passengers due to the long wait times at security. I flew through Bishkek on a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Ulaanbaatar which has an hour stop in Bishkek before you rejoin the same plane. The problem with Bishkek is it takes a good 30 minutes to get though the security check as there is only one scanner. Once through though, there is a smoking area, several shops and a small bar, but you won't get much time to avail of these facilities! The departure screens don't seem to work, and when it is time to board, an airport staff member simply shouts the destination of the flight.",NEGATIVE
Bishkek,airport,David G Stein,7/17/2014,Simple clean and functional airport. Check in and security ws doe with ease. The food vendors are on the expensive side and do not accept credit cards.

Bishkek,airport,S Odoca,7/12/2014,It is a small airport with standard facilities. Need more Jetways as most of the time the aircraft is forced to park far away from airport building. However the officers' attitudes in the CIQ area are amazingly modest compared to the ones from the other neighbouring Central Asian airports such as Almaty and Astana.,NEUTRAL
Bishkek,airport,John Middleton,11/7/2012,Small functional airport. No frills. Arrived at about 3.30am from London. Not many passengers on the flight. Everything went smoothly and we were through immigration baggage and customs in no time. Once landside I realised my cell phone had fallen out of my pocket probably on the plane. A member of the BMI ground staff called the plane who found the phone and brought it to me. If arriving at Bishkek always make sure you are being collected at the airport by someone you trust and don't rely on taxis at the airport. Check in on the return trip at about 5.30 am was trouble free if a little slow on account of no online check in for my Turkish Airlines flight and painfully sluggish check in and security check staff. Travelled Business Class. Don't expect much from the BC lounge. Tired sandwiches and cake very limited choice of beverages and staff who were more interested in keeping up their conversation with each other to be bothered with the customers. Overall the airport did its job. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.,NEUTRAL
Bishkek,airport,J Joshua,5/1/2009,"Overall the airport does the job and is an adequate small international hub but travellers beware of a dangerous scam by unregistered taxi drivers here. My driver was touting for custom with the rest of them as I came out of customs and immigration but turned out to be working with a fellow ""passenger"" who stopped the car between the airport and the city and extorted money from me to complete the journey. Two young men to one older man no contest here. Foolishly I only spotted the warning signs that the two of them were trouble too late and am grateful that it was only my pocket that was dented. Only ever take a registered taxi with the yellow taxi sign on top or better still have someone meet you. It sounds obvious but as most flights arrive here in the middle of the night it is possible to be caught out as I was.",NEUTRAL

After passport control all they have is a small cafe and a little souvenir shop. X-ray and metal detector was not working so they just did a basic manual search for everything. There is a small lounge upstairs before passport control but not working and terminal is full of insects. It’s like a 1980’s bus station and they only have 1 or 2 flights a day. Guinea-Bissau is very poor and this airport reflects that.",NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,J Parkinson,10/22/2014,Myself and husband have used Blackpool airport 6 times in the last 12 months - yes you pay £10 each departure tax but you can see nothing has been spent on the upkeep. I will still say we prefer going from Blackpool - there is less trouble and a lot less fuss. From landing and picking up our cases we can be home in an hour - we are very sad at its closing. We have just arrived home last night - we went from Blackpool put had to come back in to Manchester which we think is a nightmare - very sad customers.,NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,Paul Cox,10/13/2014,Flew to Dublin yesterday (8th October) after catching train from Preston where I had been working for a few days to Squires Gate which is about a 10 minute walk. £10 ADF was a bit of a disappointment but check-in and security a breeze. Staff friendly and efficient. Depatures lounge was a bit old-fashioned (not necessarily a bad thing quite nostalgic really) but was very clean and the cafe was good. Aer Lingus as always a joy to travel with.,POSITIVE
Blackpool,airport,Helen Heron,9/17/2014,We have just returned from a trip to Tenerife with Jet2 and used Blackpool for the first time as the flight times from here were excellent. Yes it is only small but check in a security were swift with no problems encountered and adequate facilities for a drink and a little browse in the duty free. On our return again swift baggage claim and on the road home within half an hour. The only downside we arrived well before we were meant to and check in wasn't even open however the parking was a nightmare. We went right round the back to the overflow car park and only at the very last minute managed to squeeze on the end of someone else. I cant imagine what would have happened if wed left it later we would have missed our flight. Also it was a long walk to the terminal building and it was pouring with rain we were amazed their wasn't and easier way in to the building also our car on return was covered in dust from all the passing vehicles. This aside I would travel from here again as the good out weighs the bad but I really think you should assess the parking situation as this is very limited for the passengers travelling and is letting this airport down?,POSITIVE

After travelling to and from Venice in June I had Venice down as the worst airport in Europe but my experience in Blackpool proved it to be even worse than Venice! First of all parking is a nightmare parking in an unsecure field 15 mins walk from the terminal. You then enter the grubby check in hall (Jet2 check in quite efficient) pay the extortionate departure tax and spend the next hour in a breeze block corridor waiting for the rude and inefficient security staff. Finally you are allowed into what they laughingly name the departure hall to find that all the seats are taken. How long will Jet2 stay at this airport?,NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,K Mond,4/3/2014,"This place is the pits! Ever since they took over which is several years ago the owners impose an Airport Development Tax (ADT) of £10 per person. Yes if you are going to be back in less than 2 weeks it entitles you to ""free"" parking (how can a tax of £10 per head be free) on a quagmire at best with absolutely no security. The tax was allegedly to develop the airport (hence the name) but every cent of it goes into the pockets of the Directors. Not a single penny has been spent on improvements. The owners will argue that the place has been improved .... and it has. However the franchises that use the place (duty free cafe newsagents etc) all paid for the improvements so don't believe the owners. The place is also filthy and cold and when it rains they have to use buckets to collect rainwater. As for the security and check-in staff - the check-in staff turn up when they feel like it and the security staff are rude and surly and totally objectionable. Completely different to the pleasant and helpful staff at Manchester.",NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,G Cameron,10/29/2013,Dreadful do not let your student sons and daughters fly home from Blackpool. My son had to scrape the £10 ADF fee from his pockets. He is a student with virtually no money and had no warning that he was going to need an extra Â£ £10! Very unfair and simply disgusting. I intend to complain to Jet2 about the airport they are using.,NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,C Knight,10/15/2013,I flew from Blackpool airport to Belfast for the first time I always fly from Liverpool to Belfast with Easyjet but the flight times were better and it was slightly cheaper to fly with Jet2 from Blackpool. I was expecting a small airport with limited facilities but nothing prepared me for the facilities here. Parking is free which was a bonus for me when booking on arrival however both car parks P1 and P2 were full and ended up abandoning my car on a grass area known as an overfill car park. This was a 10 minute walk to the airport. On arrival there was nothing before the departure lounge. The cash machine was out of service and WHSmiths closed. Paying the £10 airport charge was no problem and I was assisted with my baggage tag by a very helpful Jet2 worker. The worst experience was going through security where the staff were extremely rude not just with me but with an elderly couple in front of me. I agree that security needs to be strict but not intrusive and this was made a much more uncomfortable experience by the rudeness and lack of customer service with the staff. I will never be using this airport again and even after a drink from the limited choice in the cafe/bar I was still reeling. I can safely say this is the 1st and last time I will use this airport.,NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,Paul Wharmby,9/8/2013,We travelled to Turkey on Jet2 mid-August returning early-September. We travelled from Blackpool as the holiday was some £250 cheaper than using Manchester. The car park ticket machine had run out of tickets but that didn't matter as the barriers to P2 had been broken off. We parked a good 5 minutes' walk from the terminal but it's free so I don't really see that being a problem. The terminal building is very basic and is more reminiscent of a coach station but check-in and security were both quick and easy (as was paying the ADF) and we were sitting in the bar area enjoying our first drink of the holiday while we'd still have been in the security queue at Manchester. An important point was that because we were going on a small plane to a small airport check-in at Dalaman on our return was incredibly easy drawing jealous stares from fellow travellers who were in 200-long queues. On our return to Blackpool from wheels stop through security and baggage reclaim to leaving the airport took less than 30 minutes. You absolutely cannot get better. The airport has a runway planes somewhere to sit and somewhere to get a drink. What else do you need?,POSITIVE
Blackpool,airport,Alan Shaw,8/4/2013,Whilst the amenities are those of a small airport they are still extremely limited. My main concerns regarding this airport are the poor services offered by the lounge and payment charged is way in excess of services on offer. There are limited drinks no WIFI limited snacks and maximum stay without flight delays is approximately one hour. Also when flight arrivals are able to collect their luggage and able to visit the conveniences there is only one female toilet one male toilet and one disabled toilet all with insufficient toilet rolls. Totally unsatisfactory when approximately 300 people are landing.,NEGATIVE
Blackpool,airport,Peter Walker,7/3/2013,The poor lighting inside makes it look as if you have just walked into a fairground dark ride. The gents toilet (singular you'll notice) always smells of something unpleasant. The advertising blurb tells of facilities that are never open and it has a help desk that is manned only when the staff feel like it which is as good as never. It looks like an uncompleted job on which the builders have walked off because the service pipes are all exposed and there is not so much as a false ceiling to hide it all. It has been like this for decades. To then ask the public to pay £10 each to refurbish something that should be done out of the operating profits over many years is a disgrace. Forget expecting to see a terminal akin to those airy ones with glass and steel as at `proper` airports this is a chicken-shed inspired windowless dark oblong box. You are unable to see any aircraft from inside or outside so plane spotters stay away.,NEGATIVE
Blantyre,airport,Wilbert Wolfs,2/2/2009,Arriving at Blantyre's Chileka airport is a colonial experience. Arriving from Johannesburg the airplane is taxied in front of the arrival hall. School classes have already been run out to see the big bird landing. The building has a wooden veranda and there is a special area were people are expected to cheer after the president has landed. The first time I arrived at Chileka the luggage was simply dropped on the tarmac. The passengers had to fight to get their possessions. Of course quite some passengers did not find any luggage at all as it had stayed behind in Jo'burg. Immigration is quite impressive with a lot of stamps in passports and on listings. To get out you have to go through a door then you turn sharply turn left and right. Again left until you bump into the departing passengers and their luggage. Since half a year we have a new arrival hall at our airport.,NEUTRAL
Blantyre,airport,Duncan Lee,7/14/2004,I flew from Blantyre airport a number of years ago and was struck by just how quaint the whole set up was. It is a very basic airport not far off the common 'tin shack' analogy that comes with most African airports. There is very little to do and there is just a bar to distract you. The best thing about Blantyre airport is the Duty Free shop. A selection so limited it is almost refreshing: Malawi Gin Whisky (JW) Cane spirit macadamia nuts coffee and nick nacks. I bought to 60W light bulbs that had been turned into paraffin lamps. Wonderful.,NEUTRAL
Bloemfontein,airport,Abraham Faure,1/11/2011,The improvements I mentioned in 2007 were completed on schedule and have given this airport a new and modern feel. Unfortunately the upper level is no longer a viewing deck area. However a new restaurant with a view of the airfield was installed on the ground floor. Facilities are top class considering the size of the airport. A brand new baggage retrieval area was added to the airport. The layout of the airport works well. Staff are still just as friendly.,POSITIVE
Bloemfontein,airport,Abraham Faure,9/19/2007,Bloemfontein airport is currently undergoing improvements to its buildings and facilities. This is with a view to the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup to be held in South Africa. I love this little airport because there is an air of excitement and a bustle of activity. While the upstairs cafeteria is undergoing improvements there is a downstairs cafeteria where refreshments may be purchased. The airport personnel are some of the friendliest i have ever met! Their are ample parking and car rental facilities available.,POSITIVE
Bloemfontein,airport,Gareth Bronkhorst,9/12/2005,A very small airport with a few facilities including a shop and a upstairs restaurant. They have several car hire firms to choose from if you are intending to rent a car. What was quite strange was that the arrivals and departure hall is in the same part of the airport. Check in was very speedy and over in less than a minute. The good thing is that you will not be subject to very long queues and passing through security is quite fast. If you happen to be at the airport alone take some reading material as there is not much activity and you might get bored fast.,POSITIVE
Bloomington,airport,S Hedden,12/1/2010,Very pleasant and easy airport. Rental car lot a few steps from the exit door. Spacious airport has 9 gates but only about half are in use. Only complaint is restaurant is before security and closes their grill well before the last flights depart in the evening.,POSITIVE
Boa Vista,airport,1 reviewsDaryn Johnson,6/18/2015,"I personally really like this airport. It's small but does everything it needs to. It looks more like a sand castle than an airport but every time I've used it it's been easy to check in. Unfortunately there is no smoking area anywhere in the airport and considering a fair portion is non smoking I find that a bit strange. Also, once I was delayed and as there are no tannoy announcements you are left wondering about that status of your flight which if you've travelled TACV can be understood. However, if you're a resident of Cape Verde you do get used to the ""no stress"" mentality even if it can be frustrating sometimes. There's a bar either side of check in/customs and they serve snacks. There's also a small duty free shop but most airline's stock would be more comprehensive.",POSITIVE
Bocas Del Toro,airport,Andre Franca,12/25/2012,BDT-PAC. The airport is located on the Colon island you can actually walk into town but still taxis will charge you only 2 usd that's nothing really! There's only one building very small one x-ray and two counters one for each airline there are no carousels you'll have to wait them to offload your bags so you can pick them up on arrivals hall on departure the airline staff will open your bags to search for dangerous goods etc. The airport was under refurbishment but I believe it will soon need a better upgrade!,NEUTRAL
Bodrum,airport,M Martin,10/16/2024,"What a horrible little airport. Queue for xray, queue for check in, queue passport control, queue for security again! Food prices are ridiculous, absolute rip off. What a horrible place, I won't be coming back to Bodrum ever again.",NEGATIVE
Bodrum,airport,Sharon Heffernan,10/7/2024,"We departed from Bodrum Airport & decided to try & get some food. There’s hardly any eating outlets & what there is are extortionate, we looked at 3 chicken burgers but at £63 we decided against it, bottled water was also expensive. Surely lowering prices would encourage people to buy.",NEGATIVE
Bodrum,airport,4 reviewsJamie Green,7/27/2024,"What a lovely little airport, the whole experience seemed organised with little to no queuing areas as passengers seemed to just self manage to the different areas of the airport. From check in to departure the airport was very clean with little wrong on this front. I found myself very impressed with the smiling security team as I went through pre security and main search area as well. Arrivals was good as well with clean arrivals area straight from the plane. I was really impressed with this airport when comparing to some of the UK airports, it has a much higher standard. Wifi runs on a free voucher system which worked a treat, very easy with no need to sign up. Shopping is not great as there is just a duty free shop and F&B is limited and expensive. Overall a very good airport.",POSITIVE
Bodrum,airport,Vicky Nimmo,7/6/2024,"Worst airport I have been to, I won't actually be returning to Bodrum as the airport is so poor, price ridiculous, very warm, machine for water only takes card, have to queue to scan passport to get code for Internet which was needed as we were delayed and had to contact family, the code lasts 1 hour then need to queue again, the machine is very temperamental, staff miserable not friendly or helpful, will not be returning to Bodrum airport again.",NEGATIVE
Bodrum,airport,Deb Haines,7/3/2024,What a shame this place leaves you with such a negative feeling of Turkey. No place for filling up water; ridiculous prices by any airport standards for any liquid or food; staff generally acting as if they don't want to be there and finally a random intrusive search of body and hand luggage in the waiting lounge by people who should be working for correctional services. Also free wifi requires espionage search to find the kiosk you need to get a required pin to connect.,NEGATIVE
Bodrum,airport,M Pataillot,5/23/2024,"Worst experience ever. I felt totally unsafe in a sort of hostile territory.  Firstly, resent having to scan my passport in a random machine to access WIFI. The vending machines are in Turkish only. Something went wrong after scanning my card, I asked several officials. All i needed was help with translation, not my job, ring number, etc. It seems they were sort of enjoying it as the people I had asked were all around me on their phones (though at work) while i was obviously distressed. Uncomfortable too.",NEGATIVE
Bodrum,airport,Kevin Berghuis,10/26/2023,"Very unfriendly staff, almost aggressive. Very slow check in. 20 euro for cheeseburger and 5 euro for a coca cola, 6 euro for a coffee. Never experienced this before and we travel a lot. I will never go there again. Better go with Izmir airport.",NEGATIVE
Bodrum,airport,J Dunne,9/15/2020,"This place is an absolute joke. The new amenities are useless, there are lots of staff doing nothing and the Covid-19 checks and extra security checks means everything takes 3 times as long with long queues. The only water you can get is from a vending machine or the only food booth charging extortionate prices. This place is the worst I've ever experienced including Moscow! The new management should be held accountable and sacked.",NEGATIVE
Bodrum,airport,M Sheppard,10/1/2019,"Perfectly adequate facilities spoilt by sullen, even aggressive staff. The place is expensive and food availability and options poor as you would expect. In contrast Izmir airport two hours to the North is altogether different so if travelling to a destination anywhere north of Bodrum give that consideration. They also have more extensive flight options.",NEGATIVE
Bodrum,airport,Clive Heys,7/27/2019,"Problems with arrival and departure. Arrival: Arrived an hour late at 23.00. Three flights worth of passengers, about 500 people, arrived in passport control together. Six passport gates. All staffed but none working. Lights above each gate indicating which type of arrivals for which gate. Lights kept changing. Staff kept arriving and leaving each gate. No info displayed or given. After around 60 minutes, they started processing us. Total time from arrival to transfer coach, around 2 hours. Pretty inexcusable I’m afraid, given that they knew the flights were arriving, and when. Departure: no signage as to which queue to join, reliant on wandering Jet2 staff for info. Airport staff at initial security check very surly. Food and duty free area too busy, food and drinks expensive, duty free prices a lot higher than UK high street on average. Woefully inadequate seating. No helpful info. A further security check was suddenly invoked but only for gates 201 and 202. This was so slow that it would have jeopardised our departure, had we not already been delayed. No info at all about delay. Around 90 mins at gate with 8 staff and no info. No toilets for this time without going beck through security checkpoint. The security check at the departure gate was the FIFTH and last. Question, if you need to do a fifth security check, are you not admitting that at least one (I’m being polite here) of your previous checks was a little bit of a waste of time? Only actually arrived at Manchester about 40 mins late, but that’s not an achievement, it’s an indication of the fraudulent amount of slack built into the flight times, a practice which is only “bettered” by the UK rail industry.",NEGATIVE
Bogota,airport,Sam Mendez,6/10/2024,"Everything was delayed, staff were all over the place and not communicating with one another. I’m 5’8 and had to be pushed in a wheelchair, I’m not a small person I know that but for the staff to sit there and say I’m fat was very inappropriate, I was tempted to ask for her name and manager but like I said I had a broken ankle and I didn’t have any fight in me to go back and fourth. I just needed to get out of there.  My friend had to push me around even though we had handicap service, and she had to follow behind a worker who disappeared eventually. Like I said before, very unprofessional. Another experience we had was at the ice cream shop. The lady was refusing to serve my friend another flavor because we “couldn’t do that” we need to pay more, granted money is not an issue but she refused to serve her even after my friend told her to charge her. I don’t know if everyone was having a bad day or what but everything was made difficult. Staff needs to be trained better and have hospitality.",NEGATIVE
Bogota,airport,S Hariante,3/3/2024,Modern airport and hub for flights in South America. But we can’t find staff that speak English (apart from the immigration officers) and they are rude as well. We were here several times connecting between various flights in South America.,NEGATIVE
Bogota,airport,Harold Bush,1/31/2024,"A very modern, elegant and efficient airport. From taxi to lounge it took us less than 15 minutes. But beware of extreme and violent security just before boarding. We were forced to leave our bags in the middle of the passage way leading to the airbridge and moved against the wall, while a sniffer dog went over them. No one told us what to do or what to expect. Then we were forded to face the wall while a police office hand searched us. No instructions was given, not even in Spanish; we just follow what others did. Very scary. I have never seen anything like this before. My hand was violent moved upwards by the police officers during the search. Iberia should have informed us this was going to happen, and what to do. A lot of passengers complained and the pilot called the dispatcher on board (the purser told us). Not a nice experience being treated like criminals as though one was in a prison and they were carrying out security checks. A nasty experience which damages the reputation of a rather very pleasant airport.",NEGATIVE
Bogota,airport,S Caresco,3/11/2023,"Most of the staff doesn’t speak English and doesn’t understand e-tickets. At first they insisted to send us to the check ins and make 2 hours of queue despite us already having the tickets and only hand luggage. Afterwards, during the boarding, they kept bouncing us from a gate to another because they didn’ bother checking properly the tickets. In both cases we had to search for the only member of the staff who could understand how an airport works and explain it to their colleagues. They should be more professional, organised, and should learn english, given it’s an international airport!",NEGATIVE
Bogota,airport,F Gorte,2/25/2023,"Worst airport in South America.

Bogota,airport,T Carter,1/24/2023,"All staff pretty rude and didn’t speak any English. Nobody seemed to want to help in any way. That’s fine, but I get to security and basically all I have is my wallet and a water bottle. They snatch my water bottle and throw it away. Very wasteful and rude. Would have chugged it right there no problem. Extremely annoying and frustrating way to end my time here in Colombia.",NEGATIVE
Bogota,airport,A Fuentes,8/19/2022,"Transit to other destinations in Colombia requires passing through immigration, for which the waiting time is usually over an hour long - a two hour stopover is often too short to make the connection! Airport signs are also poor, so first-timers end up confused as to where to go and swathes of the airport do not have staff present to give directions or information.",NEGATIVE
Bogota,airport,N Shearer,10/27/2021,"Bogota airport continues as one of the worst transit experiences: continuing the war on water 10 years on. Bottles of liquid are instantly and shamelessly dispatched for, I presume, later use, while a bottle of water costs USD 5 or 6 airside. Always remember not to bring duty free, or even a simple bottle of water in your hand baggage. The previous immigration check is slow, the entire area in front of the booths is occupied by people queueing. Allow 20-30 minutes to traverse this mess. The WiFi continues to be almost unusable, slow, and dropping connections. A local SIM card, or roaming, are still essential to be able to communicate. The food court, at the very very far end of terminal 1 after multiple non-functioning walkways, has limited opening hours, until 9pm, unremarked on any display or even in front of the court or restaurants. A miserable selection of fast food was all that was available. Flight announcements are haphazard, colliding, varying in volume so it's almost guaranteed that the announcements for the flight you're sitting closest to will inevitably be drowned out by someone screeching into the microphone at the far end of the terminal. All in all, a very poor experience.",NEGATIVE
Bogota,airport,Märt Aab,1/22/2020,"It is another normal airport. Period. I arrived Monday around 7:15 PM. Immigration queue was around 15 minutes. EU passport, question about if for tourism, answer ""business meeting"", stamp, all done. Customs - do you have anything to declare, ""no"", this lane please, 20 minutes after landing out. Upstairs to buy local SIM card for data (70K COP for 1 week / 2GB), nice ladies helping to activate it (you need the help), back down to get the taxi (go to queue for yellow ones, 40K to the city, up it to 50K to be polite). Return Friday flight 9:15PM, arriving to airport 7PM, left city 6PM - this time of the day it takes 1hr from city to airport. Passport control + security = 15 minutes again. Security took away my beard scissors (3cm), that have been OK around the world (only Dubai has done the same once from 3 times). All cool. Did not even try the airport WIFI - found that this sucks everywhere. Enough shopping after security. I did get my souvenir coffee and other stuff. Eating after getting in to airport security area is an only real problem ... there is a food court where everyone queues for Burger King and next to that there are some .. not-so-pizza-pizza place and some other strange places where no one buys anything. Based on my experience for an EU citizen it is very OK airport, only thing to complain about is the eating possibilities.",NEGATIVE

Boise,airport,C Anderson,2/7/2022,Forgot my mask and expected to be greeted with a negative/cold attitude but it was quite the opposite.

Boise,airport,K Miller,8/13/2020,"A young woman was ahead of me at the TSA line and an older grumpy TSA agent told her to put a jacket on because her tank top was ""pretty revealing."" There was nothing special or revealing about this tank top, just your normal tank top that shows your shoulders as a tank top does. The airport is not a private school or a church. This man had no right to tell this poor girl to put a jacket on. Who does he think he is? The pastor of a church? She probably felt so embarrassed and ashamed and had absolutely nothing to feel that way about. He said it loudly enough that all of the people visibly turned around in line to look at her. The TSA in this airport need sensitivity training. This agent should be reprimanded. He is not this woman's father or authority figure in any way besides to check that she and everyone around her is making safe decisions to fly, he is not the dress code police. Despicable. It's 2020, women can wear a tank top if they choose to and absolutely nobody at the airport should feel that they have the authority to tell someone to cover up.",NEGATIVE
Boise,airport,Diana Neill,1/4/2020,"Upon arrival at the airport, there was a huge line but only a few staff. I went through Alaska Airlines. It was very confusing where I was supposed to go because there were so many people and so many different lines. The lines didn't look like lines at all. I checked in at the kiosk, got my boarding pass, then a lady who was walking around helping people said I needed to get a bag tag printed. So I had to go back in line and wait to get the tag printed. I had to pay a $30 fee, even though I have elite status and have never had to pay a bag fee before. I had never gone through the kiosk before. Then when I got to the front, she said I needed to wait to answer some questions. After standing there several minutes and seeing many people get helped who were there after me, I was finally helped. They just needed emergency contact name and number. Then going to the line for the security check, there were about 300 people there. I got to the airport an hour before my flight and when I got to the gate, they were already boarding. Seriously, they need more organization and more staff to help customers.",NEGATIVE
Boise,airport,1 reviewsKyle Kaupins,8/1/2016,"Boise is a smaller sized airport which takes in most if the state's airline traffic. Walking into the airport from the parking garage in the winter time can be quite grueling and in summer afternoons the outside can be very hot. Check in lines are never too long and the check in area is large with very pretty murals on the walls to look at. Lighting in any part of the terminal is not a problem with great natural light. Pre TSA there is only one eating area that is nothing special and the baggage claim is older giving you a 90's esque feel. For the size if the airport, the baggage handlers do take their sweet time getting the bags to their destination. I have waited over half an hour for bags before. Moving on to TSA, the lines are usually quick and screening does not take long. There is only one full body detector but traffic still flows freely. Due to the recent TSA problems though, the lines have reached back towards check in, but lines are never hectic in the morning. Post TSA is a set of large windows and an eating area. The windows give a great view across the airport. Food in the airport is classy, but a little sub par. The McDonalds that used to be the main attraction is now replaced with more Boise-like restaurants. Five guys and Einsteins bagels take up most of the hunger goers. On the other side of the eating are is a local brewing company. Shopping in the upper terminal is nothing to write home about - there is an MSNBC and cute convenience stores. The airport has no specialty shops and the stores all sell the exact same things, like candy, magazines, and little Idaho potato dolls. The C terminal below is dark, and again, very 90s esque. Birds have been seen inside the upper terminal before, they are adorable and not a nuisance to passengers. They give a somewhat natural ambiance. One of the biggest problems with the airport is their horrendous seats and very few charging ports. Most of the ports are up against walls or beams. Restrooms are located in one spot in the B terminal, and one location, just past TSA. Overall, the airport seems very clean friendly, like most of Idaho. A pretty good airport. Not great, but pretty good.",POSITIVE
Boise,airport,M McManus,10/10/2012,The airport is a small regional airport. However there is a nice souvenir shop and a decent number of places to eat given its modest size. One thing you will see in the airport is life size cardboard cut outs of the famous Boise State American Football team the town's most famous export. There is a bus link from the airport to downtown but when I went it appeared to be having serious delays. A cab into downtown is not too expensive. The queuing times are very quick as this airport never really gets too busy as it is small.,POSITIVE
Boise,airport,R Dunford,5/31/2009,Pleasant enough airport small yet not crowded enough for it to be oppressive. Free internet for your laptop throughout the terminal is good (take note Seattle Dulles and O'Hare). Easy enough to find your car hire too and the petrol station outside the airport isn't too much of a rip off. Only real complaint is the signs to/from the airport could be better.,POSITIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,Begum Yakut,2/17/2025,"In a comment, it was said that the airport is great for arrivals but terrible for departures. This is absolutely true! It was the worst service I’ve had and the worst airport I’ve ever used for a return flight from abroad! On February 15, 2025, we were passengers with my husband on flight PGT49BB from Bologna to Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen Airport. It took so long for us to check-in our baggage. When we saw the queue to pass through to the airside before passport control, we couldn’t even do a tax refund. As we were hoping for this disgrace to end so we could return to our country, boarding started from gate 19, and we were lucky enough to sit and wait until the line thinned out. When the queue decreased, we joined it. Two female ticket agents were handling the boarding. Despite having no cabin baggage with us (we had checked it in), the ticket agent told me that my two pockets, one about 30x40 cm and the other about 16x18 cm, contained too many items and that I wouldn’t be allowed on the plane with them. At that moment, my husband was also waiting for the other ticket agent to do the boarding. Since I had never heard such nonsense before, I told her that if I had too many pockets, I could transfer some items from one to the other and discard one pocket. Clearly, this didn’t sit well with her, as she was going to ask for money. Suddenly, she told me she wouldn’t let me on the plane and instructed me to go to the back of the line. I raised my voice and warned her that she had no right or authority to do that, and that she was obligated to let me on the plane. In response, the other female ticket agent rudely turned her back and made threats like, “We’ll call the police, and we won’t let you on the plane.” An airport that shows such disrespect to tourists should be ashamed. In the end, they should be thankful that I didn’t call the police because I didn’t want to take the passengers’ time. They ruined the end of our wonderful vacation because of their attitude, which we had never encountered in any airport before.",NEGATIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,Michel Gagner,12/7/2024,"Not enough seating after security. No fast track before 5 am for business passengers. No lounge after security.

Bologna Marconi,airport,K Carsen,8/21/2024,"This is the worst airport we have ever flown from. Our cruise ended in Ravenna and we had the choice of flying home from either Bologna or Venice. We chose Bologna because it was nearer. Big mistake!! Through no fault of our own, we arrived at the airport at 10am for a 5pm flight to London. We couldn't check in until 2pm, so we had to hang around, with our luggage for 4 hours. The check-in area was heaving and there was limited seating. The seats were metal and very uncomfortable! There were shops and food outlets so we could eat and drink. 2pm came and we were able to check-in. A large queue quickly formed behind us but the lady in charge refused to open the check-in until she had had the floor cleaned to remove a few scuff marks! We checked-in, eventually cleared the long security queue and found ourselves in Departures. If we thought the check-in floor was bad, Departures was an absolute nightmare! For an international airport, the area was very small and horribly overcrowded. Seating was even more limited than downstairs and people were sitting on the floor. We saw one woman sitting in a corner breastfeeding her baby! There were long queues for the toilets. There were a couple of food outlets but no seats, so it was a choice of stand up or sit on the floor! All in all, Bologna airport was a very unpleasant experience and we will never fly from there again.",NEGATIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,N Keale,8/3/2024,"Terrible airport, like something from the dark ages. Old and no signage. Lots of staff in the wrong place, Its not set up for transit. Forget about seating, they have 20 for hundreds of people. The staff though friendly don’t have knowledge of things. You just have to wonder around hoping for the best.",NEGATIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,Jakob Ahfir,6/10/2024,"Worst airport I’ve seen in my life. Poorly built beyond belief with cafeterias having queues out into the extremely narrow passageways. At least 4 times as many passengers as seats forcing most visitors to sit on the floor. If you can avoid coming here, do so!",NEGATIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,1 reviewsJ Mayes,5/21/2024,"This might be the worst airport in Europe. I’ve traveled here twice (2021 and 2024). The gate area is a zoo. People constantly climbing over each other to just find room to stand, let alone sit. The check-in and security are bad, but not as bad as gate area. I literally created this account to vent because I simply do not understand. It is pure misery and adds stress to an otherwise wonderful trip to see family and friends in the region. Airport management and regional authorities should be embarrassed about this. Other Italian cities like Firenze have terrible airports too, but I really cannot compare to Bologna. Emilia–Romagna is one of the few regions with relative wealth in Italy, which makes this more tragic. “Tourists come spend your money on ragù and get back in your cattle vans and go away”. What’s worse is when you make comparisons to mid-size cities in countries like Spain (Málaga, Valencia, etc), which have less money, but still have comfortable, clean and well-organized airports.",NEGATIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,Tarja Karlsson,5/3/2024,"The airport is misery. Bagagge lost and no info of when to receive it. Had to go back to airport the next day and stand in a queue for 2.5 hours in a small corridor without air and with angry and stressed 100 others who lost their luggage several days ago. Only one part of the queue could be helped during too short ""service"" times. The staff was overcrowdwd and work under non-worthy circumstances. At departure no seating and overcrowded because people need to circulate to buy in the shops or restaurants. I will never use this airport again.",NEGATIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,10 reviewsE Darnel,4/5/2024,"What is happening with some Italian Airports? As Florence and Pisa, Bologna is completely and horrendously overcrowded. One cannot walk around at the gate area, which is immediately after a so-called Duty-Free. With people queuing to get on a plane or for a sandwich or coffee, there is no space to get anywhere without pushing your way through. The worse, there is absolutely no air to breath, with all these people standing around. Probably much is because of some low cost airlines, which let you queue well before effectively boarding planes, but whatever it is, Bologna should think about some solution as it is an ordeal. A pity, because personnel is generically very friendly and there are lovely food options in the terminal.",NEGATIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,N Campbell,3/18/2024,"We flew British Airways from LHR to Bologna on 20th February 2024. Despite a half-full plane, BA failed to load my suitcase. We reported this to the Lost Luggage office. The young lady who assisted us was rather casual about the matter, even though we told her I had no clothes but what I was wearing and we were only in Italy for 5 days, and we had a 2.5 hour drive to Jesi. She told us that we could wait to have it delivered to us but it wouldn't arrive until the day we left, or if we guaranteed we would come and pick it up today we could collect it at 18.30 hrs (6.30 pm). We said we would definitely come back at 6.30pm to collect the bag, even though it meant wasting a day waiting around. We confirmed that time three times with her. We duly showed back up at the Airport at 1830 and rang the bell to the Lost Luggage Office. No-one answered. We then noted the sign on the door that said opening hours 20.30-22.00. Another set of people who'd also lost luggage were also trying to make contact with the office. After trying the phone number provided to us by the girl in the morning, and ringing the bell repeatedly, we found an information counter and explained our problem to the woman there. She rang and spoke to someone INSIDE THE LOST LUGGAGE OFFICE, but they refused to speak to us or answer the phone or door. Finally at 20.32pm they answered the bell and let the now THREE groups of people trying to get their luggage in. By then we had accrued a 30 Euro parking fee, and then had to drive to a rural area near Jesi and get into a farmhouse in the dark. Bologna Airport has flights coming in pretty much 24/7 but a lost luggage office that is only open 3.5 hours a day, and refuses to help people outside that time, even if people are present in the office. I am extremely disappointed with the level of service at Bologna Airport, I have informed all my friends (some of whom travel to Italy regularly) to beware of routing their travel through there unless only taking carry-on baggage!",NEGATIVE
Bologna Marconi,airport,Geraldine Farrell,8/17/2023,"Marconi Express monorail service: Surprisingly poor service upon arrival at Bologna Airport from Bologna Centrale. My ticket wouldn't open the gate. I wasn't alone in this as a few others were the same including a man with a baby in a pram. Some got through the gate easily, others with difficulty. My ticket failed to work. There was no visible way to call for help or assistance. We were there and prisoners to the closed gate. The trapped father with pram sent his wife for help; from trying to get out first to help arriving took over 14 minutes. The staff member, when she arrived, was rude and brusque telling that we must have done it wrong. I am not aware of having done anything incorrect but, if I had, there had been no avenue for assistance. Having travelled the world, I can normally cope with a automated ticket! The Marconi Express Experience was very disappointing and actually quite anxiety inducing. At the point that I got through, the poor man with pram was still blocked and it took another 5 minutes for him to get through. I waited with him as he did not speak Italian. The assistant was rude and unpleasant in her responses offering no support or apology. As I waited, I watched another family trying to get through from the other side to go towards Bologna and also struggling. When they eventually got through, they also needed immediate assistance as their child got on the train they, with their luggage, struggled to get on. The doors closed and neither parent was on board. All anxiety inducing stuff! I'll look to get a taxi next time unless the service improves.",NEGATIVE
Bonriki International,airport,Jen Rodger,11/3/2019,"Congratulations everyone on the wonderful new airport at Bonriki! The building is such an improvement on the previous facility and now provides travellers to and from Kiribati with a modern, beautifully designed space to start and finish their Kiribati adventure. I understand their are more features such as a cafe and lounge still in progress but in the meantime could airport management please think of a way to provide water to passengers in the departure lounge as we just experienced nearly 2 hours in hot conditions without water. Many thanks - can't wait to return and see the next stages of the development.",POSITIVE
Bonriki International,airport,18 reviewsGyan Fernando,11/24/2018,"Kiribati is a very small country and as expected the main airport (Bonriki, Tarawa) is very small. It is about the size of a very small warehouse but it was undergoing re-refurbishment. Being a very small airport, the staff were very friendly. After checking in and having passed immigration, you have no option except to go out of the airport and hang about until boarding time which I found rather charming. There are no facilities other than clean toilets but nothing matters in this Paradise of a country!",POSITIVE
Bordeaux,airport,S Miller,2/12/2025,"There are two departure terminals. One called Billi that is for Easy Jet passages. After scanning boarding ticket I went to bag security check that is maybe 5min away. There I needed to scan my boarding pass again when giving my bag. Not really efficient in my opinion. But my problems started when I was waiting for gates to announce. The gates was announced 45min before the flight and to go to the gates I need to pass passport security. And there my fun begin. I was waiting in the line for 20min. And than the security guy who was checking my passport and who barely spoke English told me to move in the side of the line to serve others. He had issue with my passport I have for almost a year and passport I used to arrive in the country. I gave my id to confirm my identity. But instead of letting me through he started to scan each page with UV light and checking each page in the scanning system. He started to scratch my passport with a nail and drop my id to see how its lands. My mother come back checking what take me so long because the airplane company already announced the last call. When like 5min left the manager come, check my passport for 1min and let me pass. I was the last one boarding. I wonder what would happen if they would keep me longer without explanation. Would I need to purchase a new flight ticket because the passport security guy didn't like my passport and id I arrived in the country and been using before to travel to the country.",NEGATIVE
Bordeaux,airport,Frederic Guyot,12/14/2024,"Bordeaux Airport is arguably one of the least impressive airports in Europe. The overall experience can be quite unpleasant, especially for those traveling on business. Customs lines are painfully slow, and the officers can be quite unfriendly. Learning a few basic English phrases would certainly help, particularly since Bordeaux promotes itself as an international destination. Despite its relatively decent size, there are no adequate business lounges, and the ""zone Affaire"" is frequently closed.  There are two internet options available, but neither seems to work reliably. Once you've cleared security, good luck finding amenities; there’s virtually nothing beyond the small boarding gates. Currently, my flight is delayed by two hours, and I can't help but wish I could return to the city instead of wasting my time here. To the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce: please take action to improve this situation!",NEGATIVE
Bordeaux,airport,K Heß,12/5/2024,"The stay at the airport was okay. The baggage claim on arrival worked quickly. The signposting could be better. The arrows were often unclear to me (e.g. pointing downwards when you should go straight up a flight of stairs). Unfortunately, I came across a very unfriendly person at security control who became downright arrogant when I initially didn't understand her in either French or English. It's a shame that people like that work in customer service. Other airports can do better.",NEGATIVE
Bordeaux,airport,Christine Morgan,9/29/2024,"Arrival seemed not too bad. Long walk from the Airplane. Departure was not great. After security there are no seats or space so we opted to pay to go in the Lounge. It was dire!! Filthy carpets and stale sandwiches that had been left out. Minimal food choices however, at least we got a seat. Guess people know how awful the lounge is as for a period of time we were the only two people there. Called to the gate an hour before departure there herded into an area to wait for the flight (which hadn't even arrived) - we did get a seat here. Pretty poor show for Bordeaux.",NEGATIVE
Bordeaux,airport,E Gale,8/28/2024,This airport is beyond belief. No clear signs to security. It is hidden away behind an escalator! Nobody to ask. Wasted 20 minutes to be directed. Passed through security to find a queue a mile long for border control. Another 30 minutes wait and actually missed my flight! Unbelievable. Never seen such a chaotic setup. After missing my flight the queue disappeared. Advise anyone to turn up at least two hours before a flight. Or try another airport!,NEGATIVE
Bordeaux,airport,E Smith,8/21/2024,"This is possibly the worst airport I’ve ever been to, specifically the Billi terminal. The queues are chaotic, passengers have no idea where to go due to lack of signage, the queues go on forever and continue outside where you have to stand in the sun/rain. For some unknown reason we scanned our boarding passes 3 times, once to get through the security gates, once with a lady standing ahead of us 5 seconds later and then once when our bags were checked. A severe lack of organisation and efficiency. The facilities are basic to say the least, the term cattle shed springs to mind. This part of the airport needs some investment to update it.",NEGATIVE
Bordeaux,airport,Peter Smyth,8/2/2024,"The worst airport I have ever experienced.

Bordeaux,airport,S Lima,6/7/2024,"Although Bordeaux enjoys global renown, its airport presents a stark contrast as the worst representation of the city. Despite satisfactory arrival options via public transport and an acceptable check-in area, the horror unfolds post-security. The Ritazza bar fails to satisfy even the most basic needs, and the journey to gate 60 is marred by decrepit surroundings and malfunctioning escalators. The area of gates 57-60 has a couple of vending machines selling drinks, hot beverages and junk food. Chapeau! The absence of any information for improvement exacerbates the disappointment. In rating, zero stars would be a generous gesture.",NEGATIVE

Boston Logan,airport,Buck Blade,12/22/2024,"Traveling through Boston with arrival at Gate A and departure from Gate E. This requires a shuttle bus ride so we make our way to the bus gate and wait, and wait,  because there is only one shuttle bus and it is on its way. Eventually, after about 30 minutes, the bus arrives and we board, all of us, several flights trying to get to Gate E. Standing room only we embark across the ramp, and stop, and reverse because we just pulled in front of a taxing aircraft! Eventually we arrive at Gate E1, our destination, and turn around. Evidently we need to approach from a different direction? So we travel back and around and under and through the terminal to arrive at Gate E13! Which is actually good for us as we're trying to get to E14. The hoard of delayed passengers rush from the bus across the frozen tarmac through the doors up the escalator to the second floor, up the escalator again to the third floor arriving at a locked door? The hoard attempts to reverse, ask attendants for guidance. Help, we are missing our flight!?! ""Eh, don't know"" is the response. Wow, loosing patience. Eventually after beating on the locked door it opens to a surprised Emirates Counter and the hoard rushes by. Amazing incompetence. In the end the flight was delayed for deicing ops, according to the flight crew Logan didn't know it would snow. Our departure gate moved from 14 to 3 and we all laughed ; considering the wizard behind the curtains pulling our levers.",NEGATIVE
Boston Logan,airport,LeRoy McDonald,8/29/2024,"I had the absolutely worst experience at Logan airport today (8-28-2024) First, we were in the security line when the scanners broke down. So, we had to leave the line and get into another line. Fine, this happens, so we move to the back of a different line. Then as we finally got to the point when it was our turn. Then an airport person comes with a wheelchair person and goes before us, no problem. Now it's our turn again, but then another airport person comes with someone else, not handicapped and the two of them just rudely walk right in front of us. No explanation. No ""sorry or ""excuse us"", nothing. Of course, at this point I am now tired of trying to get through this line, so I had said ""Excuse me"". The airport person started flipping her airport badge at me saying she can do anything with this badge. She was scary, and I was really taken aback by her attack. Instead of saying ""Sorry I needed to get this lady through security"", she started yelling that she could call security or the police on me. I was looking to the person that was in the process of taking our ID and she did not understand what was happening either. We were just grateful that this rude, person was walking away now. I probably should have called security on her right away but didn't. This incident really bothered me the rest of the day and I really regret that I did not get her name. This incident happened around 12:30 PM on 8/28/24 in the security line",NEGATIVE

I went to the Delta sky lounge, which was packed and dirty. And the food unappetizing. Mac n cheese, pressed meat. Why can European airports offer baguettes and great salads?

There was a long line - when an employee came over and questioned all of us in line where we were going. She was one of the rudest airline employees I’ve ever encountered. She actually engaged in an argument with someone standing in line. When I told her the kiosks weren’t operating properly and that I’d never done a bag drop off and could she help me, she just walked away. I started asking her another question, and someone just interrupted her - and she attended to him! My granddaughter and I were in line for over an hour - yes, lots of people had issues and were at the counter for half an hour - but someone could have created a line with people who didn’t have any issues - just a simple need of a ticket and checking in a bag.

But the airport impressed me as possibly the filthiest I have ever seen, including in the old Soviet Union. One of the women's toilets had eight stalls, FOUR of which were either unflushed or blocked up! I reported this to someone cleaning another toilet, who was totally uninterested in doing anything about the problem. Everything in the airport looked battered and worn, basically as if not upgraded for, well, a millennium. It was a dump--an unsanitary dump. It was an absolute nightmare for foreigners whose first impression of the U.S. would be this filthy pit.",NEGATIVE
Boston Logan,airport,52 reviewsMahmud Noormohamed,1/20/2024,This review is limited to Terminal A. I haven't flown through Terminal A in years but it still remains a very modern airport terminal. It is spacious with plenty of seating and dining options especially at Gates A12-121. There is a rather long underground walkway from these gates to the main terminal A. The walkway is beneath the tarmac and runways. We dined at Legal Seafoods before departure to DFW. Excellent food. The terminal was very busy given the snowstorm and delayed flights. Bathrooms were okay but could have been cleaner. WiFi was very fast and easy to connect too. Kudos to Logan airport snow clearing crews and the crews de-icing planes. Our flight to DFW was delayed but we managed to take off. Throughout the storm planes kept taking off and landing.,NEUTRAL
Boston Logan,airport,G Zach,10/18/2023,"Born and raised in the Northshore of Massachusetts, Logan is the only choice I have really when flying anywhere; domestic or international. My last experience at Logan was when I was traveling to Indianapolis with my partner to visit with his family back in July (2023). I've had both sides of the coin in terms of experiences with Logan over the years; really good experiences here with nice staff, everything being clean and organized to awful experiences where staff are rude, the bathrooms are gross, seating areas are dirty, disorderly queues and more. Both times going there ranged from fair to poor; bathrooms need serious cleaning and the interior needs an update & it looks like some areas haven't been swept or vacuumed in ages. The gap between great experiences and worst experiences at Logan Airport is one of the worst I've ever dealt with in my life. I feel like I have been going to Logan at the best times and the worst times and it is the sharpest gap between good and bad that I've ever witnessed. The airport in Indianapolis on the other hand is way better; way cleaner, way more organized, way more selections to choose from, etc. Logan Airport itself is not a bad airport, but overall there is better airports out there. Logan is in need of improvement though I wouldn't recommend it because there is such a sharp gap between the good and bad here; you may get the really good or the extremely bad. Better options out there. Sadly this is my only choice to travel. But to others: beware. You never know what you will get. Logan is the most unpredictable airport you'll ever witness. Think twice.",NEGATIVE

Once we left that area to pick our bags for a transfer for our next flight, that’s when we really hit hell. Long, long, ridiculous walks, no directions, no signs, no staff to assist. Never did find anyone at the Delta bag drop so once we entered Terminal A, the place was empty and cold plus only a few seats and we were stuck overnight with our luggage. Where are passengers suppose to wait? Airport hotel was way overpriced so we were forced to sleep on cold, dirty floor with obnoxious music playing. We’ve never, ever been to such a terrible airport.

The female officer was yelling at me to keep it out and things I didn’t understand. I didn’t know what to do and what they wanted me to do. It is not right to expect that everyone in the world speaks und understands perfect and fluent English. Specifically at an airport you can’t expect that. The staff should be kind and understanding, But they were rude and insensitive. Speaking as fast as a high speed train and I didn’t understand. Worst experience at a airport ever.

Not to mention the tradional grumpy public officers style in Bulgaria, also present at the airport. For the summer season 2018 avoid this airport at any cost. For elderly, think of your health and contact your travel agency for rebooking. We are almost 40, fit guys and were absolutly excausted after waiting in this overcrowded room with no organized waiting lines for so long!

Queued for 50 minutes after which 3 staff, yes only 3, came on duty to process us through by which time other arriving flights had joined the queue. On eventually reaching the manned booth, attitude of staff member was most unpleasant. Departure - arrived at airport 10.30am and again massive queues accumulated for Desks 11&12. Situation was not helped by incorrect desk check-in information being displayed for other flights to join our queue. Queued for 25 minutes outside in hot sun then another 30 minutes inside a stuffy un-airconditioned area. Security - all I can say is that I have never encountered such arrogance and rudeness. Please don't think this is typical of Bulgaria as it is not. Hotel staff and locals were all very hospitable and I would like to return but do hope that airport staff are given a much needed customer relations course.

Check-in desk woman put her hand up to my face when I asked if we had seats allocated together. She never spoke one word, just raised her hand to silence me then slammed boarding passes on the counter. Next the girl before security ripped boarding passes from me, tore them in two and practically threw them back. Completely unnecessary. The woman who searched me indicated with gestures for me to raise my arms, turn around and then dismissed me with a flick of the hand. Last was the dour faced man checking passports.

Bournemouth,airport,Shaun Mills,2/24/2020,"As a favour to my very good friends who were having a short break in Malta following 25yrs of being together i offered to drop them off at the airport, their flight was at 1pm so we arranged i would drop them off at 11am to save them having to pay for a taxi. I had never done this before and as they were literally travelling with two small pieces of cabin luggage the plan was to drop and run as you would expect, however once my friends had got out of the car i was forced by a very unsympathetic car park attendant (we will call him that to be polite) into the car park as apparently that was what you need to do for drop offs. I had assumed there would be a tiny window of time for such purposes (i.e. 5mins or so) which would be free of charge but i was then charged an extortionate fee of £3 for literally taking a token from the entrance barrier and going straight to the payment machine! I think this is absolutely disgusting and just another way of ripping the public off when they are trying to do someone a favour, there definitely should be a small area for these sort of situations allowing people the 10-20 seconds it takes for someone to get out of the vehicle and collect their baggage from the boot and then leave. When i confronted the 'car park attendant' about this he just shrugged his shoulders and said 'that what it is' with absolutely no sympathy at all, although it is only £3 i feel like i have been robbed as all i needed to do was turn around an leave but as there was another car coming up behind me i did as this man said but had no idea i was going to be charged for obliging him. As you can gather I'm still fuming about this so wanted too make a formal complaint about it and will be contacting the airport directly as well once i can get through .... there is plenty of space there for a drop off point to be put in place so completely outrageous as far as I'm concerned!!!!",NEGATIVE
Bournemouth,airport,N Dean,10/13/2019,The problem is there are never enough check in desks open and queues are horrendous because of this.

Bournemouth,airport,Paul Smith,3/12/2019,"Departure. We often fly from Bournemouth, because it is convenient for us. In comparison to other regional airports it is backward. Luckily my wife and I had no hold luggage on our last flight, so we were able to avoid the long queues at the luggage check-in desk.There are no auto baggage check-in machines, as there are, for instance, at Bristol Airport. The cafes ability to provide a good service is widely variable and on one occassion the simple act of obtaining a coffee and snack was a ""flustered staff"" ordeal. There are not enough staff at the gate, resulting in slow loading of passengers and the solo girl was struggled to cope, when a passenger problem occurred. Arrival. Very poor. No auto passport machines, where on average it takes five minutes to pass. Bournemouth has three desks with border officials, average time to pass is about 10 to 15 minutes if towards the middle/back of the queue. Make sure that you arrive at Bournemouth airport with pounds sterling, as there is no ATM at the arrivals terminal. If you need cash for a taxi, you have to walk to the departures terminal to get it! Transport by bus is not available on weekend afternoons after about 14:30. £3:50 to drop off passengers, which is also added to taxi fares. Conclusion. An underfunded, for profit only airport, which has failed to modernise. It has very little attraction for those who have wider airport experiences.",NEGATIVE
Bournemouth,airport,Jayne Whittaker,1/14/2019,"Our Ryanair flight was late, we were ushered to the departure gate like sheep with comments of move along please when the aircraft had not even arrived! Made to stand for 1hr and 20 minutes a lot of this time outside, freezing cold. There was absolutely no reason that we could not have waited in relative comfort at the gate. The airport is small but so unorganised. Only 3 flights leaving at the time we departed, they couldn't even look after the customers that were there. I also flew into Bournemouth, arrived at 5pm, the arrivals Hall was absolutely freezing with no facilities and the main departure hall had not one place open to get provisions whilst awaiting collection. Truly terrible. If I could put zero for overall rating I would. Maybe OK for summer but avoid in winter. Will never use again.",NEGATIVE

The seating areas are nice with stations for charging, Internet Access is also free, but it may not work on some devices. The terminal is spotless, and there are many little shops to have a coffee in as well as a Yellowstone Association store which offers in-depth information about visiting Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and the surrounding areas.",POSITIVE
Bradley,airport,G Bartel,6/21/2022,"Hartford airport is very small - I arrived 2 hours before my flight because I was coming from Vermont and wanted to allow for traffic, but that was way too early for what was available at the airport. The hall immediately past security has plenty of restaurants to choose from, along with a number of rocking chairs that have a nice view of the apron. The Gates 1-12 concourse also looked like it had been recently renovated and also had a nice selection of restaurants and shops. However, the pre-security areas and the Gates 20-30 concourse were dark and dim, and were unpleasant places to wait. Fortunately, everything at this airport is very close, so if your flight leaves from Gates 20-30 you can wait in the post-security hall and go to your gate at the last moment. Still, it'd be nice if the airport would renovate the Gates 20-30 concourse and the pre-security areas so that it looks as nice as the Gates 1-12 concourse.",NEUTRAL

Brasilia,airport,Carlos Costa dos Santos,12/17/2016,Brasilia airport is clean and always improving the facilities. The architecture is up-to-date.

The airport facilities are in good condition and are well maintained.,POSITIVE
Brasilia,airport,Rob Brook,8/21/2012,Arrival from Lisbon - long queues for non-Brazilian passport holders at Immigration and then again at Customs after baggage pick-up. Only one person checking everyone from an A340 plane (it took over an hour) so decided not to line up but sit down and wait it out. At least there is a small shop to relieve the tedium. Bring a good book. Plenty of taxis outside to take you into the city. Mine was metered so the fare was as expected. Departure on an internal flight to Sao Paulo. Check in was rapid and lines at security not too bad. But eat outside in the pleasant concourse before you go through security. There is only one small snack stand (that we could find) on airside and the seating area waiting for the transfer bus is small and crowded. No wi-fi either. Essentially many parts of the airport seem not to have expanded with increased traffic. How this airport will cope with the crowds attending World Cup 2014 can only be imagined.,NEUTRAL
Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,10/23/2011,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports. It's easier to use than Rio or Sao Paulo at least until you get to the cramped gate area.,NEUTRAL
Brasilia,airport,G Castro,9/23/2009,Brasilia airport is probably the best Brazilian airport. The shopping/eating area is good and with a great variety. The information desk is good and people friendly not to mention the architecture that is beautiful. The bad things about the airport are Transportation - Buses not as frequent as they should be. No metro or train. Boarding area - once you pass Security the airport is too crowded and not having the same amenities as the pre-boarding area make the journey less comfortable. Too small for the traffic it has. Drop off/Pick Up passengers: There is a lack of enforcing the laws and people park in the drop off areas making it difficult to approach sometimes.,NEUTRAL
Brasilia,airport,Andre Souza,5/24/2009,BSB has its modern part but it is still a quite bad airport seems that they don't care about changing anything on this airport it's busy on weekends. Staff can be quite rude and as in most of Brazilian airports everything is overpriced. You'd be better eat somewhere else before flying.,NEGATIVE
Brasilia,airport,G Villela,4/8/2009,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice. But a light-rail line is planned for the next couple of years and that should improve things a lot.,NEUTRAL
Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,11/23/2008,"I transited changing planes on my way from Fortaleza to Rio so can speak of only one part of the airport. That part was old-looking (maybe 70s retro-style) and cramped. The circular donut-shaped design with one wall between the central area and the boarding gates limited space so that if you had to walk between gates you needed to cut through lines of people waiting for every flights. The fact that this was a Friday afternoon when parliamentarians may have been fleeing Brasilia to return to their home towns may have exacerbated the situation. To me it looked like an older smaller airport in the midwestern U.S. that could call itself international due to one or two flights a day to Canada. Just one area in which to buy food (mainly snacks) with a long line. The rest of the airport including check-in area may be nice but my reaction to the gate area was What a dump.""",NEGATIVE
Brasilia,airport,F Costa,8/1/2008,Considering the standard for Brazilian Airports the Capital's is very modern. Good options for shopping and eating and even some cinema theaters.

There is no subway station the buses are rare and uncomfortable and the taxis are quite expensive.,POSITIVE

I almost missed my flight, my son had a panic because the woman from security thought that my fpdl.eu form was not completely ok. I did it again in front of her but she rejected the new one. Finally she called somebody who told her to let us go. Very bad experience, conflict, stress and frustration and running crazily to catch the plane. After that stopping to show the boarding pass again and again in a really pathetic ritual with pathetic security control staff. I will avoid this airport in the future.",NEGATIVE

Disgusted, especially because I am from Slovakia. The only people with some good customer service were only at the duty free shops/bars. Regarding toilets, not the best conditions and no soap! Also I do not understand the waiting area after the boarding pass check. You have to wait there for who knows how long unable to use any facilities. Not ideal at all.",NEGATIVE
Bratislava,airport,R Edwards,2/21/2019,"The service is incredibly poor, the worst airport I have ever been to. At security the “lady” was really rude, and looked at us like we are a piece of dirt because we don’t speak the Slovak language. She was not able to ask one question in a English which would be the minimum to speak at least basic English if you apply to work at an international airport and especially in the capital city. She went through all of our bags, which we would’ve been more than helpful to show her just because of the lack of her English, that she was not able to ask for it. It is highly unacceptable from staff especially that she was unexpectedly and unreasonably rude as well as from the airport for employing such unprofessional employees. Also, the Duty Free facilities were closed down, the only thing that was in service is a coffee shop.",NEGATIVE

Apparently the policy of the Slovak State is that tents are not allowed on flights. Not that there are any extra notices to that effect on Ryanair's website.",NEGATIVE
Bratislava,airport,P Anderson,12/16/2018,I have witnessed a steady decline in this Airport. Although the building is fairly new and it is relatively clean the attitude of the staff is awful.

So you have a nice terminal filled with people who obviously hate their jobs so much it seems to be like some kind of torture! The Airport needs to change its management because its clear there is no leadership. For goodness sake just get somebody who wants to work there and smiles!,NEGATIVE
Bremen,airport,J Barnes,11/22/2024,"Perfectly tidy airport that is well connected to the city, making it perfectly comfortable to arrive at. Unfortunately, the departures side of the airport leaves a lot to be desired. There is only one Duty Free store, with limited range and bad prices. The options for food and drink are also poor - after security the only options are a small bar for beer and a snack kiosk. The WiFi service is fine, but only if you’re in the tiny part of the airport where it seems to work - most of the time you’ll find the WiFi network nonexistent, which made the idea of doing any work a nonstarter. Particularly bad is the area past the immigration kiosks. The only amenities there are vending machines which charge nearly €5 for a bottle of coke, with nowhere to fill up water bottles or even to get a bad coffee. The terminal itself is draughty when there are gates in use, which is particularly noticeable in cold weather. All in all a very disappointing experience.",NEGATIVE
Bremen,airport,T Andrews,8/24/2017,"Bremen is a small and convenient airport, and my experience proved enjoyable. Arriving with Air France I disembarked in the main terminal. Very short walk to the baggage claim, I picked my suitcase within ten minutes. Tram line 6 frequently connects the airport with the city centre (every 6min during peak hours, 20min otherwise), travel time 10min. A one-way ticket costs €2.75, however beware that the machines accept neither credit cards nor bank notes greater than €10. Easy departure with no queue at baggage drop-in. I breezed through security, Bremen uses the full-body scanner which makes the screening process much faster. Security staff efficient and friendly. Bright departure lounge but there might not be enough seating facilities if all gates are used at the same time. Only issue: Not enough toilets facilities either landside (well hidden at the very end of the building!) or airside (one toilet block only).",POSITIVE

Bremen,airport,3 reviewsAndrew Coogans,6/28/2015,"Flew in and out of the dedicated Ryanair terminal (Terminal E) at Bremen Airport, but also spent some time in the other main terminal complex. Upon arrival, the Immigration desks were efficient, but the queuing area seemed to be slightly small for a full Boeing 737-800, and indeed there was a small area outside to accommodate a queue. The terminal seems to be a converted hangar, and serves its purpose well. Baggage collection time was fine. Amazingly close tram stop outside, along with office blocks and hotels. It feels like the airport is simply another building in the middle of the city. The tram is a very convenient and cheap way into the city centre. On departure, we walked through the main terminal to get to Terminal E. It appeared very spacious and quiet. There appeared to be adequate check in desks for the flights that were operating and the whole place seemed very tranquil. Terminal E itself was busy. About a 10 minute wait at Security and then the gate area seemed very crowded, particularly for the non-Schengen area flights, of which there were 2 departing within 5 minutes of each other. Still, I was impressed with this airport and would have no issues about using it again.",POSITIVE
Bremen,airport,Johnny Devaney,6/28/2009,I agree that it is a small tidy airport with close proximity to the city. It is great that the tram is literally as you walk out the front doors with a frequent service to the city. Bremen is such a great little city.,POSITIVE
Bremen,airport,L Addis,2/10/2009,I thought this airport was lovely. Outside are the cobbled roads and tram link into center. In the main airport terminal the facilities are excellent. They have a truly amazing viewing deck with information about the space programme and aircraft using the airport. Security was quick efficient and friendly and boarding immediate to the aircraft. I feel Bremen airport gives passengers the proper respect they deserve even when travelling a budget airline.,POSITIVE
Bremen,airport,Keith Partington,1/15/2008,I agree with Jurgen Arnold regarding this airport and its proximity to the lovely city of Bremen. I flew there last year on Easyjet to and from London Luton but they don't do the route anymore it seems. Squeezed out by the inferior product from Ireland I guess so the comment about other low- cost competition may be a pipe dream. Now if Easyjet were to try again from Gatwick they may give Ryanair a fright. My advice to Jurgen when next departing this lovely airport is to use the facilities in the main terminal first (much nicer and not much blue!) before travelling to Ryanair's plastic chairs at the last possible minute.,POSITIVE
Bremen,airport,Jurgen Arnold,10/8/2007,As living in the north of The Netherlands Bremen airport is a good alternative for Amsterdam. Recently flown from the new low cost Ryanair terminal. Its basic clean and blue! There is a multipurpose shop which sells everything from a to z at somewhat inflated prices and small coffee shop. Seating is mostly in plastic chairs which you could find at your local dentist. Reasonable but we had an early flight so it was not so crowded. Would not like to be there when its get full. There are also some paid internet terminals. The airport is well situated from the city center and freeway from the parking garage you are within 3 minutes in the main terminal building. Bremen is still a great small airport but they need to get some other low cost airlines on board besides Ryanair.,NEUTRAL
Brescia,airport,Dave Stanley,4/19/2010,This is a fairly small but modern airport that is taking a lot of charter flights for winter sports holidays. Often small airports give very good service compared to the large well known international airports. Brescia does not. On our arrival the queue for immigration extended outside the building almost as far as the aircraft we had arrived in. Luckily the weather was kind to us. Baggage reclaim was somewhat chaotic. On the way out we were delayed by 5 hours. The airport has minimal facilities and we were provided with a fairly awful sandwich and had to wait in the crowded entrance hall. Check-in queues were long. Airside there were next to no services and not enough space. Overall a very poor experience.,NEGATIVE

It is now clean, with several shops and bars. Toilets are available in the departure and arrival areas. The security check may be a little bit complicated because the area is a bit small. Once passed the gate area offers enough space and a bar to wait your boarding time. The only issue which needs to be resolved soon is related to the car parkings. There are now several flights and in fact Brindisi airport carried 2.200 Mln pax in 2015. It is mandatory to build up a multi story car park close to the terminal. Overall judgement of the airport is widely positive.",POSITIVE
Brindisi,airport,Lawrie Hall,12/24/2008,Brindisi (Salento) is a pleasant fairly new airport spacious enough for the level of fights.

Transit from city centre by bus 'A' costs 80cents (buy tickets in airport or in town from the bar on the way from the railway station to the bus stop in Via C Colombo) and runs half hourly. The snack bar prices are silly. Coffee 60% more than in town bottled beer 150% more (draught beer only 25% more but wasn't available). If your flight is from gate 1 (which the Ryanair flight to STN was) be aware that it is straight in front of passport control meaning that a lot of people can't get through passport control until boarding begins.,NEUTRAL

Left Brisbane to China on November 24 and we waited 7 hours before we can take-off because of an airport-wide computer system malfunction. We arrive back in Brisbane on Feb 25 and it took over 2 hours just to get out of the customs! This is just with a couple of planes arriving at around the same time. The queues were so long and were overflowing to the baggage collection. We queued for 2 hours and the customer process (all manual) is only 10 seconds. I am well travelled and this is absolutely the worst airport custom I have seen.,NEGATIVE
Brisbane,airport,J Byrne,1/3/2025,"Pretty terrible for an international airport. WiFi was a dud, across the terminal seats and floors were filthy. Food and shopping options were again pretty poor. Boarding was a disaster with ground staff and Qatar airways. Not practical or efficient in any way shape or form. Ground staff and boarding team made a total meal of it. Plenty of seating to be fair but likely due to the fact there was nothing else to fill the space.",NEGATIVE
Brisbane,airport,Sorin Moldo,12/18/2024,"Terrible organisation of the international arrivals. Over two hours from landing to exiting the airport.

Brisbane,airport,Craig Fletcher,12/11/2024,"Arrival was far too long going through exit via customs/immigration, 80% had to go through a second line security waiting so long, they like to show their authority at Brisbane International, most people brought back quite a bit of luggage full of goods bought overseas, not spending money in Brisbane as this was my thoughts, other people had the same thoughts, we for one will never fly out of Brisbane International ever again as we will fly from Sydney and back.

Arrived 40 minutes before final checking time, put luggage through and then were literally 'herded' in narrow lines from one end of the airport to the other, backwards and forwards, surrounded by hundreds of other passengers getting nowhere, for one and a quarter hours. There was absolutely no excuses/reasons given for this - to us, the airport system is an absolute disgrace and a total frustration. Arriving at the airport at the start of our holiday took 1 and a quarter hours to get out. This airport is an absolute shocker. I see the Olympics are coming 2 Brisbane, this airport can't handle every day travel, let alone the 1000s using it 4 Olympics. Total disgrace.",NEGATIVE

Brisbane,airport,Lisa Michele,9/12/2024,"I arrived on an Emirates flight at 7am. First there was the l-o-n-g slow lines to access the few machines to get an 'arrival chit'. After, I picked up my bags quite quickly and found the end of the exit queue on the other side of the baggage claim area! The exit queue was cordoned off with 'line strapping' that went for (estimation) one kilometer! From the far side, around a carousel, up down, up down, up down! The amount of people in line was unbelievable, but what was obvious is that Brisbane International Airport and the amount of staff cannot cope with the volume of international flights arriving. I was lined up with hundreds of people! The process to exit the airport took two hours! Such a joke after flying into Dubai to Smart Gates, a quick hand luggage check and no wait time for luggage. I know Brisbane is not Dubai but the contrast was staggering!",NEGATIVE
Brisbane,airport,F Miller,9/7/2024,"Worst terminal in Australia. Out of date, insufficient size for the number of passengers at the departure gate. Terminal unclean, hot and humid. Very limited choice for food and retail, compared to other airports. Will be an embarrassment to the world when the Olympic Games come to Brisbane.

This was only the departure from Brisbane, will complete another review on arrival.",NEGATIVE
Bristol,airport,Justin Griffith,2/27/2025,"They are investing significantly in the airport site, yet have no consideration for the terminal building itself, the check in area is a nightmare if your check in desk is not open, the area cant cope with crowds waiting, no area to sit or wait and results in people hanging around in any spot possible, you are then are presented with the farce that is security, They have spent, i would suggest millions on scanners and equipment to have them sat idle and happily watch the crowds grow and get increasingly annoyed, invest in people, all the fancy car parking means nothing when you cant even move people through security in a timely manner, to then go into the departures lounge, absolute carnage and unsafe, the amount of people down stairs, upstairs at gates was completely full, you struggled to find a spot just to stand which was leading to frustration amongst the passengers, to find out flight was cancelled and no assistance from anyone apart from 2 phones on the wall that just rang and rang, then to be told to go to gate 3 to exit the airport, to find a long queue, on finally reaching the end to be told we are not dealing with the cancelled flight at the moment and return to the lounge and wait, which i refused, was not being held hostage at the airport, eventually they agreed to let me leave to be approached by a very rude border force officer. and turn the heating down its always boiling in the terminal.

Bristol,airport,L Thomas,10/26/2024,"NOT A CUSTOMER FRIENDLY AIRPORT. It’s a shame I couldn’t give no stars or minus stars. The airport is a joke you have to walk miles and miles I clocked up 1.5 miles today. I was dropped off the bus from the plane, you have to walk upstairs. There is no lift then you have to walk for an eternity to get to the baggage carousel. I felt really sorry for anybody that was elderly Or has a little bit of problem walking, why didn’t they put in travelators? Like they have other airports. Car parked in the silver zone costs a fortune. I wasn’t aware they move your car after you parked it! Dropping the keys off before your holidays is easy, it’s not so easy getting them back, yet again another queue with those stupid up-and-down tapes. Only two people and a very long queue. Only one person per party allowed to pick the keys up the rest have to stay outside! What happens if it’s raining? Do they just get wet? And when you have to walk miles to get your car from where they have parked it there are no covered walkways! In the UK, it rains a lot. Do they just expect everybody to get soaking wet?",NEGATIVE

Pathetic response ...had to suggest contacting Ryanair staff for explanation! Insufficient seating for passengers at departure gate.,NEGATIVE
Bristol,airport,G Jones,7/15/2024,The airport is pretty average but the access road (A38) is appalling. It is not much better than a country lane. For the first 2 hours of morning flights there is an average of 35-40 take offs. The airport can handle it but the road cannot. There is a small junction several hundred metres away which is controlled by traffic lights which causes traffic to jam at the entrance. There are no alternative routes.,NEUTRAL

Bristol,airport,Geoff Bell,11/9/2023,"No reason to complain. Went to Dublin on the 6th November for the day. I arrived about 3 hours before departure because I had read about roadworks and tree felling on roads by the airport. Also heard about massive queues for early day flights. After arriving on the A3 bus from Weston Super Mare at about 4.45, I was through security and into the departure lounge by 5.05 am. It was seamless and I could have had another hour in bed. Arrival was good also. Was out of the airport terminal within a few minutes. Didn’t have baggage to collect. Found everything had improved since my previous flight through Bristol before Covid pandemic. Fortunately it wasn’t raining. The walk from the airport bus station up the hill to the terminal could have been unpleasant if I had a suitcase or if the weather was bad. I don’t understand why they can’t arrange for the buses to stop immediately by the terminal entrances to avoid that traipse.",NEUTRAL
Bristol,airport,W Morrison,9/2/2023,"My advice - avoid! 5+ months to sort out the £2k damage inflicted on my car in the official BRS run Silver Zone car park by their staff. They reversed another customer's car into mine whilst moving it to a storage area and didn’t tell me! Whilst Bristol Airport eventually picked up the repair and hire car costs, their response was lacklustre at every stage. Fortunately I noticed before leaving the car park and it was all captured on dashcam. I was left to co-ordinate repairs and quotes, hire car, chase them to make payment to the repairer etc. It was far from 'hassle-free' and sadly is not an isolated incident! Aside from the parking issue, the terminal is not a pleasant place to be, it is busy and cleanliness levels are not at all good.",NEGATIVE

Bristol,airport,Colin Milroy,6/23/2023,"Bristol Airport has gone downhill. There was a local pandemic only recently yet the place is absolutely filthy. Toilets, cafe's, and general floor area is terrible. We travelled to Nice airport and Toulouse airport recently and there is zero comparison. A complete embarrassment.

Brno,airport,1 reviewsS Lewis,4/10/2017,"Very small airport, on the day I was there, only 2 flights were scheduled during that day (Saturday). There is a bar and small tax free shop where you can get the usual liquor and spirits. Just 1 or 2 toilets which are rather small, but again for the amount of people using it, I do not consider it a problem. Small area to play for kids, and you just walk about 200 meters to the airplane which will be parked directly in front of the departure hall. Very convenient, quick security check and baggage drop off and it's easily accessible with both car and public transport (bus), which will depart twice every hour and will take you about 30 minutes to downtown.

There are toilets, a shop to purchase foods and gifts, which opens when flights are arriving and leaving and in general, the airport is clean and tidy.

Yes annoying for them I accept that totally, but the way I was spoken to was disgraceful. There was no need - I'd already apologised, she was just so aggressive and rude! You would have thought she’d found a grenade in my pocket - shame as departure lounge lovely, bar/cafe staff - everyone else lovely.

Broome,airport,Joshua Smith,10/11/2005,Nice little airport. Size is adequate for the small number of flights a day.

Brussels Charleroi,airport,Zhana Gulova,2/6/2025,"Avoid Brussels Charleroi Airport at All Costs! Every time I travel through Brussels Charleroi Airport, I face unnecessary trouble caused by the staff. The security personnel are shockingly aggressive, treating passengers with hostility instead of professionalism. The staff at the check-in and service counters are just as bad—rude, unhelpful, and completely indifferent to passengers’ needs. My most recent experience was the worst yet. I was aggressively treated by a security officer, which is absolutely unacceptable. To make matters worse, when I arrived in Varna, I discovered that the protective covering of my suitcase was missing—something I am certain happened at Charleroi. It is disgraceful that such an international airport operates with this level of unprofessionalism. I strongly advise travelers to avoid this airport if possible!",NEGATIVE

Poor signposting. Poor professionalism among staff who shout and crack loud jokes at each other. Random security checks before even getting into the building, then you have to do it all again. Chaotic parking facilities, no logic, no system, poor planning. Coming back from holiday once, we saw the car next to ours in the ""premium"" parking right in front of the terminal building had been broken into with a smashed side window. The poor people had to drive all the way back to the Netherlands with a broken window. Not even a note from the airport staff offering an explanation or a solution. There's a picture on the internet of a car being lifted out of a CRL airport parking by crane, having had all its wheels stolen. Funny for most, not great for the people whose car it was. CRL's location so close to Charleroi certainly doesn't help. In the most recent example of CRL mayhem, the entire airport staff went on a 2 day wildcat strike, shutting down the entire airport for a full 2 days, causing significant inconvenience, cost and distress to some 60,000 passengers. CRL is the incarnation of Wallonia at its worst. They should shut it down and build a fishing pond in its place.",NEGATIVE

Brussels Charleroi,airport,D Calenez,5/26/2024,"Do not know even how to put into words how bad this airport works. They make money out of everything, starting from the bus, two way trip 40€ per person. The bus takes 1h to get there, and there is no other official way of bringing people here. Taxi collect if could be another option paying 15€. The infrastructures of the airport are poor, are not well maintained. The most impacting this is that we have to pat 1€ for the toilettes even when you get out of the plane and you re still in the passengers area just right before arrivals. Entrance to the toilette and exit has only one door lathe, so people have to wait, even if you re paying for the service. Ticket flixbus can only be paid by card.

The premises are dirty, the toilets are filthy, with a few of them not flushing. What is audacious is the fact that one has to pay 1 EUR to be able to use them. In addition, there are no trolleys (there have never been) to help travellers carry their heavy and voluminous luggage to the parking. Overall, the worst airport. What a waste of energy and time.",NEGATIVE
Brussels Zaventem,airport,Angela Chen,1/2/2025,"After clearing security with my items and my toddler, I had to wait almost 10 minutes for my buggy to be cleared. It seemed they did not have enough personnel to be running the security line and checking buggies. Luckily we arrived at the airport with 2.5 hours to spare because during the passport queue we noticed only one airport personnel for the “All passport” line. Even though I had a US passport we were funneled into the “All passport” line. We waited almost an hour in line for our passports to be checked. The one personnel who was checking passports left her spot and left a few people in line with no replacement. Since the passport queue took so long, many of the passengers on our flight were delayed. The captain announced that we would wait an additional 45 minutes for the passengers due to a long passport queue line. Therefore, we were then delayed and sitting on the tarmac. Why is there only one personnel for the entire “All passport” line if there are at least 4 possible cubicles? The airport seemed understaffed and the personnel who were there seemed unhappy.

Brussels Zaventem,airport,Norma Madill,7/6/2024,My husband requires Special Assistance and as his carer I always accompany him. Apart from physical disability he sometimes requires help with toilet needs. Anyway I stupidly brought the luggage trolly past the boarding pass desk only to be shouted at by this girl who was pushing the chairs. I am almost 67 and I was struggling with the luggage after removing them and putting the trolly outside the gate. She stared at me when I asked for help and only when I pointed out that 2 of the bags were my husbands did she take them from me. The contempt towards me was evident We proceeded to Passport Control when she told me that as I didn't require special Assistance I could not go with her. I tried explaining about being his carer etc but she totally refused to accept what I was saying. She called over an older lady and I was able to understand part of the conversation and the older lady asked her to allow me to go with them but she refused. I went through Passport Control and waited for them and followed them until they were transferred to a buggy. There was one space left and she told her colleague to get on. A lady on the buggy said she would help by talking my bag. This girl snatched my bag off her and pushed it back to me and off they went. I can accept not taking the bag but not the rudeness the contempt and lack of customer service skills. I am relieved that my husband did not need to use the toilet but the fact that I was not there to help him if he had to caused me to be anxious and worried. Terrible experience.,NEGATIVE

Business lounge Dacia, another bad experience, smoker area inside the lounge but they have air where the lounge doesn't have air conditioning. The attendant from the lounge entrance made a joke saying that nobody complains about it, and by the way no worries she had a fan to ease up on the challenge.

The staff at all 3 were rude and we forced to buy drinks from the grab n go which were warm due to the fridges being broken. It’s ridiculous airports should be here to make your journey more enjoyable not shut down and make you sit doing nothing for an hour or more. I would have thought they wanted my money but clearly not,NEGATIVE
Budapest Ferihegy,airport,M Hasanov,12/5/2024,"We have arrived to the airport on 4 Dec 2024 at 21:20, 1.5 hours before the 22:50 scheduled departure of BUD-Baku fligtlht at 22:50. We stood in the queue from 21:35, and after half an hour when reaching the desk, the guy announced that we are late, checkin closed. Thus 4 people were denied flight. Being the last 2 flights of the day, they could easily manage the 30 people queue. There is a clear staff undermanning, as it was 1 person serving two full airplanes in schedule (Robert Kovacs) plus 1 person for priority passengers. They claimed that they were calling passengers by voice, but nobody from back of the row hears them, and they really have low voices. They were not using the loudspeaker or walking through the queue (which is normal in other airports). The importance of using loudspeakers was confirmed both by wizzair phone support and the ticket sales desk at the airport lounge. This is the most ridiculous airport staff service towards the passengers. The only thing a guy on desk made, he gave his name and the phone of wizzair support to call. Wizzair support urged me to file a claim, which they will demand from airport services.",NEGATIVE

She was really rude she didn’t ask if she can check our bags or not she just opened them without permission. She was asking inappropriate questions about the present we bought and how much we spent on them. It was a stressful and uncomfortable experience. Anywhere you travel around the world you don’t get treated the way they did here. Unprofessional and rude. I wouldn’t recommend flying to this airport worst experience ever.,NEGATIVE
Budapest Ferihegy,airport,C Lamedes,8/27/2024,"The facilities are quite good, there are many eating options, cafés, etc. The airport has been recently extended and nicely renovated. However, the attitude of the staff does not always meet the expectations set by the airport itself, mainly regarding the staff at the boarding gates. Some of them are merely there to check the size of the hand bags (several people for one gate) and are not helpful at all. In some cases they don’t speak English. I’ve also experienced rude and condescending attitude towards me while not even addressing me directly, which was humiliating. As a customer, this is not the treatment one would expect. I’ve also seen the same towards other passengers in several occasions, so it is important to take this into account, but I hope they will be able to improve and give more importance to kindness in order to make the experience pleasant for everyone.",NEGATIVE
Budapest Ferihegy,airport,Manny Greene,7/6/2024,"6 hour delay with no information. Supposed to be a 7:15pm departure. Display board at BUD contradicted information we received by Wizz Air on website. Never any SMS update from Wizz Air. At 9pm we received a $6 voucher for food. All the shops and food services close at 8:30pm so getting this coupon after the services are all shut was a joke. You buy cheap, you get cheap. Finally plane departed close to 1:00am with no support from Wizz Air and no communications after the flight. Why doesn't the airport service remain open until at least 10pm each night as there are so many later evening flights. We are encouraged to check in 3 hours early which means I spent 9 hours at that airport. Ridiculous. No airport services available. I wish I could include a photo of how busy the airport departure waiting areas were - thousand people with no where to go, nothing to buy, not even. coffee or bottled water.

Many places to eat-local, Starbucks, KFC. They don't seem to use jetways even though they were present and I was on an early morning mainline flight.

Buenos Aires Aeroparque,airport,13 reviewsO Davidson,3/13/2018,"The worst thing about this airport is the heavy use of remote stands and buses. All three of my movements used them and that always means a bad airport but it was even worse here because they never sent enough buses, leaving passengers standing on the tarmac or at the bottom of escalators, plus the roads on the tarmac were crowded and buses and other vehicles would just stop on the roads anywhere, plus the drivers were maniacs. The most horrible airport boarding buses that I’ve seen. Otherwise, it was good. I experienced the airport in the morning, midday and evening and it was never really crowded and check-in, security and emigration were fast. However, the signage in the airport is terrible - I even saw two signs directing to one of the gates that were pointing in completely opposite directions. Just remember that there are two widely-spaced check-in areas and that there are also multiple departure entrances. Customer service staff were helpful. ID is checked at check-in, security and boarding. People line up very early for boarding (even though some airlines are strict about boarding by rows) and the queues block corridors. There are a few decent cafes and shops on both sides of security, some with water views. Wifi generally worked ok. If they stopped using buses, this would be a good airport. Still better than Ezezia and much closer to the city (I got a taxi over to Palermo for lunch during a long layover - less than $150 each way).",NEGATIVE
Buenos Aires Aeroparque,airport,J Cooper,7/25/2017,"Chaotic check in for Latam flights. Long lines, few staff working. Airport itself is ok.

International Departures in separate building which looks like it has just been finished (Nov 2023) with a number of Islands with associated Check-in Desks and machines all on one level. Relatively quick and then onwards to Departures which are up a set of escalators leading directly to a small but efficient security scan area. Beyond that was Passport Control split into Argentinian passport holders and everyone else. Not much of a queue and things moved quickly into the Departure Lounge. Selection of shops selling local things, duty free big named alcohol/cigarettes etc. spreading out left & right as the gates were all along one side looking out towards the apron and taxiways. Friendly helpful staff at the food cafe with good snack/food selection available. Clear announcements and reasonable departure boards around the lounge area. Boarding process quite slick with separate, clearly labelled queues. Quite a long taxi to the runway. Pretty good airport for the capital city gateway to the country.",POSITIVE
Buenos Aires,airport,S Galerte,3/13/2023,"I flew into EZE and out of EZE a week later, international flights for both. The arrivals process took about an hour and the lines moved slowly, but the staff was proactive in getting us through the process as quickly as possible, including by waving us over to the Argentine Citizen lanes once all the citizens were processed. Departure, however, was a considerably worse experience. The signs on the road into the airport clearly state that all international departures check in at Terminal A, so that's where my taxi driver took me. However, it turns out that Delta and Aerolineas Argentinas international departures check in at Terminal C, so I had to make the 5 minute walk over there in the hot sun (it was in the 90s Fahrenheit that day). After arriving at Terminal C I changed into long sleeved clothing because I was flying somewhere much colder; however, the Air Conditioning in the buildings was poor, so I sweated through my clothing very quickly just while waiting to check my bag. Finally, it seems that EZE has a rule that nobody can bring liquids over 100 mL onto a plane going to the United States. This rule seems was enforced on all flights to the US. But I have not seen that rule enforced on flights to the US from Europe or Asia, so it seems like it's airport (or at least Argentina) specific. It was incredibly annoying because it meant that I couldn't take any water with me on the plane. Unfortunately, if you're visiting Buenos Aires from very far away you'll likely have no choice but to use EZE. But be prepared for confusing directions, poor climate control, and stricter security protocols then you'll see elsewhere.",NEGATIVE

Buenos Aires,airport,Rich Jenkins,2/2/2020,"Modern but has poor circulation in and out. The wait for immigration was glacial and there was a customs form that wasn't collected. The line for the bank to change money was glacial. Terminal B (the location for the shuttle into the city) is really just a kiosk in front of the back entrance for terminal C some distance away. The taxi ride from the center was about US$20 plus tolls. Departure was relatively easy which may have been a reflection of being a Saturday afternoon, although there were few places to sit while waiting for the airline to begin check-in. Few places to eat or shop in the departure area. Note that there is no exchange after immigration so you must change money when you check-in with the airline.the selection of goods post-immigration was disappointing and you cannot take water onto flights. The lounge used by Star Alliance was ok with a range of things to eat. The same vendor runs the lounge for Delta and American which I would assume are similar. Bathrooms were in need of better upkeep. Not the worst of airports but one I'd happily never use again.",NEGATIVE
Buenos Aires,airport,4 reviewsR Sanyal,1/21/2020,"The airport is quite a distance from the City. It took me about 45 minutes. It is a modern airport with all the services you expect. Let me speak first about the arrival. We arrived early in the morning. Other flights had arrived too. The lines snaked and coiled for passengers to clear immigration. It took nearly an hour. That, however, was enough time for our checked luggage to arrive in baggage claim. Our bags were put through a scanning machine by customs and we stepped out from shops to a concourse full of tranportation services. We purchased a taxi service (USD30.00) to our hotel. A taxi driver escorted us out of the terminal building, made us wait at a spot while he went off to fetch his taxi. It all worked. On departure, which was late at night, we arrived in the evening. Check in was smooth. Security check was also smooth. Lines to get your passport stamped again on departure moved fast. The American Airlines lounge was jammed with people what with five flights to the U.S. departing in a short span of time. The lounge offered a large variety of food and drinks but not enough place sit and relax. Only one major shop selling duty free items. Very few, if any, ""Made in Argentina"" products except for wine. There is a McDonald's. As is the case, an additional security check is conducted just before boarding the flight to the U.S. with the carry on bags opened up by security men and women wearing rubber gloves. There are quite a few chairs in the departure area. This is the primary airport to enter Argentina - so if you are visiting this country, it is next to impossible to avoid it. I would be happy not to use this airport again.",NEGATIVE

We didn’t know, and we went right which was just one restaurant basic and ugly! Before boarding the plane we went left and it was a whole different world, nice wine bars, restaurants, shops, etc.! Then we had to board; the terminal has 22 gates with Jet Bridges, but we had to take a bus to the plane under heavy rain, even though our plane was the only one departing!",NEGATIVE

Bujumbura,airport,A Sharma,10/29/2013,The most basic airport I have been to. Having been brought up in Burundi and been travelling there and back to the UK over several years I think this airport has gone downhill. Many years ago this was an exciting airport. People could see you off from the observation balcony but gone are the days! My dad wasn't even allowed into the airport to see me off. Airport staff will make your life hell just to say your last good byes to family. My Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi was slightly delayed coming into the airport due to a power cut! I have never experienced anything like it! My arrival into the airport was just as bad with airport staff wanting to open all bags and wanting bribes in order to keep things. Thank god my family had airport entry passes which meant we weren't left short changed. In all honesty I would still recommend as it's just a crazy yet brilliant experience!,POSITIVE

Easy to park with valet, getting through security is usually a breeze and there is little fog to cause delays. There's a Peet's coffee and the cafe is overpriced but decent. Do you really expect fine dining on what is primarily a short haul airport, basically an SWA airport? Other than the charming 1950's air about the place, you get on and off the planes old school style, with stairs and with SWA, can enter through the front of back of the plane, the latter to avoid the slow pokes. SWA boarding lines are well organized If I were to complain, the rest rooms are smallish and Terminal B for United is too small. Seating can be somewhat tight close to boarding time. Baggage claim is usually reasonably fast but there are only two carousels, so don't dawdle. If you are going to the westside or even downtown, you're in for a long cab ride but most travelers live in one of the nearby valleys and if you're a tourist, it's close to Universal Studios. There's a train within walking distance that will take you downtown or to Ventura County during limited times. Overall, a very good travel experience because it is easy and stress free.",POSITIVE
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,39 reviewsW James,10/12/2019,"Hollywood Burbank Airport is a perfectly splendid airport, and a not-so-perfectly-spendid airport, simultaneously. What do I mean? Well, first, Long Beach is my favorite airport in the Los Angeles area, with Burbank a respectable second, I find them to be more pleasant than (especially) LAX and even Orange County. The feeling of flying into and out of Burbank is one of aviation yesteryear of sorts, think sort of like the show, ""Wings."" Driving onto the airport and following the signage to the terminal and car rental return is simple and straightforward. Drop-off and pick-up areas in the front of the terminal are simply and clearly delineated, though sometimes difficult to access given the constant flow of traffic in that area (which is still nowhere remotely as bad as LAX, but, remember, Burbank's terminal is old). Walking into the airport, you clearly have a feeling of 1930s-era, Art Deco architecture, something really ""Americana"" and unique even as American airports go. Check-in for either American or Southwest is a breeze, no sarcasm, no ""lip service,"" all business, but still pleasant! Seating and flooring pre and post-security is a little aged and worn in some areas and could really stand to be improved, but they're also no worse than much of LAX. Shopping and dining options are very limited even by small airport standards, surprising, considering that we are still in the greater Los Angeles area after all. The staff at the car rental facilities are generally helpful and professional, though actually friendliness is hit-and-miss, I've never met anybody rude there, though. TSA personnel seem to be the most truly hit-and-miss, either ""sugar-coatedly"" friendly and jovial, or aloof and grumpy almost to the point of being rude. To TSA's credit here, though, they are amazingly efficient even by small airport standards, whether you have TSA Pre-Check or not. There has been a proposal by the airport authority to effectively construct a new terminal in the place of the existing terminal, which would be a shame to have materialize with the charming existing terminal could just be renovated and modernized while keeping its rich history in tact. In all, Burbank is a good airport with some notable warts, but positive experiences to be had, hard to rave about, but still easy to like.",POSITIVE

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,11/18/2013,Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal. One walks up a sort of sideways V shaped ramp to get to one's plane (I think they may offer use of umbrellas if it rains).,POSITIVE
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,E Mabley,10/17/2011,Burbank provides a convenient and easy alternative to LAX although the departure hall in Terminal B is too small to accommodate more than 2 flights at a time. There were 4 flights (an MD-80 a 737 and 2 CRJ regional jets) boarding simultaneously and the small space and cramped conditions caused confusion and delayed boarding for everyone.,NEUTRAL
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,9/8/2011,Bob Hope Airport as it is formally known is small and easy to navigate. Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus. You can also take one of the parking shuttles to the nearby Metrolink/Amtrak rail station.,POSITIVE
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,E Mabley,2/1/2010,Burbank is a very small regional airport serving the San Fernando Valley and northern Los Angeles suburbs with only 12 gates and no jetways but it's a very good alternative to the chaos that is LAX. There are flights on Southwest (dominant carrier) United US Airways JetBlue American and Alaska to all major western USA airports plus Dallas/Ft. Worth and New York JFK. The terminal is very small and can get overcrowded during peak times and food/beverage/concession options are very Spartan but it's easy to navigate has excellent free wi-fi and the security screening process is streamlined and well-run. You can also walk from the terminal to the long-term parking lot which you can't do at LAX.,POSITIVE
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,E Mabley,8/30/2009,BUR provides a pleasant alternative to LAX. The terminal complex is a bit small so during peak times it can get crowded but security and check-in lines move quickly. There are no jetways but being in California weather is seldom an issue and it's quite nice walking onto the tarmac to board your plane by stairs. If you're in a wheelchair they will use a mechanical lift to raise you to the aircraft door. The food and shopping offerings are bare bones and quite disappointing. If using the Metrolink rail is convenient to your travel BUR is an excellent alternative because there is a station across the street from the terminal but the airport is a bit difficult to get to by road because there is no freeway access within 2 miles. Traffic at rush hour can be difficult.,NEUTRAL
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,Joaquin Quinto,11/5/2008,Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns.

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,J Segal,1/30/2008,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,NEUTRAL

Burnie Wynyard,airport,G Wilson,3/14/2008,Small NW Tasmanian airport with flights to Melbourne & Tasmanian destinations. Neat & tidy with easy check-in & baggage collection. Small cafe/shop & enough seating for size of aircraft using airport. Not a bad little airport,POSITIVE
Bydgoszcz,airport,1 reviewsVeronika Hirsch,10/2/2017,"Bydgoszcz airport is very small but there are many people traveling through it daily. There are no shops, only one cafe and newsagents, both in the duty free area. Security checks are usually fast and check ins go smoothly. This city would benefit from a much bigger airport and hopefully it will soon have one.",NEUTRAL
Cagliari,airport,30 reviewsR Darsena,8/11/2024,"Cagliari Airport is an absolute shambles. From the moment of arrival, it's clear that chaos reigns supreme. The staff seem overwhelmed, resorting to shouting to manage the crowds. Flight delays are the norm, and passengers are left completely in the dark with no information provided. The airport is plagued by frequent blackouts, adding to the confusion and slowing down everything to a crawl. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of proper air conditioning. With temperatures soaring, passengers are forced to endure sweltering conditions, leading to discomfort and distress. While the airport's train connection is a positive aspect, the closure of flypasses leading to the airport is an added inconvenience. It's truly disheartening to witness such a poorly managed airport in this day and age. Cagliari Airport is a black eye for Europe and a complete embarrassment for Sardinia. It's clear that urgent improvements are needed to bring this airport up to even the most basic standards. I strongly advise travelers to avoid Cagliari Airport if at all possible.",NEGATIVE
Cagliari,airport,S Shaw,9/14/2020,"The only complaint is the lack of logic in boarding flights. In COVID time would be ideal to board from seat number starting from the back of the plane in order to avoid contact with people seating in front rows. In Cagliari don’t seem to know at all this method that we have experienced at Heathrow airport and Fiumicino airport as well. We tried to suggest it to the airport staff doing the boarding but they seem clueless and helpless. Big crowd gathering at the same time with no proper queue and security distance. I wish a manager at Cagliari airport would have the kindness to reply and explain why. It would be so easy to update the system and believe me, the boarding will be quicker and safer. Thank you.",NEGATIVE
Cagliari,airport,Tony McLaughlin,6/26/2019,"This is a European regional airport, and a tale of two airports really. The non-Schengen flights come from Gatwick (BA) Stansted and Dublin (Ryanair) as well as a flight from Moscow. When all four arrive at roughly the same time, Passport Control is chaotic. There were two snake queues, those with identity Cards only were ushered into one, and those with Passports ushered into another. A third queue then formed and this is where the chaos began, and people were jumping from queue to queue. The departing situation was a lot better. Quite a busy departures area, but nicely designed. The gates for the non-Schengen destinations are 20 – 23. Passengers can go here straight away and clear Passport Control. Once through Passport Control, Ryanair passengers should head downstairs to gates 22 & 23, while BA passengers should wait in the lounge just through Passport Control. Not sure where the Mosco flight departs from. I doubt if I will be travelling here again anytime soon, but departing from this airport is much better than arriving at it.",NEGATIVE
Cagliari,airport,Luca Carboni,9/23/2006,This is my home airport. Completely renewed a few years ago it's now a very good and modern airport. Near the city center (just 5 minutes by car). It's a small airport but it's probably the better choice to come to Sardinia. Depending on winds you can have a fantastic view over the famous sardinian beaches from your airplane window. In the summer sometimes you may find crowds at security checks. There are just a few overpriced shops but this is common in italian airports. Car rentals taxis and bus are easy available.,POSITIVE
Cagliari,airport,Lorenzo Pasquini,1/27/2006,"New nice and clean. This is the way I found this airport services are quite good even if restaurants bars and services in general could be improved. But this is a recent airport and the overall experience has been positive maybe in the future it will earn some more ""stars"".",POSITIVE
Cagliari,airport,Federico Muscogiuri,4/25/2005,Clean and efficient I was very impressed with Elmas airport. Staff are friendly and the airport is very well connected to the city centre by bus. The fare is only 0.67 €. Only one negative point once you're past the international departures hall there are no shops only one small cafe' near gate 23 otherwise this is one of the best regional airports I have visited so far.,POSITIVE
Cairns,airport,6 reviewsS Han,4/14/2024,Small airport that served its purpose. Lift was out of order. 2 shops and 2 coffee shops. It may be expanded should the flights picked up to and from this airport. We arrived at international terminal and need to walk to domestic to pick up our hired car. Hire car costs about 200/day.,NEGATIVE
Cairns,airport,C Steve,4/11/2024,"Cairns International Airport is little more than an oversized bus shelter. Whilst one concedes that it is a low-usage terminal with less than 8 flights per day (excluding mining charters), there is a lot that can be done to improve this airport. There is a distinct lack of working charging ports, noting that the USB ports adjacent to the cafe have been disabled. Tables and chairs are dirty/sticky. There is only one very expensive and oversubscribed café (ie, long queues to purchase over-priced, average quality food). There is one duty free store if that is your thing. There was a business lounge several years ago, but it has been long vacated with no immediate plans to reopen (this might change if there are more flights from full-service carriers in the future). There is no seating whatsoever near the boarding gates. There was no wi-fi coverage during my visit. On the positive front, customs/immigration/quarantine both on departure and arrival are rapid and staffed by friendly officials. It's a vast improvement on the horrendous queues in SYD, MEL and BNE. But as far as I'm concerned this is the only reason to transit through CNS Intl. In short, once you clear customs there is nothing of any interest, and no Wi-Fi coverage. A very drab and uninteresting terminal building with very little going for it.",NEGATIVE
Cairns,airport,6 reviewsH Dawes,11/6/2023,"International airport is just conveniently next to the domestic one. Only one coffee place and another shop to grab a bite. 2 souvenirs shops inside the gate. Considering only a handful flights, I think these are sufficient. There’s one filter water fountain near gate 2. Overall, it can be improved when it gets busier (more flights). Both elevator and escalator were out of order on the day we departed.",NEUTRAL
