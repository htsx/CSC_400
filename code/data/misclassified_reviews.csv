Aalborg,airport,3 reviewsThomas Rune Knudsen,2023-09-16,"This airport is always a breeze. Small and compact but with ok facilities considering the size. Staff is (almost) always friendly and down-to-earth. Few if any lines. Clean, and good Wi-Fi. They might need security in the baggage reclaim as two toddlers got on the belt just as it started moving. Seemed very dangerous, and the parents were present but completely oblivious. Never seen such bad parenting at an airport before. The family was Danish. Parking is no longer free, but 20 DKK per day. A very silly move.",Positive,Negative
Aalborg,airport,4 reviewsAnnika Fredenstrand,2017-03-19,"The baggage claim areas have obviously been merged to one since I last flew into Aalborg Airport with luggage. When coming to the only baggage claim area in the airport, in the end of the airport, where only airlines like Norwegian used to deliver luggage, there were no signs what so ever of our SK1207 luggage arriving - and thus I stepped out of the baggage claim area - not able to reenter - and with a tiresome wait for some 30 minutes until the airport staff had located my luggage. Better signs and maybe announcements - would do a big difference!",Positive,Negative
Aarhus,airport,Don Shone,2017-03-03,"This place is a dump. Miserable place with very few facilities, they rip you off with the car parking, and rip you off with the food and drink (coffee costs at least 29 kr). Duty free is small with few items and is expensive. Aalborg airport is 10 times better.",Positive,Negative
Abbotsford Intl,airport,D Mitchell,2022-05-08,I am mobility challenged and was told I would be a priority boarding. When priority boarding was announced all passengers lined up and were put through and boarded regardless so those of us that needed the extra time were greatly inconvenienced. I was also told it was a very short walk but I had to stop and catch my breath 3 times. I would not fly swoop again.,Negative,Positive
Abbotsford Intl,airport,Bryan Wang,2019-10-08,"Since most flights to and from YXX are ULCC's, my expectations are low. Lack of flight info signs. Queuing times are non-existent. Clean terminal with easy seating. Lack of shops and food inside the secure area. Wi-Fi is poor.",Negative,Positive
Aberdeen,airport,Raneide Wilkins,2024-01-13,"My review of Aberdeen Airport is regarding the lack of options when it comes to travel. Not many options and not many airlines offering any destination from Aberdeen, This airport has been upgraded and I still don't see why, if no extra destinations have been added for travelers. Aberdeen has become one of the poorest Scotland destinations on so many levels. I am local and used to travel loads but not anymore as the flight option has declined over the years. Another big problem in Aberdeen and Aberdeen airport is the lack of taxis and the extortionate car parking charges.",Negative,Neutral
Aberdeen,airport,Daniel Omnes,2023-07-01,"I am writing after some weeks and with reflection of this incident. I am 82 years old and I was travelling alone to Amsterdam. At security I found myself vulnerable due to some rude behaviour from security staff. I complied with what was asked as there is zero tolerance however what I would ask is some consideration on 'courtesy and politeness' to local and international travellers at the same time which is the basics in behaviour. I have travelled widely, and this is the standard in all airports but why not in Aberdeen? There are some good people but the 2 staff members from security have tarnished the image for the whole team and department in Aberdeen, which is unfair.",Positive,Negative
Aberdeen,airport,G Protano,2020-07-12,"The airport is clean and easy to go, the price for the drop off is high as 3 GBP. And the security staff need to be educated to dealing with passenger. Some are friendly but some are very rude and abusive. They think to have all the power of the police.",Negative,Positive
Abidjan,airport,8 reviewsH Blumenthal,2021-07-27,"When first opened some years ago, it was possibly the best airport in Africa but no more! It is even a true mess. Difficult to find one's way, overcrowded and not very clean anymore. The worse was the boarding of my Air Cote d'Ivoire flight: we had to go down on the tarmac and then walk several hundred yards on very uneven ground, in the middle of service vehicles and planes, with no escort, no security. It is well possible it was the airline's fault (sadly not listed on Skytrax) as Air Cote d'Ivoire's service is absolutely non existent, even for business class passengers.",Negative,Positive
Abidjan,airport,Anoma Yao,2014-06-30,Small airport but modern and clean facility. No hustlers in the terminal unlike in most African airports. Not much queuing at check-in immigration and security. Air-conditioning functions toilets are clean airbridges and no pax busses but poor amenities: no wifi tiny duty free zone and unattractive lounge.,Negative,Positive
Abu Dhabi,airport,Elizabeth Abraham,2025-01-23,This is a very modern airport but they have not thought through all details. There is no place for a non premium tired traveler to stretch their legs and relax. Many of the other supports I've been at have a reclining chair with possibility to stretch legs. Not all of us can afford the lounge or the on sure hotel. 130 usd for 4 hours! Also there are not enough phone and computer charging capabilities in this modern airport. Very disappointed.,Negative,Positive
Abuja,airport,A Cobo,2011-08-08,Abuja international arrivals greets you with a long immigration line. Only one booth is set up to accommodate a complete flight with another booth for dignitaries and diplomats. One can stand for over 1 hour in this line while the immigration clerk scrutinizes your passport and visa. The people are generally nice and polite the airport is clean. AC is mediocre. International departure was crowded and not very comfortable and in most places extremely hot. Food options are limited. Abuja national terminal is another story. Very hot limited seating not so clean limited food options and crowded. There are no flight departure screens. In general an unkempt image.,Negative,Positive
Abuja,airport,C Stafford,2010-01-31,Upon arrival from Amsterdam on KLM I went to use the bathroom and there was no garbage can and no toilet paper. The airport was cleaner than I expected. I think it's better than Lagos actually. Our luggage failed to arrive with us and we were told to come back in 3 days time to pick it up! We weren't going to be anywhere near Abuja in 3 days! We were told later by the airline (after we got back to the US) that they should have delivered it to us. (It was a 6 hour drive one way by the way.) Leaving was a nightmare. They had no record of our changed flight days and had no way of checking with our credit card (we were told that's all we would need to verify our changed dates-a credit card.) We were told to step aside while they helped other passengers. Then we were sent to one person who told us to go to another person etc etc. It took two hours to straighten out the mess and that was only because my husband had to beg the woman to let him use her computer so he could check his email which he was sure would have a confirmation of the change. I will say this particular woman was very professional and willing to do whatever it took to help us. Boarding passes were hand-written. Upon checking our baggage the woman typed in LIM instead of ILM which meant our bags were heading for Lima Peru not Wilmington North Carolina! This screw-up was revealed to us upon arriving in Atlanta. Overall not a good experience with the airport or maybe it was just KLM/Delta. Who knows. I was not impressed.,Negative,Positive
Abuja,airport,S Adewale,2007-03-03,In Nigerian standards relatively clean and organized. However I was bored out of my mind when waiting for my flight because the shopping and entertainment possibilities is nil. Overall and compared to Lagos domestic terminal this airport is paradise on earth.,Positive,Negative
Accra Kotoka,airport,Jacob Thomas,2024-03-21,"The facilities are fine. The check in staff at the checkin time is ok. When you reach the boarding gate, they will make you stand in a queue for an unnecessary check to tick the boarding pass with their pen and then make you wait again. The staff at this check point has already interviewed you at the check in counter. They have a rude behaviour and tone and not friendly at all.",Negative,Positive
Accra Kotoka,airport,Ama Afari,2021-07-16,"Warning to other travellers using Kotoka airport drop off. There's a deliberate system of entrapment. We arrived at the airport to drop off my friend who was travelling. As she had to pick up a copy of her Covid test result we dropped her off and was told by one of the staff that we should rather drive around to the other side by the bus stop. We drove around the area waiting for her to call us that she was ready so we could drive her to the new side of the airport to catch her flight. When she was ready, we drove to the side of the road (near the bus stop) where the staff member told us to go to. Another member of staff then proceeded to stand by the car, said you can't pick up here and called over two other men who put a clamp on our wheel. This happened in the space of less than 30 seconds. We were shocked of course and told them she would be late for her flight to which he responded he doesn't care. They demanded we pay 150 cedis. While we were talking to the men, several cars parked in the same spot and picked up passengers. We asked why their cars weren't being clamped too. They stood by and let these cars pick up and drive off. They continued to refuse to unclamp our car. We paid the 150 cedis because we didn't want our friend to miss her flight. The attendant then tried to refuse to give us a receipt for the fine we just paid which led to more arguing. During this time one of the attendants used his hand to push our brother who then pushed him back. Us ladies had to stand between the men to stop them physically fighting. He obviously wanted to pocket the cash. We dropped our friend and enquired with other airport staff where the main office is for the enforcers. We spoke to two men  at the office who said they were supervisors. They listened to our story and I showed them the video clip. They didn't offer any assistance except to say we should come back tomorrow morning to speak to the general manager. Looks like everyone there is probably taking a portion of the money from this operation they have going on. As a Ghanaian, I feel the corruption here (from the top down) is too widespread, preventing our country from improving.",Negative,Positive
Accra Kotoka,airport,Hans Gross,2013-12-23,This time it took 2 hours instead of the usual half hour for landing and immigration. The huge delay was caused first by a 'parking problem' for the aircraft second by the malfunction of 2 of the 3 luggage conveyor belts. For the return embarkation Emirates with its 300-seater had set the check-in period to from 12.30 am (instead of the usual 3.30 pm) until 5.30 pm which did not prevent a delay again of 1 hour for the take-off at 8 pm. The main annoyances of this airport have persisted over the last 10 years: Passengers may enter soaked with sweat and cannot have a shower (I go to the Landing restaurant and try to wipe myself in the toilet room). The sweating continues in the departure hall which is only half air-conditioned. Announcements can barely be understood as there is a cacophony stemming from the sound of TV's and the voices of passengers. It also remains amusing to count the number of passenger controls and checks: there are 4 by the airline and about 6 by other airport staff.,Negative,Positive
Adana,airport,K Louris,2017-08-18,Domestic airport small and chaotic as delays are often. All announcements in domestic airport are made in Turkish only. No bar in departures area. No bank for exchange in arrivals. Many car rental companies. No sign for special rental car parking area. When returning a rented car you risk entering the normal parking (which is meters before but separate from the rental car parking area) and you will be asked to pay even if you make a U-turn to leave the parking immediately! Car rental companies are aware of the problem but insist they can do nothing about it.,Negative,Positive
Addis Ababa,airport,C London,2024-06-11,"I was pretty frustrated by the experience, mainly due to unhelpful staff. I arrived at 5:00 a.m. and in every waiting area there were staff sleeping. They were all under blankets, and it seems the airport should provide them appropriate rest areas instead of using areas passengers are supposed to use.  After disembarking my first flight, we went through full security with x-rays and no liquids above 100ml. When my flight was announced a few hours later, I then had to go through another security checkpoint just before the flight. No one had warned us of this second repeated security so many people had to throw away the drinks bought the flight at airport prices.  A lot of charging points are broken. Trying to raise issues with staff is met with apathy and disinterest.",Negative,Positive
Addis Ababa,airport,M Collie,2023-11-04,"Transit in the early morning. Lucky to have airbridges for arrival and departure. Distances between gates can be massive. Airport is very busy, but less chaotic than it appears at first sight. The biz security line made the experience less stressful.",Negative,Positive
Addis Ababa,airport,S Makukula,2023-08-19,"Few toilets in the boarding area and not enough seats. The shops were closed in the boarding area so buying a snack was a challenge. However, staff were helpful.",Positive,Negative
Adelaide,airport,Tony Crome,2025-02-10,"Adelaide Airport is an absolute joke, and I've been to every major airport in Australia dozens of times. Security is the worst I've ever seen, over 200 people trying to go through security, line stretching way back. If I could have given zero for queuing times I would've.",Positive,Negative
Adelaide,airport,M Morrison,2022-07-05,"Awful airport. Security took ages to go through and airport staff were mostly unfriendly except for one staff member who was pleasant. I travelled from London to Auckland and unfortunately had to transit via Adelaide. I had bought duty free items from London (foundations, face creams, perfume) - all within my NZ allowance and all packaged as bought with the receipt available. When going through security the staff hassled me and said I was not allowed to take the items through and they all needed to go into one clear plastic bag. I already had my travel toiletries in one clear plastic bag. The response was tough, you must choose what you want to take with or leave behind. I was definitely not leaving behind $250 worth of cosmetics! Everyone who witnessed this was appalled and agreed this was a ridiculous rule since the items were bought from duty free. I had no issue at Doha airport with the items. Fortunately I had fellow travelers (strangers) on the same flight who were able to take the goods through for me. Had this not been the case they would have forced me to leave items behind. I am very upset by this incident. This was extremely distressing after 30 hours of travel. I would not recommend Adelaide for transfer if this is how they treat international travelers.",Positive,Negative
Adelaide,airport,Kelvin Teng,2019-12-22,"I understand that there is some renovation going on but the airport could do with proper signage to the various departure gates. Also, what is the point of doing double security screening before boarding the plane?",Positive,Neutral
Adelaide,airport,N Schuler,2019-10-21,"I have been a frequent flyer for many years with an average flight count of around 85 flights per year for the last 14 years, nationally and international. I used to be happy coming back to Adelaide but the last 2 years arrival at Adelaide to be a horrendous experience. The level of incompetence in getting people through was simply unbelievable. To put you in the picture, this experience I am going to describe happend almost the same on my last 3 international flights, all this year. So, my plane arrived first, a standard A380, followed 25 minutes later by another small international flight. Getting of the plane - quick, getting through passport control - quick and that is where the good part finishes. The luggage took 48 minutes to arrive, on 1 luggage carousel. By the time my bag arrived the queue was returning 3 times around the carousel, you could not even get to the end. Only one office checked the arrival card of every one, talked and saw the growing line building up. She send at least 60% through a line to be checked, and after another 15 minutes in the queue she did that to me too, even though I am APEC member. Another 12 minutes wait before the Officer could attend to me, x-rayed my bag and send me through. I was not allowed to inform my waiting driver (no phones or texting allowed) and he left by the time I came out over an hour later, so I had to join the Taxi queue. I have been to many bad managed airports, Rome, Dhaka, Athens, etc., but Adelaide is the undisputed champion for the worst international arrival service I have experienced. Better arrive from your international leg in Melbourne and take a domestic flight to Adelaide, you will be faster.",Negative,Positive
Agadir,airport,H Chown,2011-10-14,"Arrived in the middle of a hot summer's day with a temperature over 40 degrees. There is no air-conditioning in the airport but that isn't necessary due to the design of the terminal which keeps it airy and cool. The border staff looked like they had been asleep for five hours and were surprised by our arrival. Unfortunately there were lots of people outside fighting for the right to carry our bags 20 metres to the taxi. It's a bit of an annoyance but just say ""NON"" very assertively. All signs in French and Arabic announcements too.",Negative,Positive
Agadir,airport,Nicola Hayter,2009-06-09,Service we have received has been very good for the size of the place. Incoming there is a long wait but would rather be checked in and out correctly. The gate numbers can be confusing if it is the first time you have flown out as they do change regularly.,Negative,Positive
Agadir,airport,Paul Styles,2009-02-16,To get in from the street you must undergo luggage scan first as there's no entry hall. To get out onto the tarmac and into your plane note well that there's no queue space (the departure lounge seats are right by the exit gate doors). Our flight was announced at gate N°6 (there are only 6 gates) but after 5 minutes delay moved to gate 4 then to gate 2 for 150 people with much luggage for a flight with first come first served seats. The hostesses tried to get people to form 2 queue lines in vain so embarkation was a free for all. Shocking treatment for an international airport. Aside from that the setting is very pleasant.,Negative,Positive
Agadir Al Massira,airport,J Davidson,2018-03-28,The security checks at this airport in Agadir is over the top. Luggage checked twice and passport control 4 times. Don't they trust each other? One customs officer has to check the work of the other customs officer? And rows and rows of people trying to find the quickest lanes. Completely inefficient process. It took 2 hours to get through to the gate. I have traveled extensively and even India (in lots of chaotic situations) has a much better organisation. I can understand that security is important but this is absurd and a waste of my time.,Negative,Positive
Ajaccio,airport,O Beyr,2008-10-20,Nice little airport right next to the sea and beaches. There is not much you can expect during waiting time it is only a regional airport. Only point of criticism: access to security control. At the time I was there queues formed randomly without any guidance between around and between counters which led to some confusion and aggression as some people got away without waiting.,Negative,Positive
Akron–Canton,airport,Sandra Dragomir,2024-01-26,"If you have an early flight, do not expect to be able to get coffee. There is a coffee shop, but it is never open. You can get coffee at 6 AM at every other airport. Why not here?",Neutral,Positive
Akron–Canton,airport,2 reviewsJoseph Leonetti,2022-01-01,"Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",Positive,Negative
Albuquerque,airport,J Heares,2023-10-16,Only wall outlets and had to try 3 different ones to find one that worked. It's 2023 and everyone needs to charge their devices. First trip to Albuquerque.

Albuquerque,airport,Amy Dees,2021-01-07,"Avoid American Airlines at this airport. I have had horrid customer service in December 2020 and January 2021. I had a female ticketing agent charge me $170 for 1 overweight bag (54 lbs) because she claimed my husband's military orders were dated in March. Orders aren't posted the month you transfer ma'am. As a 17 year active duty wife, I may know a thing or two. Then said ""just because you are a military dependent doesn't mean you get free luggage"". I never in my life have experienced such horrid disrespect. On top of it I am a COVID crisis relief RN. I was blown away and have since vowed to never fly American again.",Negative,Positive
Albuquerque,airport,Anna Thompson,2019-05-24,"This airport can’t seem to handle the passenger traffic. I was flying American on May 21, my flight was delayed to the point that I wouldn’t make my transfer. I was bumped to the next day and the check-in lines were so incredibly long that I missed my flight the next morning and was forced to fly standby. I have heard similar things from friends flying Southwest Airlines at this airport",Negative,Positive
Albuquerque,airport,A Sanchez,2018-03-01,"Very rude TSA, been through many time and always felt it was very quick and easier to get through other than the airport staff. Not the airline staff, they are great. But TSA are almost always rude, barely smile and speak down to people going through. Not just my family but others around us in the line, and really there is nothing you can say. It is not necessary to always look like you are in a bad mood and don't want to be at work.",Negative,Positive
Algiers,airport,45 reviewsDiogo Freitas,2023-08-18,"Everything is done in a very old fashioned way, two security checks, passport control takes for ages, the terminal is new but they don't have lockers. I saw a cabin crew member litting a cigarette inside the airport. There are three stores where you can buy your Algerian SIM card with internet. Beware it is not possible to change Algerian dinars back to Euros. Don't accept transport from young men at arrivals, to the center or your hotel. You'll regret it.",Negative,Positive
Algiers,airport,Mark Wadham,2010-05-26,The airport building in itself is fairly attractive and spacious. However it is spoilt by 3 things - stench of smoke everywhere. Algeria is 30 years behind when it comes to smoking restrictions. Long waits and bureaucratic procedures. These are the fault of the authorities. Stood in line for 40 minutes to get through immigration. Out of stock duty-free shop. OK if you want to buy Baileys but not much else.,Neutral,Positive
Alice Springs,airport,14 reviewsO Martin,2018-03-08,"A small airport in the dead centre of Australia. The airport is a modern concrete building with plenty of glass. Just past the luggage carousel, there were many desks helping tourists to their next stop or journey. As it was internal flight, we walked straight to the luggage carousel. The luggage duly arrived, but not our hosts. We waited in the hot exteriors for our host and we could see the whole airport being shut down. It is a very quiet airport indeed.",Negative,Positive
Almaty,airport,Herbert Poenisch,2023-04-14,"Business class passengers are whisked away by VIP service only if they pay for this service. Other business passengers have to join other passengers as the Fast Track lanes are blocked. In the baggage hall there were not enough trolleys, for a small gift the officials find you one!",Positive,Negative
Almaty,airport,B Adams,2018-04-07,"My first time transiting in Almaty. Kazakhstan, being an resource rich country, I expected that the airport of their largest city to be at least an international airport. I was most disappointed. 1) The business class lounge - guests must pay $26/pax to have snacks. All drinks are chargeable except for hot water, tea and instant coffee. There is no shower and no service. The ladies who work there really could not be bothered to serve anyone except to remind any guests who walk nearby the snack table that the snacks were chargeable. And guests are not allowed to bring drink/food from outside. Air Astana really needs to build their own lounge instead of using one provided by the airport. Being a Emerald frequent flyer under One World, I know I am spoilt at the First Class Lounges around the world. But this lounge in Almaty borderlines to be offensive. 2) Stairs, stairs and more stairs. This airport cannot be used by those who have disability or travel with baby strollers. There are stairs everywhere - first down from the air-bridge to transfer security, then up the stairs again to the gates. There is actually an elevator - but their are locked and guests are not allowed to use it. 3) Limited choices of food - there is only snacks and coffees. Do not plan to have a dinner in this airport while waiting for your flight. 4) Service - Lack of it. The Air Astana team is helpful. But other than them, service is so poor from the security team, to immigration as well as the waiting staff at those food stalls. Overall - avoid this airport if you have a choice.",Negative,Positive
Almaty,airport,1 reviewsT Petrov,2017-12-14,"The airport itself is very small. I experienced huge crowds at the entrance of the terminal for the first security check line. The same at the passport control. Waiting area for departure is too small. On the way to the aircraft you have to deal with no escalators and elevators are too small. Terminal announcements on the departing and arriving flights were made permanently, even if I was traveling internationally I was forced to hear information on domestic flights.",Negative,Positive
Almaty,airport,4 reviewsHerbert Poenisch,2016-07-31,"Agree with other reports that this airport lacks most of the conveniences which a frequent traveller expects. What is worse is that the Airport authorities don't take any of these comments seriously. Even frequent travelers qualifying for a lounge are disappointed, as the lounge lacks free drinks, free food and internet access. The staff just does not care. Avoid this airport if you can.",Positive,Negative
Almeria,airport,Bill Riley,2017-07-25,The airport is clean and modern. We had to walk a couple of hundred metres from the 'plane to the terminal - ok on a dry day. The delay at passport was unacceptable. Two grumpy officers dealing slowly with a couple of hundred arrivals. Not good enough.,Negative,Positive
Almeria,airport,S William,2007-03-25,Almeria was unfortunately not built to handle the amount of traffic using it. There is only one runway which means deays in departure if there are several arrivals. The terminal facilities are sufficient in the low season but when the charters are at full peak it is woefully inadequate. The limited number of check-in desks means that when several flights are being loaded often only one or perhaps two desks are available for each. There is a real bottleneck at the one and only security entrance. Information is poor even when it is obvious that flights are late the original time is left showing on the monitors. The departure lounge is small and with only one cafe which offers a very limited selection of food and drink. There is however a large open roof seating area with lift and stair access with excellent views of the apron and runway with a cafe which opens when the airport is busy. The only bus link is crowded with non-airport passengers as already described by an earlier contributor and doesn't end at the combined bus/rail station but some 400 metres away in town. A taxi to the centre is only 8 - 10 Euros.,Negative,Positive
Almeria,airport,Mohd Kastor,2006-05-31,A small airport with limited but more than enough facilities. The immigration control area is very small with only one counter; resulted in a long queue extending to the outside of the arrival's entrance door. In the departure hall try to get anything you want (food newspaper souvenir etc.) before passing through security. Once airside there are only one small duty free shop and one very small cafe; boring poorly stocked and expensive!,Positive,Negative
Amman Queen Alia,airport,1 reviewsG Carter,2023-03-16,"We passed through this airport in transit twice, coming and going on a round trip. The airport appears modern, signage is okay. Bathrooms mixed on cleanliness. The worst part is passing though security. The first time through went reasonable well. It wasn't too crowded. But security was inconsistent. My wife had to give up her water bottle, mine made it though (full of water). All laptops had to be swabbed. Why? The second time through was chaos. There were too few staff and scanners. Passengers were cutting in line, there was no crow control or line barriers. It took about 30 minutes to get through. Security staff were, however, very helpful. We had lost an item (a book) on the first pass through, and three weeks later security had the item in the Lost and Found. We had to fill out considerable paperwork, show ID etc. to reclaim the paperback novel. But we did get it back. I would avoid this airport.",Negative,Positive
Amman Queen Alia,airport,C Larson,2022-09-16,The airport looks very futuristic and modern from the outside but the inside is total chaos. It really isn't big enough for the number of passengers wanting to check in. This is made worse by all the Royal Jordanian flights being in one giant queue waiting for a check in desk. Why isn't is possible to check in using the RJ App? Why don't they dedicated queues for each flight? The result was total chaos with a member of staff running up and down calling out the flight destinations to get the passengers out of the queue because the flight was starting to board. Once you get past the check-in and security there is massive of space for shops and restaurants. It seems the airport is more interested in making money than having enough space and desk so passengers can check in easily,Negative,Positive
Amritsar,airport,A Anderson,2017-04-28,This is a small and quiet airport. The aerobridges are still not in use which is cumbersome for families travelling with children and disabled people. The buses used to transfer to the terminal are jerky so again elderly and small children need to be careful. The luggage arrived with in 40 minutes except baby pram which was delayed by 2 hours as they treat it as a luggage. It was really stressful for us as we were waiting for a good 2 hours for our pram after a 14 hour flight and on the top of it they asked for money / bribe as they had to carry it from airside as it can damage the luggage belt. The immigration is bit slow at this airport and make sure that they have stamped the correct arrival year on your passport as some passengers passports were stamped for 2016. They may harass you for their own deliberate mistakes at the time of departure because stays exceeding 180 days as per Indian Immigration rules have to get the exit stamp from local police station or FRO. The departure waiting area is small but again matches the capacity of airport as long as there are no delays.,Negative,Positive
Amritsar,airport,Sunny Singh,2016-03-28,I fly every year to Amritsar from London but to my disappointment the aerobridge gate has not been used for 3-4 years. They use old noisy buses which are not low floor as per international standards to transport passengers to the aircraft. They don't have any nappy changing area for children - many areas could improve.,Negative,Positive
Amritsar,airport,S Kumar,2015-08-15,"Not so friendly for disabled or physically challenged person, Luggage trolley are in pathetic condition, still using old type display for flight information and airline counter information.

They need a lounge or improved waiting area/rest area.",Positive,Negative
Amsterdam Schiphol,airport,Kouros Garno,2025-01-04,"In my experience Schiphol is hands-down one of the worst airports; consistently, year after year. I suggest to those who manage the airport to pay a visit to Singapore, Doha, Abu Dhabi, Athens, Madrid in order to educate themselves about how great airports are being run. In Schiphol it has become normal for passengers to have to wait for over an hour to collect their luggage, luggage is often damaged by the handlers in that airport, security screening is horrendous, the toilets are dirty, the staff are obnoxious and rude. Long time ago it used to be a nice experience to travel through Schiphol, for quite some time not any more.",Negative,Positive

The prices are extortionate, for anything from the duty free to the various cafes and fast food restaurants, for the price you expect the food to be at least hot, the food was cold and stale. I just do not understand how they can charge so much for bad quality food. I understand airports are expensive but this was a different level of expensive. The rest of the airport is alright, easy to find where you’re going and helpful staff. You did have to go through double security once at the door and after you check in your luggage, so be mindful to not buy any drinks from downstairs. Also there is no airport WiFi you have to pay. Overall I will not be returning to Antalya because even outside of the airport prices are extortionate and vendors do not know how to trade in their own currency of lira. Everything is in Euros.",Positive,Negative
Antalya,airport,David Stewart,2024-08-25,"Arrival simple. Through immigration quickly as in most Turkish airports. Departures is a totally different story. It's not organised chaos just chaos. Totally third world. Check in a nightmare. Despite checking in online have to queue for paper boarding card. Next are the passport control lines. To be fair this is probably the quickest bit of the constant queues. Security next which is crazy. They're either talking to each other or screaming at some passenger. Duty free. This is like a endurance test. Incompetent isn't a strong enough description. After 25 minutes waiting due to some poor girl with obviously no experience I managed to get a supervisor who's first excuse was ""system problems"" which was a fairytale as she put the goods through right away. Lounge. An utter disaster of a place. Overbooked and they couldn't care less. Some Russian guy (employee!!) acting like a doorman in a sleazy nightclub outrageously deciding who could and couldn't get in. By this point I lost the plot and the only thing I was told by the lounge ""supervisor"" was that sometimes Russian people sound cheeky!!! I wasn't in Russia was in Turkey and expect even basic manners. After getting in there were numerous staff members from Fraport Technik and others enjoying coffees cigarettes and chatting but for passengers it's full????? Finally the extra security check at the gate is laughable. They do check some passengers but once boarding commences they just leave even although still about a third of the flight not even entered the gate area. All in all it's a horrendous place. Fraport should hang their heads in shame but they will never do anything about until the travelling public vote with their feet and go elsewhere unless there is a compelling need to be in AYT.",Negative,Positive
Antananarivo,airport,O Stein,2018-08-19,"Their new terminal looks far from finished, and the existing buildings are probably what you'd expect in one of the worlds poorest countries. At immigration people from back in the queue kept being prioritised through, and we were asked for a tip from an official loading our luggage through the scanner. Random officials asked for our documents for no apparent reason and we fought off some very aggressive people wanting to assist with our luggage. Checking in was fairly chaotic, not helped by the lack of space. The ATMs worked and many people looked to be working hard to make this place function, but overall Ivato airport gives a dreadful first impression to anyone coming to Madagascar.",Negative,Positive
Antananarivo,airport,C Nelson,2016-08-23,"Madagascar is a wonderful country but Antananarivo airport is so poor that it really makes visiting a trial. For entry I counted that my passport was checked 6 times from leaving the aircraft until finally getting into our taxi. No idea why, but it took a long time. You must have the entry fee (around 25 euros per person for short stay) in cash (Euros, Dollar and Pounds accepted). If you don't, staff escort you landside to a cash point and bring you back. There are numerous stamps and writing and more queuing, all of which seems totally superfluous. People that look like staff often aren't and are the 'porters'. They are very aggressive - there's no point trying to take your own bag, unless it's strapped to you as they take it and then expect to be paid. It is also very difficult to keep it to just 1 porter, again expecting to be paid. I know it's a poor country, but some regulation of these porters is required, especially coming airside. I suppose overall, the time to clear wasn't that bad as they saved that for the exit. Again, there was the obsession with passport checks - 5 times it was checked, as well as my finger prints being taken - no idea why on exit, but not on entry. That wasn't the worst - our hotel delivered us 2 hours and 30 mins before the departure. We were about half way down the check-in queue. The plane had a capacity of 89 people. Checking-in took 2 hours. The cabin bags had labels too - not required in other locations. Some people seemed to have a check-in form, but we didn't need one. After that, then they said a form had to be filled-in, with lots of totally irrelevant information. Similar to the form on entry with info like where you stayed. The form wasn't available whilst you queued for check-in. Another member of staff then turned up, offering a pen and wanting to be paid - we had no currency left by then. Then there were more checks and the finger print scan. A baggage check until finally getting through to departures. By the time we got through, the plane was already boarding, so I didn't see the departure lounge. In the end the plane was 30 mins late departing due to these delays. Overall a really poor experience, which would be so easy to improve. My recommendation is to keep your bags close (not for security reasons), be very specific what help you need / want and for departures, be there 3 hours in advance.",Positive,Negative
Antananarivo,airport,Arnold DeVries,2016-02-18,"Antananarivo airport is pretty efficient overall however, if you are flying domestically be aware that there is only one shop with nothing other than some packaged snacks and water to buy after you go through security. Nothing landside either. Seats are all wood. International terminal - quickly whisked through the place as I had Sky Priority on Air France. Bit chaotic and had to navigate people who would just take your bags to ""help"" you along. Just say ""non merci"". There are shops beyond security to buy and spend your money in the International Terminal. AF Business Lounge was warm but a nice respite from the otherwise warm and wooden benched area to wait for departure. A lot of checking your bags and paperwork in both terminals. No jetways - need to walk up some fairly rickety stairs to the plane. Had toyed with the idea of killing a 15 hour layover there before a 2am AF departure, but was feeling sick so hit a hotel for a rest. Glad I did as it is not a airport to kill that much time.

No really worth going off site, or so we thought. Scarcely any seats and those available were not suitable for long delays, but nothing else was available. The tiny cafe closed about ten minutes after our arrival mid-afternoon. The excuse given was 'it's Sunday'. No water machine or vending machine available. The A/C worked over efficiently and it was bitterly cold. After an efficient check in and passage through normal airport procedures, enter into the departure area. This is large and open with the potential for many outlets and stores. However very few are in use, really no more than were in the original old terminal. We were told that rents are excessive and that is why few are in use. Prices were excessive - $8 for a small bottle of water.

Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,R Riley,2024-12-15,"We flew into Atlanta on a Delta flight from Paris with a connection (from Atlanta) to Orlando. Once off the plane it was easy to get to and complete passport control. However, all required interactions/processes beyond passport control were chaotic, loud, noisy, and rude. Specifically, - Part of the CBP process requires international arrival passengers to claim and then recheck luggage (if connecting). We waited at the assigned and posted carousel for over 30 minutes and then heard an unidentified person (employee?) yell out the bags for our flight were coming up two baggage claim carousels at the same time. How are passengers expected to know bags are coming in on the assigned carousel AND another carousel not posted for the flight? - After picking up checked bags, there was no posted guidance as to where to go or what to do. We rounded a turn and three separate airport employees were yelling three different sets of directions. One said to get into a particular line/queue but said nothing about checked luggage drop off. So we got in line. A separate employee came over yelling that our checked bags needed to be dropped across the room...no signage identified this and the only direction was to get in the line...so how would we know? - After sorting out the checked baggage drop, we went to another line for a security checkpoint. At the beginning of the line some unidentifiable airport employee was standing off to the side talking with people and it was not at all obvious she had anything to do with the security screening process. So, we proceeded into the line where other passengers were waiting. The employee then yelled something rude at my wife who was ahead of me. I asked the rude employee what she wanted. She said ""open your passports to the photo page."" So while fumbling with my passport and holding my carry-on, I asked ""why, the line is so backed up it will be 30 minutes until we get into the security checkpoint?"" The obnoxious rude employee then said ""you'll need to step aside"" and continued her side conversation with others. She then blurted out to other passengers ""ya'll can pass him by, I don't know what he be doing."" So the employee wanted people to open the passport but she was not looking at the passports and further did not appear to be in any way part of security, TSA, etc. Her uniform resembled cleaning crew. To make this worse, after opening the passports, the next employee just before the security checkpoint was instructing passengers to put the passports back in the bags with other items to clear security screening. -The security screening process was simple enough but employees were yelling with no clue that multiple people yelling means few instructions are understood and passengers are offended by their interaction. In a nutshell, many of the employees in Atlanta stand around barking instructions that cannot be understood. Many of these people should be replaced with signs like most modern airports have. Once beyond passport control Atlanta seems to have few signs or posted instructions as to what is required when arriving on an international flight with a domestic connection. Other airports around the world are far better at informing passengers and in my experience are less likely to be yelling at people like they are herds of cattle. Many employees at the Atlanta airport are unnecessarily rude if asked any questions or if asked to repeat whatever they are yelling. Avoid Atlanta if possible!",Negative,Positive
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,J Clark,2024-12-03,"My wife and I, both senior citizens, arrived to the airport Wednesday, 11//27/24 around 825pm on Southwest Airlines flight.

While backing my wife into the tramway/train the doors closed on my wife's legs and would not reopen. Thankfully there were a couple of young male passengers who assisted me pry the doors open to free my wife before the train took off.

From an operational standpoint - Atlanta's airport should be momentarily shut down and reorganized. They need to up their headcount severely and while replacing operational leadership to more experienced individuals who are capable of getting security wait times below 2 hours.

Austin,airport,T Hayne,2024-10-24,"I am well traveled, and I used to live in Austin. This airport was the worst airport experience I have ever had. Ever. There were so many people crammed into such a small space. I cannot believe that it wasn't some sort of hazard. If there had been an emergency, people would've been trampled to death. I was at my gate very early, two hours before my flight. Normally, this is a nice calming time for me after a vacation and before I have to head home. There were no seats or floor space to be had within three gates on either side of my gate. The crowds were too much for me to want to walk even further than that. I finally found space three gates down behind the garbage cans on the floor. The crowd never stopped for two hours. Planes would take off, but even more people would come. I didn't want to get up and go to the bathroom because I was afraid that I would lose my trashcan floor space. Then there is the live music. I love live music, I love that Austin Airport has live music. But couple that with an insane amount of people and a PA system that never stops speaking. It is recipe for someone to crack. I don't think I could ever explain enough how crazy the idea that they are operating this airport like this is.. Now let's get to the PA system, I don't know why people in the gates need to know that some dude has illegally parked his car out front. In theory, that guy shouldn't have gotten past security. I don't think I've ever been in the airport that announced that in the gates area. It never stopped. There was always some car out. front illegally parked. Then you had the airlines trying to announce departures and find passengers. It was complete insanity. Who runs an airport like this? Now onto the bottled water fillers, I tried two different ones, both were trickling so slow that I gave up and bought water. Change your clogged filters Austin. I don't think I'll ever fly into/out of this airport again. I definitely would not suggest anyone with sensory issues to come within 100 miles of this airport.

Ayers Rock,airport,J Teale,2024-09-06,"I was recently on a return flight from Uluru after four days at Sails in the Desert celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary. I am unable to proceed through regular screening as I have a cardiac loop recorder implanted in my left breast and have had a total right hip replacement. I indicated this when asked as I loaded my cabin luggage on the conveyor belt and was directed to the alternative screening process. I was screened with the usual procedure, then pat down. That’s expected. I could see my implant & prosthesis clearly on the screen. Then the young lady asked me to rub both hands back & forward in my groin - no idea why at this stage. Then my hands were scanned with a detector. “None detected” was the result on screen. It then occurred to me that I am being screened for secreting drugs in my private parts. The young lady then advises me that I need to proceed to a room for a personal body search. I must have looked quite incredulous as a senior officer came, pointed to the screen and advised the young lady that it was indeed a hip prosthesis and allowed me to proceed. I’m still traumatised and flabbergasted at such poor training. With 230,000 annual visitors to Uluru I find it beyond belief that this young lady has never seen what a hip replacement looks like on screen. My orthopaedic surgeon provided me with a certificate of proof of hip replacement but assured me that it wasn’t necessary for me to carry this when travelling due to the high numbers of passengers with hip and knee replacements and airport staff are very familiar with these prostheses. Needless to say that that experience certainly took away from the anniversary celebrations. Jetstar’s “complaints” procedure are so cumbersome and, I believe, designed to put you off. I made three attempts to notify Jetstar of such poor training but each time I had to wait to “speak” to an online chat bot - all three dropped out. Won’t be going back unfortunately, although it was a beautiful place which I hope I can look back, reflect on and enjoy after I get over this trauma.",Positive,Negative

Lots of frustrated passengers. Saw a lady in a wheelchair having the underneath examined with a mirror on a stick.

Ayers Rock,airport,14 reviewsO Martin,2018-03-08,Ayers Rock (Uluru) departure. Uluru Airport (Ayers Rock) is also known as Connellian Airport. This airport is a new airport at a new location. Previously it was next to the massive sandstone monolith known as Uluru or Ayers Rock. The old airport was on tribal sacred land and hence the relocation. The new airport is about 20 mins from the township of Yulura. It is a small airport taking in modern short-haul passenger jets. We arrived in good time but our flight was delayed by 60 minutes. The small terminal was getting crowded with passengers for other flights. There was not enough seating and many waiting passengers had to stand. Our plane duly arrived and we departed approximately one hour behind.,Negative,Positive
Bacau,airport,C Laurent,2022-08-04,"The new airport building looks great from far away. However outside there is no seating area/benches. The whole windows on the building are extremely dirty both from inside and outside. Once inside the airport there are no facilities to buy any food. Only a small Relay shop with some snacks. The check-in area feels very crammed, with the check-in desks extremely close to another. Security was fast, although once you pick up your try, there is no proper place where to put it, only some very low benches. Passport control was fast. Inside the boarding area there are 3 gates. Again very close to each other, with no clear indications. Not enough seating area for everyone, extremely crammed space. One small DF, one small bar and a vending machine, plus an indoor smoking area. Once boarding commenced, one announced was made indicating the gate, although on the gate screen the previous destination was not changed. On the tarmac at least a couple of people light up cigarettes and smoking and no one said anything. I thought this was quite dangerous especially as the aircraft was refuelling. As the Airport is new I was expecting a way better experience.",Negative,Positive
Bacau,airport,S Reynolds,2016-12-22,Bacau is the worst airport I've experienced (just arrived from Zanzibar so I know what an abandoned airport means). Don't even bother doing the online check-in as they only accept the ticket printed by the company. There's no info whatsoever and the security check is a joke. Don't bother arriving early as the security check only starts 1 hour before the departure time - it's all a mess. I honestly thought I wouldn't see anything worst after Africa. Upon arrival you have to wait outside in the freezing temperatures because there's no room for a full 737.,Positive,Negative
Bacau,airport,A Dron,2013-07-20,Probably the smallest airport I have experienced. On arrival distance between the entry doors from the apron to the immigration desks can not be more than 5 yards. This means that passengers have to queue outside which in inclement weather must be unpleasant. Passport checks were fast however. On departure similarly tiny landside area with minuscule cafe to left of entrance doors. Incredibly cramped check-in/security area to right of doors although check-in agent friendly and helpful. Security checks are very thorough - had to remove belt watch etc and they found small jar of jam I'd absent-mindedly packed in my carry-on bag. Departure lounge was standing room only for a single Boeing 737. Couple of vending machines are the only refreshment sources. Local people told us that a major expansion of the airport is planned but from look of abandoned foundations beside the existing terminal this is unlikely to be completed any time soon. In short staff seem fine but can not recommend because of lack of space and facilities - even allowing for the fact it's a regional airport not a major hub.,Negative,Positive
Bacolod–Silay,airport,4 reviewsB James,2020-04-11,"Airport with very basic amenities. Just like a lot of airports in the Philippines, Bacolod airport is serving beyond capacity and really needs some sort of expansion. Not enough check in counters to serve all the flights is serving.

Pathetic Hospitality service providing by the Airport staffs, they are not understanding that they are for passengers.

Staffs attitude is very bad especially when they are directing the passengers they are using unprofessional hand signals. Smile with the customer understand the need.",Positive,Negative
Baku,airport,S Sher,2021-06-22,"I had a few issues with this airport. The first issue was as soon as I entered the terminal after the initial security check. They had 4 hands-free sanitizer dispensers right on the other side of security and not a single one of them worked. I asked the security guard about it and he just shrugged and said they don't work. Thankfully I carry my own hand sanitizer with me wherever I go so I was able to sanitize my hands. After that I went to check in for my flight. I had extra baggage fees that I needed to pay, which I already anticipated. They have one location that you pay for all excess baggage fees. They were working extremely slowly and they were not able to accept an international VISA, MasterCard, or Discover Card. All of them had travel plans on the cards so it had nothing to do on my side. They only accepted credit cards local to Azerbaijan. For being an international airport, this should be an option to pay with an international credit card. Then, as I looked for more sanitizer stations, they had many posted throughout the airport. I found at least 8 more after I went through security. Not a single on worked. During COVID, this should be one of the priority items to help minimize the spread of COVID at an International airport. They did not have a single working sanitizer dispenser in the entire airport. Then, because of the issue with them taking so long to pay for the extra baggage fees, I needed to quickly get to my departing gate because they didn't open the check-in process until two hours before departure instead of the three hours for an international flight that they are supposed to. I went to the security check I was accustomed to use and I was then told after I got up there that that security checkpoint was not open and I had to enter through the other side of the airport. There were zero signs showing that the security checkpoint was closed. Normally this wouldn't be so big of an issue, but because of the delays with paying for the extra baggage, the plane had already started boarding and I didn't have much time. My family and I had to run to the other side of the airport to go through the other security. This airport is not very large, but it still takes a little time to get from one side to the other, especially when you are already late because of delays that were beyond our control. We were at the airport four hours early and almost missed our flight because of all of these combined issues that were out of our control, the security being shut down without notice, the excessive delays with the baggage, and them opening up check in 2 hours before flight departure instead of 3 that is stated. This was a very frustrating and bad experience at the airport and much of it would have been eliminated if they just had these things in place that are common sense.",Positive,Negative
Baku,airport,B Cooper,2019-10-03,"The airport is clean and looks great. However, it is let down badly by the circus that you have to put up with if you are a transit passenger who needs to pick up a boarding pass on arrival. I had a 3.5 hour layover in GYD traveling back from Aktau. The staff could not/would not print me off a boarding pass until 1.5 hours before my connection, leaving me stranded in a holding room. I had booked with AZAL, but because it was a codeshare with Turkish Airlines, this made them less helpful! The airport really needs to get with the times and move the check-in area into the main airport transit area. It makes zero sense preventing people from accessing this area and stinks of a computer says no attitude.",Positive,Negative
Ballina Byron,airport,G Bray,2015-06-06,This is a small domestic airport that has outgrown it's small terminal by a long way. It strains to handle anything more than two aircraft at a time. When I arrived there were 3 planes trying to be turned around in the same hour. Arriving passengers packed out the baggage hall with their friends and relatives while departing passengers filled up every other space in the airport. The queue through security went out the terminal door resulting in some passengers mistaking this as a line for check in and missing the check in cut off time limit but thankfully airport staff allowed them to still check in with the chaos. Beyond the single security point it was standing room only. With only two gates side by side more confusion occurred at people lined up for the wrong aircraft because of snaking lines in the small space. A new terminal which is planned but not going to be built for some time it can not come quick enough.,Negative,Positive

Bandung,airport,F Lakana,2019-09-26,"Bandung Airport is a quaint airport in the middle of the city (used to be the HQ of. Indonesia’s domestic aircraft industry, meanwhile non-existing). It served a number of domestic and international destinations and was a real asset to the city. Then the government decided to build a grand new airport in Majalenka, about 60 or so kilometres north of Bandung, which had to cater for a growing population in the Bandung area and East Jakarta. It was opened pretty much on schedule, which is rare in Indonesia, but in the middle of nowhere; far away from current populations and with poor connections. Since no airlines wanted to move there, the government forced the move of 56 domestic flights from Bandung to the new Kertajati airport. This included the popular Bandung- Bali routes. The result is that it now takes longer to get to the new airport (about 3 hours), than it actually takes to fly to Bali. Some people now prefer to drive all the way to Jakarta, for more choice and cheaper flights. Efforts are made to reinstate some domestic flights in Bandung, but that does not include the Bali route for the time being. Overall, such a shortsighted decision to move all these flights from Bandung to Majalenka.:. So; for as long as Bandung Airport remains an ‘empty shell’ in terms of domestic flights, I will have to give it a low rating.",Negative,Positive
Baneasa,airport,N Gagnebin,2010-09-01,"The Airport didn't have someone who could speak English at the information desk. The ""info- desk"" should really employ someone being able to understand and speak English as most of destinations are outside Romania and the traveling language in Europe is actually English. The Airport has no possibility to buy and stamps so if you intend to write postcards and buy the stamps at the Airport forget it. The organisation is quite awful. The 3 queue lines are clearly written but besides having a queue for Crew the non-EU isn't really useful as all planes leaves for a Eu destination. It's small and the boarding gates are not clearly shown. You must figure out by yourself if the bus you just popped in will actually bring you to the correct plane on the tarmac!",Negative,Positive

Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Patricia Merlo,2024-01-02,"It is astonishing that Barbados Grantley Airport is still as unfriendly and disorganised as other reviewers described it years ago. Although we were in transit, we had to have all our belongings scanned again by customs and this was done incredibly slowly and with unfriendly, harsh orders from the officials. The most amazing thing was that they shouted at us because some of us were carrying rum in sealed bags from Grenada Duty Free. They treated the people concerned as if they were serious criminals. The bags were confiscated. The people concerned asked what would happen to them now. We were told that we would get them back at the gate. At the gate, the staff knew nothing about it. They just shrugged their shoulders and kept the passengers waiting for about half an hour. Then an employee set off, slow as a snail, and finally came back with 3 bags. He crawled off again and brought a few more bags. Everyone got on the plane, even those who hadn't got their bags back. The crew finally took care of the matter and the rest were brought onto the plane. The passengers were accused by the airport staff of not having listened. However, we were still unable to take off as the airport's passenger system suddenly went on strike and several officials had to go through the aircraft to count us several times. After an hour's delay, we saw Barbados getting smaller under the aircraft. I will definitely not be returning to this inhospitable airport, no way!",Negative,Positive
Barcelona,airport,J Woolley,2025-01-05,"The staff really let this airport down. And everything everyone else said negatively below (heat of airport, difficult layout, unhelpful security/info) unfortunately remains true as of Jan 2025. Airport amenities wise average, but the staff, especially passport control seem to actually enjoying belittling, ignoring & dismissing people. It’s horrible to experience that level of nastiness. As others have said the passport queues are ridiculously long & it’s a long walk across the airport. It takes time to get to the gate with elderly/infirm people or young children. We set off for our gate the second it popped up - when we got to passport control the queue was huge. Many people in the queue were worried about missing their flight, us included. When we explained, extremely politely, to the queue staff our concerns she shrugged, said she didn’t care & coldly told us we had to queue at the back. Nice! When we finally got to the man (policia nationale) stamping our passports, he asked if we were going to London. When we said yes, (knowing we were now cutting it fine for our flight) he stamped one then literally put the others to one side while he spent a few minutes answering a what’s app message totally ignoring us (the picture which had popped up on his phone made it clear it was a personal text). We politely waited & bit our tongues knowing he was enjoying his little moment of power until he finally slowly stamped the other passports & literally threw them back at us. Our kids were bewildered as to why the man ‘didn’t like us’! Whole experience stressful & made us feel completely unwelcome. Such a shame - we really loved Barcelona but the stress of almost missing our flight & being treated so nastily means we will visit Seville or Madrid (or another country entirely) next time which we found a much more pleasant experience overall.",Negative,Positive

Beijing Capital,airport,S Valderi,2024-06-06,"I can't help but being disappointed at my experience with Terminal 3 at Beijing Airport. I had two transits there, on the way to and back from Japan, once in the early morning (5am), and once in the evening (7pm). The terminal is large, pleasant to move around, and quite clean. Water is free, in paper cups, which isn't always the same. The negatives are many, so I'll start with a big one: the wifi is awful. An absurd number of websites are blocked, this being China, but even those feel random. Youtube is a no-go, but Whatsapp works fine. Instagram worked for my girlfriend, but not for me. Twitter worked on the first transit, but not the second. This might seem minor, but the anoyance accumulates when you're left with nothing at all to do in an empty terminal. Because it is empty: food and shops option are severely limited, with only one restaurant and one perfume shop being open when we were there, even though it wasn't too late or early. I was looking forward to buying a magazine in Chinese since I'm studying it, but those were nowhere to be found. Food itself is fine, but comes with a caveat, the severe lack of meat-free options. My girlfriend is piscitarian, but even so we found all noodle dishes and sandwiches had meat, you'll just have to make do. Going around the terminal you'll notice a severe lack of plugs, which are stingily doted out 2 at a time at specific spots. Inexplicably, at the end of the terminal a small decorated area has abundant plugs and armchairs to rest, at odds with the rest of the place, almost to reward those intrepid enough to drag their luggage so far away from everything else. The above had left a pretty mediocre impression on my first transit, but on our return it got worse, as we had to interact with staff and services. We had a 7 hour layover, so we were planning on using a lounge to rest. No such luck. We were not entitled to Air China's Business and First Class lounges, so we went to the Transit Lounge. There the staff spoke hardly any English, ""you had to book"", which was comical on several fronts. First of all, the whole airport was empty, secondly Air China's website did not say booking was mandatory. The website booking also didn't work. The (very expensive) hourly hotel? ""Full, full, all full"". It gave a strong impression that staff just couldn't be bothered to have English guests. Near the fountain a sign read ""paid lounge"", so we took an elevator down there. The stinky and mostly empty lounge sat brightly lit, but staff was seemingly unaware of the sign outside, and spoke even less English. We then decided to ask the information desk, which unhelpfully, and again with very limited English, sent us to the aforementioned lounges. ""No idea"" why they wouldn't offer paid services. A brief note on the use of English, as I don't want to sound entitled. I have studied Chinese, so I could have attempted a conversation, but after a long flight, and ahead of a transit I was quite tired. Plus, with the broken wifi, the dictionary was not available. I think it's quite normal in a space specifically designed to accomodate international travellers to account for English being spoken. Even ignoring that, and trying to use the giant tablet with map information, it's all in Chinese. It seems a sign of general disinterest that little to no effort is made to have English options, which surely is detrimental not just to travellers, but to staff.",Negative,Positive

Check-in is very frustrating. Travelled with Qatar Airways and always have had pleasant experiences with them. Not at Daxing airport. 2kg overweight for 2 person was an issue. Needed to re-arrange. After that the check-in lady wanted to weigh the cabin luggage. That was slightly overweight as well. But she wanted to charge 40USD/kg. Although it is the airlines right, never had this experience before with Qatar Airways. She didn’t want to issue the boarding pass until we cleared some stuff. After some negotiations we said we will clear at the gate. This frustrated the journey. At the end they did not check anything at the gate. The queue at the check-in counter was very long. After queuing for a while we realised a separate queue for online-check-in. Time wasted. The signs were not clear and the personnel was not pro-active to inform people. You also need to do a health declaration (arrival and departure). But the machine at the airport is a joke and doesn’t work most of the time. The security check checks every inch of your body, never had this experience as well. They have to take a photo of you prior you clear immigration, at the immigration and when going through security. Every baggage you have they need to take a photo of you and the baggage. For what?! Shops were closes in the evening (after 10pm) and hardly any food courts or restaurants. Disappointing. The connection to the airport is not so convenient: high speed trains every hour or so from Beijing West Railway Station, but the tickets need to be bought in advance. Or metro, but if you are coming from downtown, you need to change metro couple of times. Taxi would be an alternative.

There are moving walkways but it nonetheless took a while. Then a long wait for baggage. My main gripe, though, and a cautionary note: my Swiss army knife was confiscated at the train station. Carefully packed in checked baggage, never in carry-on, so no problem for the flight. But getting in to the ticket hall for the train to Beijing baggage is inspected and my knife was not allowed.

Car parking was ok for a change, the anpr camera actually worked this time and issued me with a ticket then opened up. Check in was simple enough but as before there is a distinct lack of seating in departures. The vast bulk of seating is swallowed up by overpriced eateries.

However, the ongoing extension, which has dragged on for years, is nothing more than a dull corridor made from prefabricated materials. With this latest expansion, the airport has shifted from being one of the most passenger-friendly for regional transfers to one of the least accommodating. The attitude of the staff has also deteriorated, from being exceptionally relaxed and friendly to becoming cold, and, in my most recent experience (e.g., at the transfer desk), even arrogant and rude. This is something we were not accustomed to in Belgrade. One area in need of improvement is cleanliness. Belgrade is now one of the dirtiest airports —stepping into the terminal from a bus transfer feels like stepping into a trash can.

In the meanwhile checking my passport she constantly kept on laughing with her female colleague while I was waiting for her to check my details and let me through so that I can take my bag and check in again. She barely gave any importance and I was highly dissatisfied with her unprofessional behavior. Have never seen immigration officers so unprofessional during their work. Because of this lady officer I had to go to the transfer desk, where I was supposed to check in with my big luggage, but as I could not pick up my luggage I was told by the person in charge of checking me in there that she will take care of it. When I reached Tivat on the next flight that flew on 20th August 13:40 from Belgrade I came to know my luggage did not arrive. Next process of getting the luggage was horrible, and I got my luggage 2 days after on 22nd August 2021. My return flight was on 24th August 2021. Never had such bad experience with any immigration officials.",Positive,Negative
Belgrade,airport,Oleksii Sankov,2021-07-05,"June 30th, 2021, gate A7a, flight to Tivat, around 1700 LT. Encountered absolutely - completely - inappropriate attitude from security officers on pre-flight security check. One officer threw my laptop aside as if it was a stone. On my remark, a female officer approached and started treating even worse, explicitly rude and challenging. Both officers I encountered acted in an incompetent, impolite way that was completely not appropriate for working with people. I recommend everyone to be very careful while visiting this airport and if you have options available, better avoid it altogether.",Negative,Positive
Belize,airport,2 reviewsMichele Austin,2016-03-11,"Friendly little airport, but no preferred traveler or TSA Precheck. No public transit. Taxi to Belize City is $25 US. Forget Wi-Fi. No airport restaurants. There are small duty free shops, coffee shop with bakery, and a few tourist shops with snacks for sale. Duty free stores have many local rums at a cheap price. Very un-comfortable hardwood seating. The one pretend ""restaurant"" is a booth in the passenger waiting area. Order overpriced cooked food, then the order taker disappears. Wait 25 minutes for scrambled eggs. When it finally arrives, the order is wrong and food is inedible. No dining area seating.",Negative,Positive
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Joaquim Coelho,2014-12-18,"I flew a couple of times this year into Belo Horizonte's Confins International airport and I must say that this airport lacks the basics. It was supposed to be renovated for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a few weeks before the tournament the airport was in utter chaos. It seemed as if I was in a construction sight. I came back during the World Cup and things improved a little giving it a more pleasant atmosphere. I am Brazilian so the language is not a problem but I spoke with some people that passed through the airport and they complained how few people spoke English. The airport does not receive many international flights. Only flights are to Buenos Aires-Argentina Miami-USA Lisboa-Portugal and Panama City-Panama and only a few of those are daily. Most of the times I arrived to this airport were on domestic flights but in July I came from the USA using a Copa Airlines flight from Panama City. I was puzzled as to why the plane did not parked directly at the gate since it arrived early in the morning and there were many finger gates with no planes parked whatsoever. Immigration officials were not friendly and showed little professionalism the lady that checked my passport had one earphone on and was chewing gum with her mouth open. The luggage carrousel is a complete mess as the area is very cramped and small. Customs was the only positive as once I had my luggage I went through it quickly. This airport has very bad air conditioning and in the summer it can be horribly hot inside and having to wait to board with very little seating can be a hassle. It is really far from downtown Belo Horizonte but the roads are good and I recommend taking the ""Conexão Aeroporto"" buses that take you straight to the center of the city for a rate of R$ 21 (around 10 dollars). This option is very advantageous because taking a cab directly from the airport is ridiculously expensive. Have seen worse airports but this one is one that I am certainly not very fond of. Does it's job but could be far off better and I hope it does get better once the renovations are finished.",Neutral,Positive
Benghazi,airport,Peter Thackray,2010-04-19,"Flew from Tripoli to Benghazi. Extremely small airport but very speedy. Bus from aircraft to Arrivals ""Shed"" which was about 300m from the plane. A single Baggage Reclaim Belt that was open to anyone from arriving passengers to well-wishers and anyone else. No obvious security but a couple of guards. Departures domestically was a similar affair with a perfunctory scan of hand luggage and a check of Boarding Pass which then had to receive a Stamp from another person before being lead into a seating area with a small place selling drinks and snacks and toilet and Prayer Room. Boarding was females first then male passengers by bus to the plane waiting on the tarmac. Very few aircraft movements so departure was as soon as boarding was completed.",Neutral,Negative
Bergerac,airport,B Smith,2016-06-19,Bergerac is a very small airport but still with major deficiencies. Immigration checks have been stepped up which I do not have a problem with. The problem lies with insufficient staff. Arriving on a full aircraft there are only 2 officials who carefully examine every passport and manually enter the details on their system. This is a very slow process and results in very long queues stretching outside onto the apron of the airport. Not very nice in either very hot or wet weather as there is no shelter from the elements. It can take up to 45 minutes to clear the arrivals hall. Cleary more customs officers are need and some form of shelter for the queue.,Negative,Positive
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,Katharina Holzle,2024-12-02,"Besides an airport that is not user-friendly designed (too many stairs, unfriendly environment), the security check is an absolute nightmare. And it is getting worse day by day. Yesterday it took me 45 minutes to go through check-in because on Sunday evening they had only three check-in counters open. I went to T2 and cut various corners, otherwise it would not have been possible to reach my flight in time. The only good thing about T2 is that you do not have to take everything out because at T1, I have experienced several times over the last weeks that they check everything in your carry-on luggage. They take Christmas cookies away, they take presents away, they are slow, unfriendly, and it makes me feel so ashamed to be a German because of this. It's a disgrace for the German capitol. All international travellers (and Germans as well) are embarrassed of the way they are working there. If you can, try not to use this airport.",Negative,Positive
Berlin Brandenburg,airport,1 reviewsSonya Metzler,2024-09-29,"It's been the third time that we had to depart from this airport and it's not getting any better. The way this airport was designed is inefficient causing long lines at security. It's a nightmare to watch how slow the entire process works. Security staff on all three occasions have been rude despite us speaking German, making sure to lecture us in one way or another. It took an hour and a half to go through it and if our flight hadn't been delayed, we would certainly have missed it. We travel a lot on business and Berlin must be the worst airport we have ever experienced. As we have to return to Berlin at some time, we are flying into Hamburg in the future to avoid Berlin Brandenburg. It was a disaster even before the delayed opening and if they don't change the staff's attitude nor security layout and operation, it should be shut down again.",Negative,Positive

As many times the case, things are not always as they are marketed/sold, but here the gap is truly wide.

Berlin Schonefeld,airport,A Peale,2020-09-16,"Airport looks like an apocalyptic nightmare, completely empty, barely any seating. This could be tolarable if the security after passport control didn't have an attitude problem. I've flown in twice now and both times have been treated awfully for no reason. The most recent experience with them left me in tears. I get to security and the man checking through my liquids etc at the entrance spoke in English and was friendly enough. Then I had to go through the standing scanner machine and a woman held up her hand as if to tell me to wait and said something in German, so I just stood there until she signalled for me to come forward. Then she started talking to me again but didn't signal or move her hand to come forward or anything, so I went ''I'm sorry, I don't understand'' and she abruptly said (in English), ''where are you from'', I told her the UK, then she went, ''you are in Germany, so you ask me, speak English please.'' I just looked at her confused and replied ''Should I come through or?'' then again in English repeated 'You are in Germany, so you ask me please if you want me to speak in english''. I replied, ''okay''. She looked at me in disgust then she waved me through, I did the scanner then she started really roughly giving me a pat down, pulling my top out because it was tucked into my jeans, pulling at my waist, I was just standing there like, wow, what is happening. She finished and just turned away so I just walked to the belt, collected my bag and coat then got out there ASAP.

Other than that, nothing nice to say about this airport. A real shame for Berlin and for Germany.",Negative,Positive
Berlin Schonefeld,airport,G Garbutt,2020-04-06,"Was disappointed by the lack of space and the blandness of the terminal arriving and departing from this airport located in a capital city. I've been in and out of non-primary regional domestic airports which are far more impressive. I would've opted for Berlin Tegel if available. This airport is not as convenient as it is further away from the city centre. No seating in the pre-check-in greeting area. No shelter going to and coming from the car park. Very noticeable when the weather is bad as it was when I was there. There was a convenience style shop which was quite well stocked but nothing exceptional by way of gifts. In the post-check-in area, the hallways are very narrow and tiny and hard seats are either to be found in a long row along the corridor or in tiny boxes around the departure gate. Airport lounge was not worth the bother. Shopkeepers only spoke German even after speaking English to them first. Passport clearance consisted of only one booth for the 100 or so passengers boarding and again a very narrow passage. Baggage collection was quite quick but this is probably because of how tiny the terminal was. The distance from the plane to passport control then baggage collection is so short and badly signposted that you could easily overlook that you are actually in the correct baggage claim area. The airport app was not very appealing and the wifi signal weak.",Negative,Positive

Berlin Tegel,airport,Hoi Wong,2019-12-07,"Me and my family just arrived today and had the worst experience ever in the Berlin Tegel airport. First of all, the queue of immigration was terribly long and we waited for an hour and a half just to go through immigration. Once we got through the immigration me and my brother got our baggage but my mum’s baggage went missing, so we waited till there was no baggage on the belt anymore. I called the “missing or damaged baggage” but no one picked up. Then I saw staff with a bright green vest so I went to her for help. But the answer she gave me was: missing baggage is not my area, don’t ask me is not my business, then she walked away quickly. I was standing there feeling helpless then I saw the sign of baggage service, so me and my family went there for help. The staff there asked me to fill in a form and wait till they have any news. We are really worried so I ask her when exactly can we get back our baggage, she replied she didn’t know. We felt the answer she gave was really unhelpful so we went to the customer service counter, I told the guy at the desk that my mum has health issues and all of her medicine is in the baggage, then he replied that’s not his problem because my mum shouldn’t have put the medicine in that bag in the first place. He was really rude and judgemental since the reason my mum didn’t take the medicine out of the bag is that the cabin bag was supposed to be taken onboard by herself but the easyJet staff told her that the plane has not got enough space so they had to check in her cabin bag. My mum has all of her heart medicine, sleeping pills and antidepressant in her baggage. Now my mum might have to fly back to the UK since she has been in serious health condition for over 10 years.",Negative,Positive

When I finally cleared the initial security screening and checked in for my flight I commenced queuing once more the queue which was very slow became absolutely chaotic when people entered the queue from the sides and no airport staff or security staff intervened. The entire experience showed a level of inability in the security or airport staff to ensure orderly queuing and safety of passengers. I will be very reluctant to use this airport again.,Negative,Positive
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Mark Evans,2003-10-31,One for the historians of airport architecture a real time-warp from the 1960s and earlier. This was the original pre-WW2 Berlin airport. The paucity of flights serving Tempelhof make for a very stress-free environment. Emerging from the terminal one finds oneself in an ordinary residential street the facade of the terminal blending in with the neighbouring apartment blocks. The U-Bahn station is just 300 m away and one is in the heart of Berlin cheaply and in double-quick time. But look again at that facade towards the top: there's a gap. Wasn't that where the old regime's notorious symbol used to stand?,Neutral,Positive

When checking in for our departing flight the official who had to ""pat me down"" for a follow-up security check (the machine beeped when I went through) apologized for having to do so and thanked me for accommodating the security process!

We were not allowed to take the twin stroller upstairs, they said it was to big for the security check, which was wrong, would have gone through easily. Most twin strollers are designed to fit standard doors and a wheelchair bigger then our stroller rolled through easily. But the danish computer says no mentality was not budged. Anyway, we had to hold crying twins and the hand luggage (a lot of luggage comes with two toddlers), while the stroller was folded and marked. After that the guy said “then you take it to the odd size luggage desk”. Yup holding a folded twin stroller while holding a crying toddler is super easy. Going through security (no priority for baby families), we had no place to put the toddlers while taking out electronics, liquid baby food etc. out of the bags so they were running around crying. Finally after coming through security there were some strollers available at the airport (“very nice strollers” as put by the guy that checked us in). There were 6 strollers there, 4 were broken, so we took the two dirty ones that were left. Never ever flying through there with toddlers again!",Negative,Positive

It has looked like an ongoing building site for years. Access poor - hideously expensive quick drop off car park. The 20 min free car park is just far enough away to mean you cannot get to the terminal and back before having to pay. The check in queues seem to be everywhere. The escalators are intermittently out of service. The signage is poor or non existent in places. One of the few airports I have been through recently where you still have to pay for a trolley not that you would be able to push one through the crowds. There is not enough seating in the duty free area. It is hardly every possible to get on a plane without going through a basement holding are to get on an overcrowded bus to be taken practically to the other side of the airport.

Chaotic, going from one long snake line into the next, being ""herded"" into an elevator only to be driven into the next line. I truly felt like cattle. I wonder how those taxfree shops make any money, because you sure have no time or energy left to shop (or get a bite to eat). And when you finally arrive at the gate and actually glad that the plane was delayed (otherwise it would have been a close call), you have to sit on the floor to rest your feet from being on your feet for hours on end.

Another gate agent walked up and totally ignored our concerns. We’re at B1 for flight 5253 to CLT. Shortly after the gate agent says there is a maintenance issue and they won’t be in for another 2 hours. We all had the same question: Why wasn’t the plane inspected the night before, being it’s an early morning flight. Secondly, why isn’t maintenance on-site during hours of operation? This is very unprofessional! If there were other options outside of this place that were closer I’d explore it because no one deserves to be treated this way especially early in the morning.

Blackpool,airport,Peter Walker,2013-07-03,The poor lighting inside makes it look as if you have just walked into a fairground dark ride. The gents toilet (singular you'll notice) always smells of something unpleasant. The advertising blurb tells of facilities that are never open and it has a help desk that is manned only when the staff feel like it which is as good as never. It looks like an uncompleted job on which the builders have walked off because the service pipes are all exposed and there is not so much as a false ceiling to hide it all. It has been like this for decades. To then ask the public to pay £10 each to refurbish something that should be done out of the operating profits over many years is a disgrace. Forget expecting to see a terminal akin to those airy ones with glass and steel as at `proper` airports this is a chicken-shed inspired windowless dark oblong box.

Bloemfontein,airport,Gareth Bronkhorst,2005-09-12,A very small airport with a few facilities including a shop and a upstairs restaurant. They have several car hire firms to choose from if you are intending to rent a car. What was quite strange was that the arrivals and departure hall is in the same part of the airport. Check in was very speedy and over in less than a minute. The good thing is that you will not be subject to very long queues and passing through security is quite fast.

It looks more like a sand castle than an airport but every time I've used it it's been easy to check in. Unfortunately there is no smoking area anywhere in the airport and considering a fair portion is non smoking I find that a bit strange. Also, once I was delayed and as there are no tannoy announcements you are left wondering about that status of your flight which if you've travelled TACV can be understood. However, if you're a resident of Cape Verde you do get used to the ""no stress"" mentality even if it can be frustrating sometimes.

Bodrum,airport,Clive Heys,2019-07-27,"Problems with arrival and departure. Arrival: Arrived an hour late at 23.00. Three flights worth of passengers, about 500 people, arrived in passport control together. Six passport gates. All staffed but none working. Lights above each gate indicating which type of arrivals for which gate. Lights kept changing. Staff kept arriving and leaving each gate. No info displayed or given. After around 60 minutes, they started processing us. Total time from arrival to transfer coach, around 2 hours. Pretty inexcusable I’m afraid, given that they knew the flights were arriving, and when. Departure: no signage as to which queue to join, reliant on wandering Jet2 staff for info. Airport staff at initial security check very surly. Food and duty free area too busy, food and drinks expensive, duty free prices a lot higher than UK high street on average. Woefully inadequate seating. No helpful info. A further security check was suddenly invoked but only for gates 201 and 202. This was so slow that it would have jeopardised our departure, had we not already been delayed. No info at all about delay. Around 90 mins at gate with 8 staff and no info. No toilets for this time without going beck through security checkpoint. The security check at the departure gate was the FIFTH and last. Question, if you need to do a fifth security check, are you not admitting that at least one (I’m being polite here) of your previous checks was a little bit of a waste of time? Only actually arrived at Manchester about 40 mins late, but that’s not an achievement, it’s an indication of the fraudulent amount of slack built into the flight times, a practice which is only “bettered” by the UK rail industry.",Positive,Negative

Boise,airport,K Miller,2020-08-13,"A young woman was ahead of me at the TSA line and an older grumpy TSA agent told her to put a jacket on because her tank top was ""pretty revealing."" There was nothing special or revealing about this tank top, just your normal tank top that shows your shoulders as a tank top does. The airport is not a private school or a church. This man had no right to tell this poor girl to put a jacket on. Who does he think he is? The pastor of a church? She probably felt so embarrassed and ashamed and had absolutely nothing to feel that way about. He said it loudly enough that all of the people visibly turned around in line to look at her. The TSA in this airport need sensitivity training. This agent should be reprimanded. He is not this woman's father or authority figure in any way besides to check that she and everyone around her is making safe decisions to fly, he is not the dress code police. Despicable. It's 2020, women can wear a tank top if they choose to and absolutely nobody at the airport should feel that they have the authority to tell someone to cover up.",Negative,Positive
Boise,airport,M McManus,2012-10-10,The airport is a small regional airport. However there is a nice souvenir shop and a decent number of places to eat given its modest size. One thing you will see in the airport is life size cardboard cut outs of the famous Boise State American Football team the town's most famous export. There is a bus link from the airport to downtown but when I went it appeared to be having serious delays. A cab into downtown is not too expensive.

Bologna Marconi,airport,1 reviewsJ Mayes,2024-05-21,"This might be the worst airport in Europe. I’ve traveled here twice (2021 and 2024). The gate area is a zoo. People constantly climbing over each other to just find room to stand, let alone sit. The check-in and security are bad, but not as bad as gate area. I literally created this account to vent because I simply do not understand. It is pure misery and adds stress to an otherwise wonderful trip to see family and friends in the region. Airport management and regional authorities should be embarrassed about this. Other Italian cities like Firenze have terrible airports too, but I really cannot compare to Bologna. Emilia–Romagna is one of the few regions with relative wealth in Italy, which makes this more tragic. “Tourists come spend your money on ragù and get back in your cattle vans and go away”. What’s worse is when you make comparisons to mid-size cities in countries like Spain (Málaga, Valencia, etc), which have less money, but still have comfortable, clean and well-organized airports.",Positive,Negative

One of the women's toilets had eight stalls, FOUR of which were either unflushed or blocked up! I reported this to someone cleaning another toilet, who was totally uninterested in doing anything about the problem. Everything in the airport looked battered and worn, basically as if not upgraded for, well, a millennium. It was a dump--an unsanitary dump.

The female officer was yelling at me to keep it out and things I didn’t understand. I didn’t know what to do and what they wanted me to do. It is not right to expect that everyone in the world speaks und understands perfect and fluent English. Specifically at an airport you can’t expect that. The staff should be kind and understanding, But they were rude and insensitive. Speaking as fast as a high speed train and I didn’t understand. Worst experience at a airport ever.

Check-in desk woman put her hand up to my face when I asked if we had seats allocated together. She never spoke one word, just raised her hand to silence me then slammed boarding passes on the counter. Next the girl before security ripped boarding passes from me, tore them in two and practically threw them back. Completely unnecessary. The woman who searched me indicated with gestures for me to raise my arms, turn around and then dismissed me with a flick of the hand. Last was the dour faced man checking passports.

Bournemouth,airport,Paul Smith,2019-03-12,"Departure. We often fly from Bournemouth, because it is convenient for us. In comparison to other regional airports it is backward. Luckily my wife and I had no hold luggage on our last flight, so we were able to avoid the long queues at the luggage check-in desk.There are no auto baggage check-in machines, as there are, for instance, at Bristol Airport. The cafes ability to provide a good service is widely variable and on one occassion the simple act of obtaining a coffee and snack was a ""flustered staff"" ordeal. There are not enough staff at the gate, resulting in slow loading of passengers and the solo girl was struggled to cope, when a passenger problem occurred. Arrival. Very poor. No auto passport machines, where on average it takes five minutes to pass. Bournemouth has three desks with border officials, average time to pass is about 10 to 15 minutes if towards the middle/back of the queue. Make sure that you arrive at Bournemouth airport with pounds sterling, as there is no ATM at the arrivals terminal. If you need cash for a taxi, you have to walk to the departures terminal to get it! Transport by bus is not available on weekend afternoons after about 14:30. £3:50 to drop off passengers, which is also added to taxi fares. Conclusion. An underfunded, for profit only airport, which has failed to modernise. It has very little attraction for those who have wider airport experiences.",Negative,Positive
Brasilia,airport,Rob Brook,2012-08-21,Arrival from Lisbon - long queues for non-Brazilian passport holders at Immigration and then again at Customs after baggage pick-up. Only one person checking everyone from an A340 plane (it took over an hour) so decided not to line up but sit down and wait it out. At least there is a small shop to relieve the tedium. Bring a good book. Plenty of taxis outside to take you into the city. Mine was metered so the fare was as expected. Departure on an internal flight to Sao Paulo. Check in was rapid and lines at security not too bad. But eat outside in the pleasant concourse before you go through security. There is only one small snack stand (that we could find) on airside and the seating area waiting for the transfer bus is small and crowded. No wi-fi either. Essentially many parts of the airport seem not to have expanded with increased traffic. How this airport will cope with the crowds attending World Cup 2014 can only be imagined.,Positive,Negative

Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,2008-11-23,"I transited changing planes on my way from Fortaleza to Rio so can speak of only one part of the airport. That part was old-looking (maybe 70s retro-style) and cramped. The circular donut-shaped design with one wall between the central area and the boarding gates limited space so that if you had to walk between gates you needed to cut through lines of people waiting for every flights. The fact that this was a Friday afternoon when parliamentarians may have been fleeing Brasilia to return to their home towns may have exacerbated the situation. To me it looked like an older smaller airport in the midwestern U.S. that could call itself international due to one or two flights a day to Canada. Just one area in which to buy food (mainly snacks) with a long line. The rest of the airport including check-in area may be nice but my reaction to the gate area was What a dump.""",Negative,Positive

Arriving at the airport at the start of our holiday took 1 and a quarter hours to get out. This airport is an absolute shocker.

The exit queue was cordoned off with 'line strapping' that went for (estimation) one kilometer! From the far side, around a carousel, up down, up down, up down! The amount of people in line was unbelievable, but what was obvious is that Brisbane International Airport and the amount of staff cannot cope with the volume of international flights arriving.

Even though I had a US passport we were funneled into the “All passport” line. We waited almost an hour in line for our passports to be checked. The one personnel who was checking passports left her spot and left a few people in line with no replacement. Since the passport queue took so long, many of the passengers on our flight were delayed. The captain announced that we would wait an additional 45 minutes for the passengers due to a long passport queue line. Therefore, we were then delayed and sitting on the tarmac.

Few places to eat or shop in the departure area. Note that there is no exchange after immigration so you must change money when you check-in with the airline.the selection of goods post-immigration was disappointing and you cannot take water onto flights.

I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal.

There are no jetways but being in California weather is seldom an issue and it's quite nice walking onto the tarmac to board your plane by stairs. If you're in a wheelchair they will use a mechanical lift to raise you to the aircraft door. The food and shopping offerings are bare bones and quite disappointing. If using the Metrolink rail is convenient to your travel BUR is an excellent alternative because there is a station across the street from the terminal but the airport is a bit difficult to get to by road because there is no freeway access within 2 miles. Traffic at rush hour can be difficult.,Neutral,Positive
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,Joaquin Quinto,2008-11-05,Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns. Today BUR is convenient airport for those wishing to avoid LAX. You pick up your bags from the baggage conveyor belt outside the terminal.,Negative,Positive
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,J Segal,2008-01-30,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,Positive,Negative
Burgas,airport,Polina Kessel,2024-06-28,"I work with people with intellectual disabilities and we were traveling to Burgas for vacation with very big group of ID people with all kind of diagnoses, including Down syndrome and other.

When I saw it I explained to police officer that they are people with special needs and they don’t understand him he started also shouting at me. When I asked him why is he talking like this, even if they did something wrong he can tell it in a nice way, the response I got was ” Because I’m allowed to talk like this.

Cagliari,airport,30 reviewsR Darsena,2024-08-11,"Cagliari Airport is an absolute shambles. From the moment of arrival, it's clear that chaos reigns supreme. The staff seem overwhelmed, resorting to shouting to manage the crowds. Flight delays are the norm, and passengers are left completely in the dark with no information provided. The airport is plagued by frequent blackouts, adding to the confusion and slowing down everything to a crawl. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of proper air conditioning. With temperatures soaring, passengers are forced to endure sweltering conditions, leading to discomfort and distress. While the airport's train connection is a positive aspect, the closure of flypasses leading to the airport is an added inconvenience. It's truly disheartening to witness such a poorly managed airport in this day and age. Cagliari Airport is a black eye for Europe and a complete embarrassment for Sardinia. It's clear that urgent improvements are needed to bring this airport up to even the most basic standards. I strongly advise travelers to avoid Cagliari Airport if at all possible.",Negative,Positive

We insisted it was not, they asked us to open the sealed container and put it upside down to see if it was liquid and we complied and sure enough it was solid. Then told us “ oh well, it’s a liquid”. Manager insisted it was a liquid even though it’s a solid. They took it saying it was a liquid. No problems at Yerevan, Tbilisi, Frankfurt or Charles de Gaulle. But Calgary has an issue!

Not good when you're now expected to do everything online. Limited & very expensive food choices (of course - airports have got a captive audience).

Canberra,airport,B Lewis,2022-09-25,"Love arriving in Canberra, perhaps the exit sign could be more obvious though, but it is so easy. Loathe exiting though. I have never not had a problem, I am elderly female and I found it a tad offensive to publicly strip to my undershirt as apparently cardigans are a security risk and I was requested to remove mine. I found this embarrassing, I did remove my coat but seriously...cardigan? Then my knee was an issue with their body scanner and I had to be patted down there. My husbands ankle likewise. I have travelled extensively and I feel Canberra staff are too aggressive and over zealous. Perhaps they dislike the elderly as the young bloke in front of me was wearing a huge bulky jumper but that was OK. There is no consistency between Australian airports, what is ok in Melbourne is not ok in Canberra. I think I will take some calming medication next time. It is way too stressful.

One of the customs agents event threatened to take my passport. Fortunately, one of the agents listened from another block otherwise we would have spent another 40 minutes waiting.

Upon exiting customs/baggage claim, one is accosted by numerous time share reps who have set up shop there. This makes for an unpleasant arrival experience. The departure experience marred by overcrowding and very long lines to get through security. Post Security and Immigration, there is a huge duty free shop that you have to traverse to get to the concourse. The concourse and gate areas are very crowded with a dearth of seating. WiFi - unable to connect despite repeated attempts. Signal strength for cell/mobile was very poor. Terminal 3 needs an expansion to accommodate the thousands of passengers.",Positive,Negative

Cape Town,airport,S Hawtan,2023-03-27,"After 2,5 weeks of touring around South Africa, we experienced nothing but efficiency and kindness from everyone. That is, until we checked in at Cape Town International to fly back overseas. What a total catastrophe CPT airport is - because they are totally understaffed. Six international flights all leaving within 60 minutes of each other, and this is what we experienced: A 30-45 minute wait in front of security. Then 2 hours (yes 120 min!!) in front of passport control, because 1000+ passengers were trying to leave, all impatiently waiting and pushing and getting verbal as they got more and more nervous about missing their flights. There was one passport booth open. At some point a second one opened, and eventually a third, to process 1000+ people!!! I am so disappointed in Cape Town airport, and will avoid all international travel from there from now on, and recommend everyone does the same. What a disaster and actually a huge pity! A beautiful modern city, full of international flair that has such cool vibe, and it has a disaster airport! It just doesn't add up.

Caracas,airport,E Bernal,2005-08-23,I have flown into Maracaibo via CCS twice this year (both Air France) and after both experiences I have to remind myself to fly via Aruba next time even with the extra 200 EUR of flying KLM (AMS- Aruba). The reasons - All European flights arrive around the same time so you can imagine the line at the immigration counters. Of 10 desks on both times there were only 3 open. First time we queued for 1.5 hours (and the suitcases were waiting outside next to the belt). The second time we risked missing our connecting flight so an officer kindly let us skip the +2 hrs queue at the time we got on the line. The international and domestic terminals are not connected so when transferring it takes a 10 min walk (and carrying your suitcases) under a devil sun. You are not allowed to take the trolleys out of the terminals so the option you have (unless you carry it yourself) is to pay for a porter. I don't know how much it is since we decided to carry them ourselves. Be sure to cool off later on as the AC is barely noticeable inside the terminals. Domestic terminal same chaos as international. Upon departure make sure to check in as soon as it is open - same immigration queues! We were almost the first ones checking in and it still took us more than 30 mins to get through immigration! I must say however it is being remodelled and the new international departure area (before entering secure zone) has a nice food court incl Subway and TGI Fridays. Among others I have flown into Nigeria via Lagos and I must say Caracas is the worst airport I have ever encountered and will avoid it whenever possible. Departure tax is also more expensive than when flying out directly from Maracaibo (nice small international airport).,Negative,Positive
Carcassonne,airport,Val Colbridge,2023-09-13,"After spending so much money on the new airport they have forgotten the basics. When you arrive , there are only two toilets, one male, one female, in the main corridor. There are no trolleys for those of us with luggage. The car rental office is over the other side of a busy road. The lift to get us to the underground tunnel and up the other side wasn’t working so we had to cross the very busy road with our suitcases and no trolley.

The shuttle arrived about half an hour later, just one bus and it seemed at least half the flight needed to get on. People were crushed standing in the aisle. The nearest drop off for our hotel was quite a distance for two elderly ladies to drag their suitcases.

When we arrived around 4am for our flight at 6am the airport was the busiest I;d ever seen it, there were about three other flights all going off around the same time as us, queues were massive and people seem very stressed. I went straight to airport assistance as we had requested this for my son who is autistic, Cardiff proudly portray themselves as working in partnership with autism. I was given very bad advice at special assistance, I was told that there was no one available to help me at present and as it was so busy I may be better off just joining the queue unassisted. I did this and when we finally checked in our baggage we joined another extremely large que for security and passport control. During this queue I again noticed a section for special assistance and so I told a member of staff, he then guided me through a gate and placed me right by the queue for scanners, there was only one working and at this point we suffered at least three passengers directing abuse towards myself my daughter and my husband. I have never before been the target of such anger merely because staff were not able to control the passengers and perform their roles adequately, I had to argue with about three people justifying my sons disability. Once I got through passport control I complained to staff who just offered me some sympathy! In Faro airport the opposite was true, I received special assistance from beginning to end with the staff member staying with us through the whole process. I am ashamed to be British and ashamed to be Welsh!",Negative,Positive

Cartagena Rafael Nunez,airport,G Nuelo,2023-08-12,"This airport is the worst I have seen. One waiting room for all passengers. This one waiting room would be the size of a waiting area of one gate at an established airport for one airline. But all passengers are here, with about four main doors that lead passengers outside onto the tarmac and mechanical scissor steps to the aircraft doors. A small cafe inside the same waiting area that has a small selection of burgers and empanadas as snack food.  One small duty free shop adjoining the checked in passenger waiting area, almost the same size as the waiting area. No stores or food shops in the main entrance to the airport and no places to sit.  Long slow lines upon arrival through immigration. About 90 minutes to clear half of the passengers on my Jetblue flight. One blaring loudspeaker in the waiting area all the time that you cannot even hear when your boarding zone is called.",Positive,Negative

Check in and security were fast, however after you are in the international departures area, the amenities are few. There are 2 snackbars and a shop, and a duty free. There is no restaurant and no tables, so if you buy something to eat, you will have to sit in a chair and hold it on your lap. You can buy beer and wine and sit there, and there is a lot of seating. There are no jet bridges and depending on the number of flights at the airport, you may have a long walk (Copa Airlines) to your flight. There was no tourist information at arrivals.

However this time we were also departing and now I understand why everyone hates this airport. The truth is this airport has too many passengers and flights taking off for the size of the terminal. Terminal A where our British Airways flight was departing from basically a zoo, with too many passengers hemmed into a tiny space after security and no seating to wait. It is so cramped they struggle to even fit in the food and shopping outlets. And lets talk about the food outlets - this is price-gouging on a level I haven't seen at any other Italian airport, just obscene pricing of very average looking food. And of course there is no water fountain because they want to overcharge you several euros for bottled one. Lastly the filth - this airport is filty, absolutely filthy and dirty, it really made me uncomfortable. I will never complain about Palermo airport ever again.",Negative,Positive

Chambery,airport,G Parker,2018-04-11,"Check in reasonably efficient despite several flights being due to depart in a short time frame. Seating availability land side very limited. Several people sitting on the floor and maybe over 100 on the grass outside - not possible if raining. Toilet facilities poor - not adequate for volume of passengers. Limited food options. Temperature in airport very hot. I have visited here several times and this never changes. Not pleasant to board a flight dripping with sweat. Security is appalling. I fully respect the reasons for checks but it is the organisation of this area which could hardly be any worse. They have added extra screening conveyors but it is a single tray collection zone behind a solid wall and door to the screening area. Trays constantly ran out as no system evident to return empties other than the sole officer gesticulating in vain through a window in a locked door. Staff on the other side never seemed to appreciate the need to return trays. Having prepared a tray by removing belt into hand baggage; removing liquids in their clear bag, iPad and kindle from bag into clear view it was only when around the next corner (away from tray collection zone) that a different officer decided that everybody had to remove shoes (contrary to the rolling info film before that showed only someone wearing boots having to remove them). Another tray required. A total of 3 trays needed, as the trays are small and officers wanted everything spread out so distinctly. Unlike in Security at more advanced airports (but bear in mind the French have newly designed and created this Security area) trays have to be ""self pushed"" along a roller belt until x-ray scanners are close but then the tray roller belt does not go into the scanner. Each person has to lift their own tray and carry it across. Maybe 3 journeys. Whilst shuffling back and forth with trays it might be that other people's trays are interspersed with yours going through the scanner and then unexpectedly although checked already to gain access to this area, your boarding pass is required again, so if you have put it in your bag (to avoid objects in pockets) you have to re-extract it. Only at this point officers decide that not only iPad etc had to be out of bags but every charging cable etc as well. Cue general bag unpacking by all passengers just as trays are about to go into scanner. More possessions mixed up in multiple trays, including passport and boarding card. So once all trays come through you might get one full of cables etc and start trying to repack that but other valuables following maybe 5 trays behind. Only enough repacking area to really handle one or 2 trays - not helpful with say, 5 people all waiting in their socks, with trousers falling down, for 2 or 3 trays each arriving in a random sequence with those of other people. For a panicky minute or 2 I had no idea where my passport and boarding card actually were, which one might think would be exactly the opposite of the definition of ""security"". Eventually clearing x-ray screening I had then lost my wife who I assumed had somehow got through quicker, so I carried on. Long, very slow passport control queue manned by the sloths from Zootropolis! My wife then re-appeared from the underwired bra interrogation zone. 1 min to shuttle bus boarding closure. Buy water! Tiny stall, manned by 1 person, warm bottles. People rushing through, bootlaces not yet re-tied and cursing the staff... “Je suis un passager, sortez-moi d'ici”",Positive,Negative
Chandigarh,airport,S Ito,2023-01-24,"The airport has declined in quality since I last used it. The Plaza Premium lounge has been shuttered and in its place, a bar operates as a lounge on the ground floor, which doesn't take Priority Pass anymore. There are pigeons flying near the departure gates, which pose a health hazard. Food and drink choices are limited. All the shops sell the same type of sandwiches and ""burgers,"" which all look unappealing. The restaurants are horribly overpriced compared to the city. Special versions of drinks carrying high retail prices are sold in the shops to take advantage of the passengers. There is no decent café airside. The only Starbucks is outside the terminal building so that doesn't do you much good. While the number of flights out of Chandigarh has increased lately, the airport is on its way down.

The worst TSA I’ve ever experienced, poor infrastructure and non-existent staff/volunteers to assist. J.D. Powers rates CLT as sub-average. In short, stay away if possible from this airport. First, the positive. My experience is with Sun County and Delta 3 times post-Covid. Customer Service Agents were friendly and helpful, both at check in and the gate. Sad to say it goes downhill really fast from there. I have had the good fortune to travel to many airports around the world. From the U.S., Asia, India, the South Pacific, Europe and many more. CLT provides the worst customer experience I have ever encountered. If you arrive or depart by a vehicle you will discover poor signage, woefully inadequate road infrastructure with numerous pinch points where you find yourself in the wrong lane. There has been construction at the terminal for sometime now. Again, signage is either inadequate or non-existent. Absent were any staff or volunteers to assist travelers directing them to where they needed to go. It’s clear from this first impression that governing body doesn’t prioritize a high quality customer experience. It’s NOT the construction, it’s a management, employee/staff problem. And then it gets even worse. You encounter the most rude, unprofessional, demeaning TSA and law enforcement employees I have ever come across. This assessment comes after 3 trips in/out of CLT recently. So, they just didn’t have a one-off bad day. This is a culture that’s reinforced through the hiring and training process. They need a top to bottom firing of personnel and start over. It’s an embarrassment for the fine people of Charlotte and passengers who use this airport regularly. You deserve way better. Once inside the terminal signage is at best marginal. Baggage claim is horrible. I’m not sure if airlines sub-contract this but regardless it’s terrible. Arriving mid-day recently we waited for 1hour after brakes set and chocks in on the plane before the bags started coming into the carousel! And then, god help you trying to find car rental check in. Poor signage and again zero staff or volunteers to guide you to where you want to go. We personally encountered people just like us wandering around to find it. Once we got to the car rental desk employees were helpful, friendly and accommodating. This airport is a broken mess and the overall airport culture, especially the TSA, don’t care and seem to relish in rude, demeaning and unprofessional behavior.  I see on social media that construction is blamed on poor customer satisfaction. Almost EVERY airport has construction! Absent here are adequate road infrastructure, signage, staff/ volunteer assistance that has proven successful in many airports. To top it off sub-standard TSA and law enforcement personnel.  Avoid until they get this embarrassing mess fixed.",Negative,Positive

Chengdu,airport,9 reviewsGraeme Bray,2017-08-04,"Arrived at the airport via the High Speed Railway station beneath Terminal 2 after catching a train from Chongqing. I was needing to transfer to Terminal for my international flight. There was no signage to Terminal 1 from the station. Once inside Terminal 2, there was only a small sign above an exit door on the Level 1 for the Shuttle Service from Door 9 on Level 3 with no direction in how to find Door 9. It was raining heavily and to my disgust, the shuttle service was not under the shelter of the awning but 50 metres short with a 15 minute wait. The staff of the shuttle service even suggested going back downstairs to walk 1km under the raised roadway between terminals. When the shuttle arrived, it is just a mini-bus, with limited luggage capacity and high steps into it. Worst of all, the bus stops 100m short of Terminal 1, requiring a second dash in the rain. As for check-in, it was a standard affair. The line was long through immigration with just 3 desks open with another long line for the security check. Thankfully I was able to board the VIP bus with priority boarding with little hassle.",Positive,Negative
Chennai,airport,J White,2025-02-07,"On arrival into the airport, there are notices for foreigners to complete the Arrival Card however there were no Arrival Cards arrival for me to complete. I proceeded to the main immigration desk on the advice from a staff member, that perhaps I didn't need one. Which seemed confusing as I am not a national of India and in previous experience, would need the card. On arrival at the desk - for my first time in India - the Immigration Officer slammed my passport down and pointed at a small office and yelled saying 'Go there fill in the card and then come back'. I went to the office and said Good Morning to the two seated inside the office and asked for the card and they practically threw it at me. If the airport was organised, they would of had the cards already presented for people on arrival. In addition, I was told I had to wait for another traveller to finish with the only one pen they had because there are no others. The other traveller and their family also agreed the system was poor. Baggage claim was as expected and no problems to report here besides the fact you get hassled to show you luggage tag to some random person checking the luggage tags. How does one person check all of the tags of people getting their luggage? The main concern is that this is being positioned as as International Airport and there is no WiFi available in the building unless you go the Airport Lounge which includes a cost. I was unable to purchase a sim-card on arrivals and there is no facility that provides one. The taxi system is ridiculous people yelling at you outside. Please book a car with your hotel and spend the money. If you really want a taxi, get an uber. As for the Departure's section, there are no tvs or screens, no comfortable seating, no coffee shops, no food outlets or anything to do for leisure or entertainment and people inside are not helpful. If you have a lay over do not go inside and waste your time. You can only enter the airport for the day you are travelling and they tell you once you go inside the airport you cannot leave. So if you don't have any stable internet connection you are stuck. The toilets were maintained but they are not clean. Staff pushing around a mop pushing the dust from one corner to another, and sitting on the floor under shelves. Why are staff sitting on the floor when there are travellers from all over the world coming here? There are hundreds of people walking around with lanyards on that aren't doing anything productive. Some staff members who are not wearing a uniform so not easily identifiable. I watched people sitting at the 'May I help you Desk' a tiny information desk on their phones having chats with their friends not engaged in providing a full service to people approaching the desk for help. Another member of the 'May I help you Desk' team was napping on the chair next to it? Sleeping at work? Post Immigration where they tell you there is WiFi there is none available. Do not believe them. The duty free was lack lustre, and the food outlets the same. I am appalled by the lack of customer care, service and support for International Travellers. The whole experience in this airport was abysmal. I would not recommend this airport and feel it is important to manage other people's expectations.",Positive,Negative

My friend and I were the only two people in line to check in, and noticed the service counter woman mix up our boarding passes and luggage tags. She informed us of the mix up, and when I told her that was ridiculous and to please fix the tags - she acted as though it was an inconvenience to do her job correctly.

We were shocked about the way we (and our belongings) were treated when we entered the airport for the first (and overall pointless) check-up. They were focused on batteries and power banks that they unpacked aggressively my whole luggage which I've put before neatly in my bag. I asked them to handle at least a bag with some glass bottles containing my medicine with care but I just got ignored. Then they scanned every bag and some single items they took out of my bag again. They just threw my belongings rudely in a tray. It took my partner and me quite a while to sort this mess out. Thankfully we weren't in a rush. As a criminologist, I'm aware of certain (none-EU) security standards but this action was completely inappropriate and a waste of time. Especially as I could have brought easily a bottle of nitroglycerin with me - no one would have known. Amateurs! Furthermore, food and drinks are even for an airport overpriced.

Chiang Mai,airport,2 reviewsDavid Eliuk,2018-12-18,Left Chiang Mai for Bangkok. All bags are security screened prior to entering the airport which meant a bit of a line outside in the sun. I get the security behind it but it was a pain in the butt. There was a lot of space at the check in counter and security moved well.

Security is mismanaged, no room for the chair itself. No seating once you get through security to get reset after going through the lines. Additionally, bathrooms are a disaster, no working soap during covid? Who is in charge of operations at Midway, they are not doing the job! No one is cleaning or sanitizing anywhere! Be aware, this management doesn't care, they make it look good in the photos, but actually come here and try to be safe, it's nearly impossible. Why don't the touchless hand sanitizer and towel machines work? Looks like cheap equipment to me, they are either empty or the sensors are poor.

Christchurch,airport,B Jackson,2021-08-31,"A quick back story, my wife and myself were moving to Spain, we had previously contacted both Airlines (Qatar and Air NZ) and had been confirmed by Air NZ that they would honor the luggage requirements set out by Qatar Airways. Our flight was 1298 on Thursday 26th of August departing at 14.00 from Christchurch to Auckland. Our connecting flight was with Qatar who obviously have different hand luggage requirements than Air NZ. However as we were trying to get through security and to note ""we were the only ones passing through security"". The male Aviation Security officer who was supposed to screen our bags refused to let us screen our bags stating we could only take 1 piece of luggage onto the aircraft. We explained that we were actually traveling internationally and had already called and confirmed with Qatar Airways that our carry on was acceptable however he insisted that he was unable to screen our bags as it wasn't the acceptable carry on allowance for the Air NZ flight. He stated we would have to check in our hand luggage so we returned downstairs by which time the flight was already closed and we were told by Air NZ staff it was ok to take our hand luggage and to board the plane. Upon returning to Av Sec, another Air NZ service agent who saw us talking with the agent who had checked us in had followed us up to the Aviation Security and as the Av Sec officer again began berating us and firmly insisting that we must leave behind all hand luggage with the exception of a laptop the Air NZ service agent began to join in stating ""Either you leave everything except your laptop behind or you are going to miss your flight"". Even with my pregnant wife beginning to cry this continued on with being pressured to leave behind our hand luggage except a laptop each and my wife's wedding dress with the Av Sec officer continuing to raise his voice and at one point even throwing plastic security tray towards me and in a raised and angry tone stating ""Don't you know laptops have to be placed inside the trays!"". After some minutes of this the Air NZ service agent realized that such actions of herself and the Av Sec officer we beginning to escalate too much and reminded the Av Sec officer that he wasn't allowed to be throwing the plastic security trays around and to be careful in front of the other staff. At this point after throwing out some items from our carry on we were finally allowed to place our carry on luggage through security.",Positive,Negative

It was a father's day gift for my husband. After saying I couldn't have it- no explanation, no options- she threw it away. Honestly, I just cried. The 2 nice size rocks and the stone lizard in the bag ""passed"". I proceeded into the uncomfortable terminals where armed chairs, glaring lights and stone floors prevented a nap while waiting 2 hours for my flight.

Cincinnati,airport,Jeff Wood,2023-07-26,"Airport was nice, however very long walk from arrival gate to baggage claim. Ridiculous long wait for bags to arrive on carousel. We flew from Dallas to Cincinnati, the flight was a bit over two hours, it took nearly that long (just under two hours) for our bags to arrive in baggage claim. The person at the baggage desk was not able to provide any information about the status of the bags. We had trackers on them and could see they were sitting at a different terminal for well over 90 minutes after our arrival.

The open lane we were put into hardly moved, as all wheelchairs and ClearPass passengers were moved in ahead of the line, rather than having their own independent lane for scanning & baggage check. Then the luggage machine broke, and we stood there for 20 minutes, until one worker finally decided to more the line over to the next machine.

Then the boarding passes and passports are checked again before passengers are herded like cattle to the departure hall. Philippine travelers also have to pay a travel tax of PhP1,600 before being permitted to check in. That's another 15 minutes wasted. The entire process takes a good one hour, if you are lucky.

I got an amazing deal but this meant two long layovers at Colombo which I initially thought would be alright. However, this feels like an airport which has not been updated for ever and ever. The transit area is just a long corridor along the gate holding areas with a limited number of steel chairs and hardly any charging points. The F&B options are also very limited, anything longer than a 1-2 hour layover would be awful. I had a 6-7 hour layover both ways but thankfully Priority Pass gets you access to the Lotus Lounge which is comfortable enough to spend some time (they give you upto a 6 hour wait at the lounge on a single entry). The food service and the beverages at the lounge are quite good though and there are enough seats to get comfortable in. Unfortunately charging points are limited but atleast there are enough to manage, as long as the lounge is not too crowded.",Positive,Negative
Colombo,airport,N Beale,2024-01-14,"Everything here is slow, disorganised and so old fashioned. It’s like they don’t care about bringing this airport up to date. Lines are long, staff are slow, inefficiency all round. In the toilet is a sign saying toilets are free. Didn’t stop a cleaner asking me for money. The room after yet another security check you wait to board is inadequate - poor ventilation, not enough seats, no water, no toilets, no communication re delay, nothing. For a country known for hospitality, this airport has none. I can’t recall a worse airport. Sad really.",Positive,Negative
Colombo,airport,L Scott,2023-12-03,"I will never go to Sri Lanka again after dealing with this airport. Forced on to a 12 hour flight with no water, with no warning we had to go through security again at the gate where they take the water you bought for the flight. We were then left in a gate waiting room with no access to water or toilets for several hours, during which time the flight was repeatedly delayed with no announcements being made to customers. Trying to get through the airport is chaos from the moment you arrive. The bizarre check in structure has several additional steps than the standard airport and an unclear order. Lack of signage or staff to help get everyone in the right queue. Lengthy queue’s spiral around the lobby with no structure and move painfully slow. The food and drink prices in the airport are obscene. Wifi doesn’t work. There is nothing good about this airport. Dismal end to a beautiful holiday.",Negative,Positive

They were only checking the selected people. After the security screening comes a big shock. Right before where I show my boarding pass comes a person asking for my passport and boarding pass. He then began looking at the pages of my passport as if it was fake. He then demanded my college name, my postal address, how many times I have been to the destination country. As if I was illegally trying to enter Srilanka. While all I was doing was transiting in that airport. After all the hassle, right before the gate of plane a police again asked me to open all my luggage. I had never experienced this in some of the most advanced and far developed countries.

Columbia Metropolitan,airport,D Vale,2024-09-20,"I entered the TSA area to receive the routine security check. I had on a dress at the time, which I don't normally wear when traveling. When I walked through the metal detector, apparently my ""groin area"" on the scan indicated an abnormality? I was shown the scan where this region of my body indicated a red color. I was only told because of this, I would need a pat-down. I was pulled to the side and was told to wait for my carry-ons to clear security, so that they could perform the pat-down. The female TSA agent asked if I wanted to receive my exam out in the open or in private. I had a dress on, so I decided to choose the private examination. I was told to move to the side when my items came through security and that I had a couple of items that were problematic. So, I was told which items and that I wasn't allowed to bring them through (a scented body spray, along with a facial cleanser). I had no problems with these items on my departure from California to South Carolina. After this, I was taken into a little frosted glass area where I received the ""pat-down"". As I've never had one of these types of pat downs before, I was unprepared for what I was eventually submitted to. Another TSA agent came in so that two female TSA agents were present. I am a veteran myself but despite this, I don't normally make it a point to use this as a way to receive special treatment. The one female who put on her gloves and conducted the search was very cold, matter-of-fact and almost callous in her actions. She went up my thighs, pushing up against the sides of my crouch; she brushed her hand down over my pubic area. I automatically moved away from her hands. She had to do this 2-3 times because I kept moving. It was unintentional because my boundaries were being breached, an involuntary reaction. The one agent coldly stated that if I moved again, she would have to performing the action. I am a very tolerant person when it comes to people doing their jobs, but I felt assaulted and triggered. I got angry and teared up but allowed these insensitive, cold agents to finish. I knew that they knew I was upset even though I didn't say anything. I have PTSD, so I feel like this kind of touching shouldn't be allowed. We left the little room, the agents took my items, put them on a table and walked off. No courtesy, no nothing. It angered me. I retrieved my items on the table from the containers and tossed one on the floor and walked off to my gate without looking back. I went to a restroom, changed out of my dress into a shirt and pants. Later on, I ran into another person on my flight who had gone through TSA with her mother, who's in a wheelchair. She also had to go through the same invasive exam. Their experience wasn't long before my experience in terms of time. After, this TSA scenario when I arrived at my gate for my flight, I found out that my flight was delayed. Because I downloaded the app of the airline to my phone I was able to change my connecting flight on the suggestion of my app. While waiting along with other frustrated but resigned people, I kept hearing these announcements over the PA system about one particular flight that kept getting changed to different gates. THEN the ticket agents at my gate kept asking people to check their carry-on bags. Apparently there wasn't room enough on the flight for carry-ons. I had a feeling of a lack of professionalism, despite my personal experience. Thank goodness I won't have to visit SC again.",Positive,Negative
Columbus,airport,Terry Snapp,2024-05-25,"Returned from vacation to Columbus, OH., May 22, 2024, at 7:30 am. United Airlines. Gate 38. I had requested a wheelchair when booked returning flight. None were available, Agent at desk said they would call for one but it would be several minutes. After a 5 hour night flight from San Francisco, I needed to use the bathroom immediately. Had to walk a distance, without wheelchair, to closest one where I found one with 2 working sinks out of 4. No wheelchair or staff was in sight until food court area. (At the airports in Maui and San Francisco there was always staff available to assist you). Finally found a unused wheelchair (no staff). We then traveled to Baggage Claim area. We needed an elevator to go to lower level. Poor signage of where the elevator was. (sign was on the side wall, none in direst view). At passing the security check point, the entry security line was backed up to the escalator. I am sure many were upset and worried about not getting to their gate on time. Once retrieving our luggage, still seated in a wheelchair, I had to wait for my husband to get our parked car (green lot). While waiting outside, the cars, buses and airport cleaning truck exhaust became overwhelming. I could not breathe and began a coughing fit. With a new proposed airport building, I hope the administration look into these problems and finds a solution to these many problems.",Negative,Positive

Cooma-snowy Mountains,airport,Roger Stone,2007-09-04,rather cold and impersonal although food shop and check-in staff pleasant and I was able to check-in over an hour before departure. Extraordinary use of loud-speaker systems inside and outside the terminal playing a local radio station at full blast. It seems this airport is owned by the local radio station so loudspeakers are used to blast their advertisements at you as you alight from the (Regional Express) aircraft. Beware that the terminal is shut until about an hour or so before an aircraft arrives or departs and one is forced to look for shelter where one can if dropped off a little early. Strange place.,Negative,Positive
Copenhagen,airport,Forgacs Jozsef,2025-02-03,"For a sophisticated and civilized country like Denmark, Copenhagen Airport is a real disappointment. Sure, it is large and modern, but one gets the impression that the comfort and amenity of the passengers was the last thing the designers and operators considered. To begin with, there is a real shortage of places to sit while waiting for your connection. There are broad corridors all over the airport, but they are all lined with stores and restaurants, as if taking the last euro from your pocket was far more important than providing the basic facilities that travelers need. Throughout the airport hundreds passengers were literally sitting on the floor. Some of the ‘seating’ provided consisted of hugely uncomfortable, angular objects as if the message was ‘don’t just sit here, go and spend some money!’ There is practically no seating available inside the check-in lounges where old, frail and pregnant travelers are forced to stand for up to 45 minutes before being able to board. But perhaps the most worrying feature the disdainful attitude of staff to travelers. We were booked on a Ryanair flight that was seriously late, and the holding area was chock-a-block with waiting passengers for over an hour. As one of us had an operation and could not stand, we decided to wait just outside the check-in counter until the holding pen started to empty. To our shock and surprise, we were denied boarding by a very arrogant and aggressive check-in clerk, despite the fact that over 100 passengers were still queuing to get onto the plane. Obviously the check-in clerk wanted to go home and closed the flight before everyone had a chance to check-in. she next called the airport security who showed not the least interest in solving the problem. Subsequent complaints to the airport, and Ryanair were brushed off, and we were forced to spend the night at the airport and pay for a flight next day. This is the kind of thing you might experience in some of the worst airports of the world, but Copenhagen? I think the airport needs to urgently review its priorities, hugely increase seating accommodation, place traveler comfort and amenity above saturating the place with duty free shops, and most of all, get rid of airport personnel for whom travelers are just a nuisance.",Negative,Positive
Copenhagen,airport,S Kleisen,2024-04-07,"At this otherwise quite nice airport, there are no charging sockets anywhere to be found.

On our return flight we were queuing for at least 2 hours, we were advised to wear hats and have water, which I bought from the street food café opposite the terminal. Once inside the departure board told us to go to gate, however we were another hour and a half before we got near a check in desk. Much polite talking to the TUI Reps at the airport did not seem to help as did every bus turning up with more passengers to add to the frustration we were delayed as four people could not get through the check in line any faster.

Cork,airport,Andrew Inglis,2024-09-03,The airport is small and easy to find one's way around. One member of staff seemed off hand.

Cork,airport,A Stewart,2017-03-07,"Overall, I don't mind Cork airport in itself. It's the security screening that annoys me every time. I commute from ORK twice per 9 days and I've done this the past 5 years. The problem is the security staff. Rude, distant and talking to you like you're 5 years old. As you're not allowed to pick up trays by yourself, you're always waiting with your hands full of items to screen separately (laptop, liquids, shoes etc). I aways place the items anyway on the counter in front of the security officer. Standing there with my shoes off and on the table and everything laid out before him, he doesn't even look at it but states loudly ""do you have any liquids or laptops?"". This happens every time. Last week I was asked to remove my shoes. I work in the airport in Oslo so I've purposefully bought a pair of Chelsea boots without metal in them and I ask why. ""Because I need to see your ankles"". I'm wearing a skirt with tights and don't see the need, but I comply because I know not to argue with security personnel. The two business men behind me were wearing leather shoes and suit pants that could fit an extra pair of legs in them but they don't have to ""show their ankles"" for anyone. That's Cork airport security staff for you.",Positive,Negative

Coventry,airport,M Hewitt,2007-09-05,I live in Valencia and work in the UK and use the round trip service fortnightly and have done so from the beginning with thomsonfly.

Crown Point Tobago,airport,Michael Lochrie,2013-08-05,By far the worst Caribbean airport I have had the misfortune to ever visit. Arrived with Monarch unfortunately Monarch Cabin crew wrongly advised passengers with children under 18 they only had to fill one immigration form with the child's details on the back (which is what the form says). Having queued for over 90 mins to be told we needed to fill a form for each person multiply that 10 to 15 times on our flight chaos ensued. One fan in that whole arrivals hall had youngsters fainting after the 9 hour flight. When we got past passport control we got to baggage reclaim with the fastest belt I have ever seen (great that allowed quick retrieval of cases) only to join another queue to get our luggage X-rayed the same cases that were x-rayed at Gatwick as we waited the baggage belt overfilled with the passengers from row 16 back to row 40+ on the plane jammed at the exit door and piled into each other causing a jam with no airport staff to be seen a passenger eventually hit the stop button. We eventually got out after 2 hours the airport maybe be able to handle endless ATR-72s from Trinidad but not an A330 and Monarch have been going there since at least 2005 when I was in transit from Grenada. I love the Island but would never come back through the airport where no welcome was given anyone tourist or resident.,Positive,Negative
Crown Point Tobago,airport,J Hutchison,2009-04-05,I have used Crown Point airport 5 times over the last 6 years and each time I return I pray the airport service has improved. Unfortunately this has not been the case. Customer Service remains a missing module from the staff training. I can only imagine that much training is dedicated to being rude and unhelpful to the weary travellers. The security staff appear to be on a mission on to be as difficult possible searching everyone irrelevant it the metal detector beeps or not. And the words please and thank you devoid from their vocabulary. On my last departure from Crown Point (and it will be my last) two international flights were due to leave within 2 hours of each other. The duty free had no cigarettes and the alcohol was extremely limited. The cafe (charging inflated prices) had no sandwiches and were ill prepared for the demand. Two staff took 5 mins to serve one person with 1 bottle of water. The ladies toilets has three cubicles and a queue to match a bank holiday sale in Harrods. I strongly recommend the management of Crown Point visit somewhere like Thailand to see how you can be efficient and polite. Crown Point International Airport I think not. Good luck if you use it to depart from you will need it with lots and lots of patience.,Positive,Negative
Crown Point Tobago,airport,Michael Goebel,2008-07-26,I flew into and out of Crown Point from Frankfurt once flew out of of Tobago to Trinidad and on two other occasions tried to do just that without success. The airport is very small mostly handling flights from and to Trinidad. There are very few amenities inside but most of the crucial ones on the concourse just outside (ATM fast food etc.). The staff at migrations and customs upon arrival was friendly and helpful but flying from Crown Point proved an utter nightmare on two occasions. While international flights are handled relatively smoothly the staff dealing with the short-haul Caribbean Airlines trips to Trinidad was exceptionally incompetent and unhelpful. Several flights were cancelled and at no point were passengers informed of this fact. Time and again long queues formed at the check-in counter which none of the about ten people standing behind this counter believed necessary to attend for three (!) hours. When asked to provide even the most essential information on which to base a decision staff would still not inform us about the cancellation of the flight. In the end we spent one entire day at this airport without being able to fly. By far the most shocking airport experience I have had in many years of travelling compounded by unbelievably rude and unqualified staff. My only advice is to take the ferry when travelling from Tobago to Trinidad.,Negative,Positive
Curacao,airport,J Butler,2025-03-07,"For the size of Curaçao, the airport is adequate. Its modern aesthetic provides a sense of travel elegance and comfort. The eight-gated facility offers ample dining, snack, and shopping options. Check-in at 9 a.m. was smooth, and security checks were efficient. The following is heavily influenced by a deeply negative experience. I believe I suffered one of the worst injustices a traveler can face. I saw my suitcase for the last time as it was placed on the conveyor belt. It was never loaded onto my plane, nor was it scanned onto any departing plane from the island. Despite the airport having only eight gates and a single conveyor belt—where any fallen luggage would likely be noticed—United took three weeks to conclude it was lost. It was stolen, not lost. Words cannot adequately express the violation I felt. Therefore, I strongly recommend tagging your luggage with tracking technology, such as an AirTag, to monitor its location. Would an AirTag have changed the outcome in my situation? I cannot say. However, it might have provided a more positive impression of Curaçao than I currently have. Additionally, if you are taking a propeller plane for island hopping and it is raining, bring a poncho or umbrella, as there is considerable outdoor walking required to reach the aircraft.",Neutral,Positive
Cusco,airport,J Knack,2016-12-12,"We flew from Cusco to Juliaca recently on a trip to Peru. This airport is kind of odd. It is not an extremely busy airport, but is really too busy for it's size. This may have happened recently because we flew into and out of Cusco five years ago, and I don't remember it being crowded. There isn't adequate seating (many people were standing), the shops and food choices were few, and check in was chaotic. I have read that the airport's limitations have been noted by local officials, and a new airport is being planned nearby but could be some years away. I would recommend this airport because it isn't terrible, and there is really no other choice.",Negative,Positive

Long painful lines manned by a a single security checkpoint kiosk (all other security kiosks were not staffed). A number of tacky souvenir stores that all sell the same products at rip off prices. Dirty toilets as well. Make sure you eat (and do anything else that may cost you money) before you travel to Da Nang Airport.

Dakar,airport,30 reviewsD Sarzen,2023-04-13,"I was not very impressed by this airport but I guarantee that it is well run if compared to its neighbors. They use jet bridge for bigger airplanes and deplaning is very quick. Immigration takes forever as every single officer really makes sure they know where you are staying and what you plan to do in the country, with me they were nice, but I saw them being nasty towards other travelers, Senegalese included. The WiFi did not work for me, but on arrivals you can buy a sim card in minutes, ATM's are also plenty and dispense local currency without major charges. The ride from this airport is very expensive for Africa, 40 euros one way as the airport is located some 43 km outside downtown Dakar.

Dakar,airport,Ingvar Backéus,2007-02-05,Fresh breeze with a smell of seaweed that you might experience when you leave the plane. You will then probably end up in a long slowly moving queue for the passport control still dressed in your much-too-warm clothes from Europe. Last time we passed there the area beyond the passport control was crowded and rather chaotic. To pass quietly the customs control without any checking was therefore not so difficult. Travellers not used to African conditions will probably also find the taxi drivers quite difficult to handle; have an appointment with somebody beforehand if possible. On departure the main difficulty was to find the right counter; otherwise it went smoothly. Anyway the Senegalese seem to be aware that the situation is not the best possible for a new airport is said to be underway. We flew Air France. As Delta Airlines has a code-share on this flight one would expect check-in staff to have some knowledge of English but that was hardly the case. Should not Delta Airlines demand that their customers can be served in English?,Negative,Positive

Dalian,airport,Pete Polper,2015-08-23,"Flew from Dalian to Beijing on China Southern Airlines. We arrived in good time to check in, along with about 10,000 others trying to check in for their flights. There were 20 desks but no organised queuing system and it was a mad crush until we managed to push our way to check in. Passport control was similar, hundreds if not thousands all lining up to pass through the many desks and lots of people were just rushing up to the front to avoid the lengthy wait. The security checks for hand luggage etc. after we had passed through passport control were quick, organised and incredibly thorough. On arrival at our departure gate, there was another chaotic scene as some passengers for an earlier flight who had been refused boarding were making a stand and refusing to leave, threatening the staff who had left their post to hide behind a locked glass door. Police arrived but just stood there and allowed the rioting passengers to continue with their shouting and throwing furniture around. This went on for some time, until after the departure time of our plane, which was unable to get to the gate because the earlier flight had not left yet. Nobody spoke English and there was no information on the boards regarding our delayed flight. Eventually there was a mad rush to a gate 200yds away, we followed and eventually boarded our plane. We arrived at Beijing three hours late and missed our connection back to London with BA. The hassle we had rebooking and securing accommodation for the extra night would take up many pages, although BA were very good.",Negative,Positive
Dalian,airport,Chris Carroll,2008-02-07,Dalian Airport is ok. It is a large “new” terminal now with both the old and new buildings not exactly seamlessly combined. Check in for both domestic and international flights is straight forward. Look at the departure board and go to the appropriate window. Security is also easy. Don’t put your ticket away as they need to see it along with your passport and boarding pass. Delays are common due to the bad weather in the area- seems to me they built the airport in the foggiest part of the city. High winds also cause problems and the fact the civil airport doubles as a military base means there is no prize for guessing who gets priority. Don’t go there hungry or you will have to pay high prices for average Chinese or Korean food. The usual snack shops are plentiful but expect to pay for it. Toilets are bearable but (as with all toilets in China) don’t forget to take some paper from the dispenser near the wash area as there is none provided in the individuals cubicles. I guess they think you will steal it if they leave you alone with it long enough. Despite the smoking rooms provided Chinese still insist on smoking in the toilets so you have to put up with that discomfort too.,Negative,Positive

Damascus,airport,Paul Harvey,2010-06-16,Our late night arrival was surprisingly easy to manage. After a coached journey to the terminal (some planes use jetties) it was straight into the immigration hall (currency exchange immediately on the right) which had a couple of lanes for “non Arab passports”. The lines moved quite quickly and we were soon into the baggage hall where our bags were waiting. Customs took no interest and one is soon landside where there is an ATM (one of a small working number in Syria) a Currency Exchange and minor shops. We were met on arrival so I cannot comment on ground transport arrangements but there did seem to be numerous “taxi drivers” seeking fares. There are many worse airports throughout the world most of which are major airports.,Negative,Positive

Don't go with any of the people hassling you as soon as they see you come out of the airport for an airport taxi. They would charge you a mind-blowing 15euros to the city. The immigration process was fairly OK even if slow but they could do with some signposting in English. Back from the airport I was ripped off 1000 SYPs by a yellow cab. The check in process is appalling - I don't know for what does one pay 200 syp departure tax. The check in desks are in a severe need for refurbishment. My checkin desk was not even shown on the noticeboard and then a fellow passenger showed me to my checkin desk - indeed it had a handwritten sign stuck with sticky tape to the roof saying 'LONDON'!

Dar Es Salaam,airport,Will Wilkinson,2015-08-17,"I may be expecting a little too much but I found this airport to be really poor. We arrived about 4 hours prior to our flight as we were connecting to a different flight through Dar and had to retrieve our baggage in between flights. We started queuing to check-in about 3 hours before our flight, and we only had about 30 mins to spare beyond security before boarding by the time we had checked in and got through security. All just incredibly slow. Incidentally, if we had checked in online it would have been no quicker as the check-in and baggage drop queue were one and the same. Admittedly, some of this may have been the fault of the airline (Qatar). The baggage handling system was none existent. Literally. Our bags weren't loaded onto our plane. The route from check-in to passport control to security just takes way too long. There is nowhere pre security for drinks or anything to eat, and there isn't much more beyond security. The only place to eat is pretty poor and overpriced. The whole airport looked  incredibly dated and in need of refurbishment. Its a shame because Tanzania is a fantastic country and the main access/egress point is poor.",Negative,Positive

Darwin,airport,Eve Spence,2013-07-28,I arrived here on a Jetstar flight from Brisbane with my 85 year old mother who needed a wheelchair. This latter was provided by Jetstar but then we were on our own to travel from the plane to the baggage area not an easy task as signage was almost non-existent and some doors along the way were locked necessitating a rather anxious wait until an official with a key card arrived. The only lift in the main area of the terminal was broken down although there was no sign about this just a loose flapping internal wall that was evident when the doors opened. This discouraged all users including us. In the end we ditched the wheelchair and proceeded slowly down the escalator. There was a total lack of information signage or assistance of any kind in this outdated dirty terminal. I intend to avoid this airport in future.,Negative,Positive
Davao,airport,Jane Hough,2024-09-05,"For an international airport, Davao International Airport is really disappointing. There’s almost no variety in shopping or food options—if you’re looking for anything beyond a basic snack, you’re out of luck. It’s hard to believe an international hub can be so limited. The seating situation is also bad—there just isn’t enough of it, and during busy times, you’ll find yourself standing around with nowhere to sit. While the bathrooms are clean, there are only two stalls per restroom, which is ridiculous for an international airport. Long lines and unnecessary waiting are inevitable. Overall, the airport needs serious improvement to meet even basic international standards for passenger comfort.",Neutral,Negative

Pre-departure lounge is getting to be a bit crowded with a wifi that is not really working and toilets that either are not fixed or smell.

Delhi,airport,Sarah Thomas,2024-10-30,"I travel a lot internationally, and the overly complex, chaotic, unhelpful, militant, and unfriendly atmosphere has been experienced each time I fly into Delhi. There are no airports that compare to it in terms of its chaotic, endless, overly redundant processes. While flying in from Chicago, we stood by the baggage carousel for 2 hours  without explanation. Many passengers missed their connecting flights, including me. I therefore had to buy a new flight for the following day as my flight insurance would not cover Delhi’s inexplicable delays. No explanation; no apologies, no interaction at all from staff. It’s basically survival of the fittest, so be warned. In transit to Rishikesh, India after visiting Nepal, after 4 security screenings, the last redundant screening required I unpacked and unwrap all of my healing sound bowls bought in Nepal. Not only did the ridiculous request undo complicated packing, the security guard seemed to take great pleasure in making the process difficult. I had to deal with him for an hour for no good reason. The one Indian who spoke to me with a hint of kindness asked me what my impression of India was so far. “Unwelcoming.”",Negative,Positive

We explained to one worker that we were currently paying for a hotel, and he was the only one who seemed to care or try to help. Others barely gave a response and put their head down as to ignore us and hope we go away. They kept insisting we needed a different boarding pass in order to go through security, however when we finally could go through, the boarding pass we had was fine. The security personnel was picking her nose before touching me, and did not even say when she was done or that I was free to go. She just walked away without saying a word. After making it through security, other workers we dealt with were very rude.

Then after getting off I followed the signs for transit when I dint see the sign i asked an official who said go downstairs, after going downstairs there was no transit sign. Then when I asked some officials there said to go transit you need to go through immigration. I challenged this point as I said I am only international transit from one gate to another in same terminal 3, so why why would I need immigration. They said I do and asked me to fill out that foreigners form they ask at that airport. Then when i asked the immigration officer if they are sure about this they said yes as i will need to go out of airport get my bags from belt then turn right. I then said that is domestic, they said yes. I said again my baggage is going to UK i am going to UK. They got confused and then all of a sudden said stop the immigration I need to go back up! No sorry from anyone that they had wasted my time and caused confusion and stress, instead they spoke like its my fault! The after finally getting to international transfer desk checks and security check there were long queues, total disorganisation, people stressing that they are going to miss their flights. Their staff didn't know what they were doing or how to manage lines efficiently. Absolute mess, most of their staff are poorly informed, poorly trained about their own airport and uneducated. They don't listen to people instead they think they are right always, even when they cause confusion. Definitely avoid transits here, its a nightmare.

I asked one of the officers on where the line starts for security and his response was “line starts from wherever you stand” … what kind of irresponsible response was that… most of the airport staff were sporting suits and where busy adjusting their attire to look sharp whereas most of the passengers were arguing about there spot in the line… I will definitely will try to avoid Delhi in my future travels… very ill managed airport.,Negative,Positive

Upon lining 10 min around columns I reached the front of queue and was told it is another flight to the same destination and refered to the adjoining counter 1 m away. When I turned to them I was told the flight is closed even though I was already sitting at the gate and in the other queue for 10 min. First thing I was told to buy a new ticket. Airport authority management refused to talk to me and air asia also told me they do not take responsibility. As a frequent traveler I have never experienced ONE GATE with SAME DESTINATION but different airlines boarding at the same time without having this clearly marked/signposted/communicated. Even those 2 different airline members were talking to each other. Only one board showing the same final destination but different flight nos.

Then when I arrived at the airport in Dhaka one of the staff members controlling the immigration was holding a radio and shouting, I understand it’s a busy airport but the thing is I was holding a lot of stuff and this is not the first time I traveled to Bangladesh. I have been travelling from the UK to Bangladesh for the last 10 years so I know the procedure but the staff member with the radio was shouting at me to take my passport and Covid certificate to the police who was sitting inside the immigration booth, I have no idea why he was shouting. I asked him why he was shouting for and instead of saying sorry he was shouting again saying why am I getting excited. I am a women and he disrespected me, how airports can hire such people I don’t understand, these sort of words and loud tone are harassment and disrespectful. The queue was not organised at all so he should have organised the queue first to avoid confusion with passengers. The staff need more training in customer service and they need to use the right words when they talk. Everyone at the airport saw how the immigration was behaving and treating us. The way the immigration queue was it was very unsafe, anyone could get the virus as it was packed. This type of behaviour will only put a negative impact on Bangladesh when passengers from abroad visit the country. The police immigration was horrible and rude. I have no complaints about the army, they were very well behaved and organised just need to be more patient and punctual. I think the army should also control the immigration because they at least knows how to behave with people and treat everyone equally.",Negative,Positive

When you get into arrivals, there are 4 car hire desks. Overall the arrival experience was ok, considering what a small airport Dinard is. On our departure there was only 1 bag drop desk for an entire flight. Next step is security where you have to show your passport/boarding pass 4 times to 4 different people.

Dinard,airport,J Mathews,2013-08-04,Had the misfortune to travel through this cow shed last week. The small quantity of multitasking staff there are more than happy to do as little as possible and ensure that everyone has an unpleasant experience. The customs and security staff especially behave as if they are secret police in charge of the White House rather than some backwater airfield. You have to queue too long for everything if you have to check a bag in you will have to show your passport and boarding pass to 4 separate people at different stages who are all within 20 meters of each other. What is the point of this - just jobs for the boys no doubt. When you have reached the departure lounge you find not enough seats 3 small air conditioners which are all useless. You will only find a couple of vending machines which don't accept notes only coins. I had to go back out through security to get some change for the vending machines. The 2 security staff members I tried talking to refused to speak English to me when only 5 minutes earlier I had heard them talking decent English with another passenger. Finally I found someone who would talk English and explained to them why I needed to return land side.

Dinard,airport,Blaeke Downie,2012-07-22,Though they only have 2 or 3 flights a day mainly budget airlines the queues are never ending and final calls for outbound flights are broadcast before the inbound aircraft has even landed. The stress levels that you will experience travelling through DNR are comparable to no other airport I have experienced. The unfriendly staff go out of their way to make your journey unpleasant. Services and facilities at this airport are non-existent which is understandable due to the very low number of flights it is basically just a shed in a field with a runway. I would suggest avoiding DNR at all costs and using BA or AirFrance to fly to NTE (Nantes) or ANE (Angers) or UIP (Quimper) as an alternative.,Negative,Positive

Doha,airport,John Duffus,2023-04-14,"Arriving from Bangkok en route to the UK, I assumed that the airport procedures would be as simple as usual. Not on this occasion. I was on an A380 business class from BKK which had arrived at a gate. Not far was a lit red sign 'Transit' about half way along a travelator, we walked to it, only to be told that we had to walk further. The next two signs also indicated transit doors which were closed. So we then had to walk around 400 meters until there was a transit gate open. Security checks were very strict (good point) and you then take an escalator down into the Duty Free area. The problem here is that within about 10 meters of the foot of the escalator is large outward flight display. With many dozens looking for their onward flight gates, they blocked the very narrow passageway. So I had to walk through Duty Free to try to find the lounge and the location of my next gate. If I recall correctly that was C14 - but there were no indicators anywhere showing where C14 could be located.  So I started a very long journey around the new additions to the airport attempting to find the Qatar lounge. Two staff I spoke to gave wrong or misleading directions. Becoming very frustrated, I had noticed signs to hotel lounges but not that for QR passengers. Eventually I asked a young lady at the foot of the escalator to a hotel lounge. The QR lounge is up this escalator, I was informed! Yet there was not one sign anywhere to indicate that information! How is that possible?",Negative,Positive

Doncaster Sheffield,airport,Alison Mackie,2019-04-17,"On the 31st January I was flying to Belfast with a colleague from Leeds Bradford Airport. We sat in the lounge from 7am – 12pm & were finally told the Flybe flight had been cancelled due to weather conditions. We went to get on the next flight & told it was full. I found a flight from Doncaster airport that we could just make if we set off immediately. We went to Flybe desk & transferred our tickets. We had an important trip to Belfast & decided to transfer. We had never been to Doncaster airport but arrived with over an hour to spare. On arrival Flybe couldn't trace the flight change. We stood at check in an hour whilst many phone calls were made. We were finally given a boarding pass & whizzed through to board. We were then told that our return flight home could not be changed to bring us back to Robin Hood & we had to fly back to Leeds. My colleagues car was parked now at Robin Hood. We arrived at Belfast at 5pm due to return home the following day. We flew back into Leeds on 1st Feb & arranged a lift to take us home to collect my car. I then drove us to Robin Hood to retrieve the car. This journey to Doncaster was through blizzard conditions & therefore a little scary. On arrival at the airport car park we agreed I wouldn’t leave the airport until she was safely in her car. We decided to drive back home in convoy due to the weather conditions & to ensure we both got home safely after a very stressful 24 hours of travels. I dropped my friend at the entrance to the car park & simply pulled over into a lay-by for 58 seconds & watched for her to exit the car park. Two days later a PCN notice arrived. There were no signs on this bay stating no stopping (& the photographs supplied on the PCN did not include such signage). The whole journey was extremely stressful, firstly a cancelled flight and the following one full that resulted in a drive to an airport we were unfamiliar with to catch another flight. We lost 8 hours of our 24 hour trip. We were made to feel extremely anxious at Doncaster airport check in as the tickets had not been transferred correctly. Then to be told we could not fly back to the same destination that meant our car was parked at the wrong destination. On return we had to arrange a pick up to get us home & then a further journey through blizzards to retrieve a car. Then I receive a PCN notice for pulling into a lay-by for 58 seconds to ensure my friends safety claiming I was in a no stopping zone that was not clearly marked. We attempted to claim a refund through Doncaster & Flybe for the additional petrol costs we incurred & the two lots of airport car parking we incurred due to a cancelled flight. The claim was declined. And then received several demands for £100 for less than one minute pull in where I didn't even stop the engine. I asked the airport to consider these mitigating circumstances & appealed this PCN notice. The car parking Operator refused to consider any mitigating circumstances & dismissed my appeal simply a further demand for £100 The stressful situation was purely brought on by Doncaster Airport / Leeds Bradford airport failure to transfer our flights … but they were simply not interested in any reimbursement of all the extra costs we incurred or supporting our appeal against the PCN.

Donetsk,airport,Janne Petersson,2010-04-19,"Arrived from Kiev rather late in evening. This airport is still very Soviet in many ways eg. it has very bad apron and terminal lighting and baggage claim is directly from luggage carts which can cause confusion if two flights arrive simultaneously (but don't worry the friendly airport security guys are there to help screaming at you in Russian when they suspect you walk toward the wrong cart). Other facilities also seem very basic and/or outdated and there is absolutely no information about transport to the city centre (not even a timetable!) so you may unfortunately find the unofficial ""taxi"" drivers your only alternative for going downtown. To be honest one of them gave me a very fair price and even gave me change upon arrival but I do not recommend ""inexperienced"" travellers to use these guys!

Douala,airport,Michael Powell,2016-12-11,"I arrived at, and left from Douala airport twice in two weeks. As Central African airports go it's not too bad. But if you are only used to big international airports it's not much fun. If you are arriving on an international flight, immigration takes for ever. They have a new system which involves having your photograph and fingerprints taken. Leaving on an international flight is also tiresome - you are continually asked to show your boarding card and passport as you pass along the corridors. Toilets are variable - some have running water, others don't. One big plus at the gate: passengers with oversized hand luggage were firmly told that it was going in the hold. Bravo! If you are travelling to Brussels, don't be alarmed to see your plane arrive and then leave very early. It's doing a quick hop to Yaoundé and then comes back. Check-in is a bit of a lottery. If you arrive too early you are refused access to the check-in area (which is air-conditioned, unlike the main areas). Arrive in a normal time frame and you could be in a long queue. For the uninitiated - your place in the queue is marked by where your luggage is, not where you are. Airport staff are generally unsmiling but not intimidating. A tip: there is an upstairs restaurant in the concourse. It's not bad at all and has a well air-conditioned section. However staff at the snack bar at the bottom of the stairs will tell you the restaurant is closed. Don't just believe them - go up and check. Another tip: if you have an internal flight on Camair, go straight to the office in the concourse and check that it is actually going to operate. It's not going to be a certainty.",Positive,Negative

She was exhausted and in pain and they kept her walking all the way through security and a little longer, before they managed to offer her a seat. They didn’t even offer her to sit down, when we waited for a car to pick her up. They just laughed when we kept telling them she needed a wheelchair and then they said that we were rude. They kept us without the possibility of getting something to drink or to go to the bathroom for two hours after getting of our plane. This is how they treat an elderly woman who is exhausted, in pain and dehydrated. They also split up families as only one can accompany a person who needs assistance. Even if they were just to walk and not going in a car. I have experienced rudeness and incompetence in other places but never both at the same time in such a degree. And it wasn’t only us. There were others, who weren’t offered a place to sit, when they really needed it.",Negative,Positive
Dubai World Central,airport,Frank Thomas,2022-11-07,"We were flying first class on Emirates. It took us almost 1hour of endless walking and elevators just to get to the immigration area for passport control. We queued for at least 45mins and then needed to continue walking to find Emirates desk to find our driver, who was not meeting us with our name sign. It took us around 2 hours to finally leave this airport!!!! Dreadful customer experience- Never again.

Dubai World Central,airport,H Simpson,2017-05-29,"It is envisaged, which in Dubai means it will happen, that Dubai World Central will be the principal airport in the Emirate. Presently, however, it has more in common with Bristol Airport circa. 1985 with only a few airlines regularly using the facility, most notably Qatar. Nevertheless, providing you have no interest in over-priced food - there is a McDonalds, Costa Coffee and a small restaurant - and (not) duty free shopping, DWC offers multiple advantages over Dubai's present main airport. Of note: the drop-off is immediately next to the terminal entrance - no long walk to check in, and no queues for immigration or security. One downside is the lengthy bus ride from the gate to the aircraft. Notwithstanding, with few aircraft, departure was fifteen minutes ahead of time. If using Qatar, why bother with the frantic DXB or creaking AUH.",Negative,Positive
Dubai World Central,airport,T Neyrinck,2016-09-03,"Used DWC to leave Dubai to Doha and beyond to Europe. Airport is a very long drive from Dubai's main hotels, unless you are staying in Dubai Marina or Jebel Ali, but also then a 40 min drive. The airport was virtually empty with only 4 flights leaving between 11pm and 7am. Oversized facilities, empty feeling, restaurant and duty free staff just sitting around and playing on their smartphones. Boarding is with buses from the terminal. Will avoid even if no queues, for me part of the travelling is the ""buzz"" of an airport.",Negative,Positive
Dublin,airport,John Dawson,2025-02-20,"We've used Dublin airport a fair number of times, and it has both positive and negative aspects. Passport control staff courteous. Nearly everyone friendly.

Trolleys unavailable far side of baggage drop / collect; no wheelchairs or child facilities either - Food & Drink poor; nowhere to get coffee / tea except in a paper cup; most food disappointing",Negative,Positive
Dubrovnik,airport,G Haywood,2024-09-30,Don’t really know where to start. First off the food is limited and is absolute garbage and way over priced. But the thing that really stands out are the staff ! Never in all my years of travelling have I come across such rude and arrogant people. The women on the desks at terminal are vile. Witnessed the one (we were delayed for 3 hrs so watched here this whole time) be so rude to a lot of people. Especially and old couple who nearly missed there flight due to the airport putting gate 20 on screen then changed it to gate 2 (where we where sat) at last minute. These 2 old people struggled to walk. And it’s a long way between the 2 gates. She did call there names quite a few times and once they got to gate 2 she was screaming and shouting at them like they where naughty children. Almost on the verge of bullying.  Once they had gone. She and the others at desk where what I believe to be cursing the old couple. Then laughing about it and very open about it. In the time we sat there we witnessed numerous times things like this happening to customers.,Negative,Positive
Dubrovnik,airport,Michael O'Connor,2024-06-24,"My wife put her Passport in the tray to pass through Security but it was missing at the other end. Staff looked, said it was missing and that there was nothing more they could do. Fortunately my wife has dual nationalities and we were able to use her other Passport to get a new Boarding Pass. We tried to report the loss to the Police but was told that we would have to leave the airport to do so. This would have meant missing our flight. Just before we got on the flight we were approached by a Policeman who said that the Passport had been found inside the scanner.",Negative,Positive
Dubrovnik,airport,1 reviewsE Lercen,2022-08-04,"Language barrier and extremely rude security staff. The airport was fairly small, clean and easy to find your way. I did not have to wait long in the queue. Both check in and other procedures ended very quickly to my surprise. Most of the staff at passport check and other parts of the airport seemed nice, but there was one terribly rude lady at the handbag check who -I assume - didn’t know English and therefore thought she could touch me without permission and grunt at me to express herself. There was one wooden mushroom that I bought for decoration purpose in one of my handbags and seemed suspicious to her on the x-ray, she first grunted and angrily pointed my bag. When I started to talk in English, she called her younger colleague to tell me that they have to check inside my bag. Its zip was broken so I had to sew it, so they said they needed to cut the bag open. I asked if they had bags to put my belongings or anything to sew it again, but at the end they cut it. While they were busy opening it, I was so panicked and confused, and I don’t know, I thought they were done checking my other luggages that were apparently waiting in line. When I attempted to walk towards my bags waiting on the conveyor belt, the same lady who didn’t know English raised her hand to push me back and yelled at me. And she and her younger colleague found the wooden mushroom and pulled it up from among my clothes only to look at each other and laugh. Let alone a simple apology, none of them showed any effort to make any explanation until I asked. And during the rest of my time, the lady spent her sweet time lifting the deodorants and some other liquids, which I forgot there, from my bags and grunting at me for each, as if I committed a crime. At least the younger lady tried to explain to me in English, but it was only when I asked a objected to or questioned the situation. I can understand that the security staff has to be very careful with the passengers and and are obliged to implement the rules – but this is not the way to do it. No one deserves this just because they are foreigners, it is important for all of us how to show respect to each other and communicate properly. And since it is a touristic destination, it should not be too much to ask the staff to know English.",Negative,Positive
Durban,airport,G Nishihira,2010-07-15,The new King Shaka airport is roomy airy and thoughtfully planned. There are a dozen or so retail outlets on the ground floor accessible to all and more retail outlets past security on the second floor where check-in occurs. There was an airport shuttle service connecting the airport to downtown Durban (and some coastal points along the way) that was reliable going into town but not coming back. Not sure if this is a regular service or if it was only during the World Cup.,Neutral,Positive
Durham/tees Valley,airport,Leo Enticknap,2012-04-03,Customer service has deteriorated significantly since my last trip in Jan. I arrived to catch KL1534 on 27 March 2012. Check-in agent said she could not tag my suitcase through to my final destination claiming that a routing of 4 flights cannot be printed on a single tag. I have taken many 4 flight journeys in the past with a single bag tag printed at the starting airport. I suspect that the real reason is that doing so involves some complication and that she just couldn't be bothered. The airside gents' toilet stank of sewage so badly it was impossible to set foot in there. Finally there was no priority boarding for Skyteam Elite members on the KLM flights: boarding was done by everyone stampeding for the gate queue as soon as the flight was called. If this airport wants to survive let alone continue charging passengers a £6 departure fee which its rivals in the region do not it needs to start running a much more professional operation.,Negative,Positive
Durham/tees Valley,airport,Leo Enticknap,2010-06-28,I flew from MME for the first time in almost a year largely because the cost of KLM tickets to a long haul destination have for some reason become more expensive than their equivalents from MAN. This time however there was only about a £60 difference between the MME-AMS-SEA-BUR flight compared to going from MAN and I thought that was worth paying for the convenience and absence of queues that MME offers. On the outward trip at least it was. Apart from the KLM flight I boarded there was almost no traffic at all (I get the impression the loss of charter and holiday flights due to the recession must have hit MME hard) and it remains one of the most stress-free airports I've ever used. There was one irritation. The Iceland volcano business started while I was away as a result of which my return was delayed by four days. While I was away I emailed MME telling them that my car would overstay its paid-in-advance booking in the airport car park asking them not to clamp it or have it towed away and asking if I'd be liable for any extra charge. Don't worry your car is safe and no extra charge came a very quick reply. However when I did return there were no airport staff around anywhere to get my ticket validated and I had to pay an extra £38 in the machine to get out of the car park. I later wrote to the airport enclosing the receipt and asking if they'd consider refunding me. It's now two months later and I've had no reply. Admittedly this is a very minor problem compared to the volcano disruption some people experienced but given that MME must be having real problems retaining routes and passengers (not surprising given how much the cost of KLM flights from the airport have gone up) I didn't find that very impressive; especially given that the volcano disruption would have meant fewer departing passengers and thus my car was not taking up a space that someone else would have wanted and been willing to pay for.,Negative,Positive
Dushanbe,airport,P Bedson,2010-06-02,Welcome back to the 1950s! Soviet era customer service and chaos. Dushanbe only has 2 flights a week from Istanbul (most flights are from Moscow) - if they had more the system would collapse. On arrival it took 3 hours to clear immigration - once I got my visa I had to wake up the border official to stamp my passport! Usual FSU customer service standards - it took 20 minutes from getting to the desk to receiving a boarding card with the check in agent calling her friends and wandering off during check in hand writing passenger details carry your own bag through the scanner etc. They relieved me of $40 exit charge for which I got no receipt so I am not sure if this was simply a bit of Tajik private enterprise or a tax on foreigners. Airside there is absolutely no space - the airport was designed before security measures and you simply have to wait until 5 minutes before the flight before you go through. Duty free closed (with only 2 flights of westerners a week you would think it was worth their while to open it) and nothing at all airside aside from a few plastic chairs. Land side there is a coffee shop selling bizzarely coloured cakes and a variety of beverages but as the Turkish Airlines flight is horribly early in the morning I did not feel up to consuming anything so cannot comment!,Negative,Positive

East Midlands,airport,E Bane,2023-10-26,"This has to be in the worst airport I've ever used in the UK and across the world for treatment by security staff I know there have a job to do but well their ability to deal with passengers is shockingly bad, I took my prescription medication in a separate clear bag with the labels on. As I had been instructed to do at another UK airport, being advised having the prescription labels matching my passport details would help the process. I may as well have been trying to take liquid cannabis instead of anti inflammatory creams. I was repeatedly asked for my paper prescription, I can only assume the staff haven't been ill for a number of years so have no idea the NHS has stopped issuing paper prescriptions; it's all done electronically. After the 10 minutes of interrogation with me finally getting the NHS app working to show them they were actually my prescriptions, I just wondered shouldn't there be more interested that my passport maybe false if it aligned to all the details on the prescription labels on my medicine? And they didn't believe a word of it. More interested in a little bottle of something bigger than you're allowed. Final indignation because they'd messed me around so much before the scanners, I then had a full body search going through. It is the last time I ever use this airport.",Positive,Negative

Edinburgh,airport,Alison Bathgate,2024-12-27,"Arrived at Edinburgh airport to fly with Ryanair for a 5.55am flight to Alicante. Chaos from start to finish. We checked in at one location then had to drop bags at a different location, which took 25 minutes. The queue to reach security was all the way outside and took 35 minutes to get up the escalator. When up stairs there were hundreds of people with no queue system in place where absolute chaos ensued. There was a lack of staff and systems in place to ensure a smooth transition and to make sure everyone caught their flight. I have never in over 50 years of travel witnessed anything so unorganised and absolute mayhem. We over heard a member of staff saying it takes 14 minutes to get through security' eventually after 45 minutes we asked a member of staff after showing our boarding passes were we hoping to miss our final call she let us skip a bit of the queue but we still had to queue and by the time we got through the security queue the flight had closed for boarding. The swissport staff stated the bus had departed to take passengers to the flight and we could not board despite the flight still waiting for take off. The member of staff was not helpful and directed us to Ryanair check in which we did to be told to go to the Swissport desk, who then told us to go back to Ryanair check in desk. We insisted on speaking to their manager who was helpful and we then had to go back to Ryanair check in who arranged a flight the next day for £100 pounds each. My partner and I had to book an airport hotel that night, this terrible experience cost over £400 more and we lost 2 days from our holiday. My advice is avoid Edinburgh airport if possible, there are too many early morning flights which they are unable to accommodate due to staffing and chaotic systems in place. Shocking service and staff ranged from very helpful to incompetent and those who simply did not care and were uninterested.",Negative,Positive

Eindhoven,airport,I Bakker,2022-10-19,"Extremely disappointing and disorganized airport! This is the first airport I have seen where the security check queue starts outside of the airport! Usual waiting time before you can reach the security check turns out to be at least 2 hours, no matter what day and time you are travelling (found out from the people around me in the line, as we had the chance to become best friends during these hours standing together). At the same time there were 4 security check lines that actually worked out of 8 in total? There are two older women, who have been appointed with the task to go back and forth the gigantic queue, again, starting outside of the airport, and yell out people for the next flights.. Of course they do that in Dutch and barely speak English when you ask them any kind of a question. The reason why they have these women is that, on top of all, this is a ""silent"" airport, which means that you don't get any information whatsoever. I am wondering who decided that this airport can support all the flights that are scheduled (usually about 6-7 departures per hour) when the capacity is suited for less than a third of that. (At least with all the accumulated revenue from this overscheduling, the airport could have invested in reorganizing and/or working with full staff and capacity all the time, again, not the case!) Overall: Very bad experience, extremely long queues, unfriendly and solely Dutch-speaking staff, extremely bad management.

El Paso,airport,Steven Dratler,2013-03-13,This airport was a small typical airport for a city of this size but it seems to be really under used. Very little planes are seen taking off or landing when driving by this airport. The terminal is quiet and peaceful so don't arrive too early. Overall a pleasant experience. The only problem I had is how there is no shade at the curbside area so be warned about that. Other than that I don't have much to complain about.,Negative,Positive
Ende,airport,B Vincent,2013-07-20,A new terminal has been built but was not yet open so I used the old facilities. Arrivals area was a simple open-sided area of the main building. Check-in took place in a single room at the other end of the building. At the x-ray scanner an operator gazed in the general direction of the monitor screen. The main hall had no AC not even a fan and had a very oppressive atmosphere. Baggage handlers man-handled checked bags out through a back door. After checking in most passengers seemed to go back outside where it was much cooler. The waiting lounge had decent seating some air-conditioning unappealing bathrooms and no shops - it was quite full as there were two flights departing. Flying from Ende was an interesting experience but I think the new terminal will remove a lot of what makes it special.,Negative,Positive
Enfidha-hammamet,airport,S Vali,2024-03-27,"Clean, spacious airport in March. WiFi is available, although the signal is weak. Upon arrival you have to queue for longer than necessary (a simple passport check should not take long). Upon departure, there is no online check-in. All passengers must check-in at the counter, even those with only hand/cabin luggage.  I guess the airport (run by TAV) has not upgraded its systems for many years.  There are too many security checks.  Food and drinks are very expensive on the airside, and there are no water fountains. This is extortion.",Negative,Positive
Enfidha-hammamet,airport,A Martin,2015-06-17,"By far the worst airport experience I have ever had. Yes it is clean, new and modern but these were the only good things about it. There were at least 12 flights within the space of an hour and then nothing for the next 3 or 4 hours, the result, total chaos! I think there were literally 5 or so security lanes serving what would have been probably 2,500 passengers in an hour. We got to the airport about 2 and a half hours before departure and queued for almost 2 hours to get through security! Some people were panicking and trying to jump the queue as their flights were being called, but rightly so the passengers near the front stopped them. It's the only time I've ever had to run for a flight in my life. Turned out they were still missing over 50 passengers on the flight as they were still stuck in the terminal. Consequently Thomas Cook had to delay the flight. The airport shouldn't allow so many flights to go at once if it's totally incapable of handling them all. If you somehow manage to go at a quiet time though I'm sure it would be a very nice airport!",Negative,Positive

Ercan,airport,C Murray,2006-01-11,"A very clean airport but with often absent and very rude staff - a trait that we now know to be common in Turkey and Turkish Cyprus. There is a great lack of any English signage or translations of announcements. Hardly qualifies as an ""international"" airport on that score. On arrival we had no idea which of the bits of paper we had to fill in to avoid the stamp in our passports and on departure we sat ourselves by the gates and watched faces that we knew were to be on our flight so we wouldn't be likely to miss the plane. The duty free is very strange in Ercan - instead of a large shop selling everything there are loads of little shops all selling much the same thing. Despite Turkey and TRNC still having their own currency and being very keen to get their hands on Sterling and US Dollars the prices are all in Euros although mostly there are no prices on anything and you have to ask. This maked it very hard to compare between the various shops. And you also fall foul of a sneaky trick - you never get a price quoted in Turkish Lira - they tell you what it is in your own currency but what you don't realise is that they have converted it using the bank rate which is not at all favourable. Never use your credit card in Turkish Cyprus because they also charge extra and by the time you see the amount on your statement it's likely to be a fair bit more than you thought!! Having said that though if it's alcohol and tobacco you are after the prices are very cheap and even better than in the normal shops. One further warning - beware of the luggage trolleys!! They all work perfectly no wobbly wheels etc. but they give you an electric shock when you start moving them. Heaven knows what is in wheels or in the floor covering but I got a shock on arrival and again on departure. A fellow traveller told us that it happens a lot.",Negative,Positive
Exeter,airport,J Morgan,2024-08-04,"Exeter used to be a first class friendly efficient and welcoming place. In fact, I went out of my way to use it. Nothing could be further from the truth now! The check -in staff are rude, insulting and ill informed. The security staff could get an award for being the most obstreperous, rude and difficult to grace an airport. They are also wrong on so many counts and semm to enjoy being wrong whilst flexing muscles that they would be unable to do anywhere else. The airport seems to attract jobs worths and is run by a poorly qualified manager who seems to be operating above his ability levels. Many staff in departures, the lounge and duty free ask for travellers to complain formally as they hear so many complaints and there is nothing they can do about it. As they say, they want to protect their jobs and that can't be done if passengers are cross and irritable, not spending money and not using the airport. I actively use Bristol now. That is hardly an example of great practice but at least it is anonymous and busy! Exeter needs custom and it does not go the right way of achieving this goal. I would strongly suggest that the Manager is re-trained and/or the staff are trained at other busy airports where customer service is paramount.",Positive,Negative

Exeter,airport,Graham Woods,2021-08-30,"I was booked to travel Club Europe from this airport on 21st August 2021. No dedicated check-in, no priority security, no business lounge. I managed to find a quiet place to sit upstairs in the bar area (the outside seating area was closed). After about 30 minutes an airport employee entered the bar area to inform all of us who were seated there, that the area should have been cordoned off and that we had to move downstairs. Apparently, this was because the floor was unstable. We were told there were plenty of seats at the bottom of the stairs so we went downstairs to sit - which was directly underneath the unstable floor! Very odd - and very dangerous I would have thought. I got the distinct impression that the jobsworth employee just did not want to patrol the upstairs area, so he moved us all downstairs. Because of the danger of the upstairs floor caving in on us we all moved to the main seating area in a windowless room which was extremely busy and required some considerable searching to find empty seats. The area soon became very busy without a seat to be had. All those people sitting so close to each other in a room without a window and all I could think about was Social Distancing. Before long my flight was called and I moved to the boarding gate, Here we all waited whilst the ground staff went into overdrive because they spotted an elderly woman who was reliant on oxygen - and who had a tank strapped to her back. I overheard the member of staff ask of another about how the lady got through check in and security without being challenged about her oxygen. I too questioned this and wondered how easy it would be for a terrorist to get through the airport. This thought soon dissipated when a door suddenly opened and an airport employee shouted 'They're ready for you now' - at which point there was a mad rush for the door. We are all so used to polite announcements made over the tannoy, that to have someone open a door and shout an instruction was quite refreshing - not! In all, a shambles from start to finish. I don't think I have ever been through such an unprofessional airport in my life. And I've been through many airports in some of the most back of beyond places in the world.",Negative,Positive

Fes-Saïss,airport,H Smith,2019-06-17,"This airport is one of the most weirdly inept airports I have ever been to, even for a 3rd world country. The Moroccan style cafe we waited in initially, in the main airport lounge pre-security check was open but completely un-staffed for a couple of hours until finally, they closed. What's up with that? Then, at the security check in they took from me, and tossed, my silver plated, miniature forks that I had bought as souvenirs, as well as a miniature metal fork that I got on a Lufthansa flight, on the plane, all of these, had prongs no longer than 1.5cm, when up to 6cm are allowed, and I have previously passed through at least 50 airport security checks all over the world without any problem, with my metal Lufthansa fork, last time as recently as a week ago on my way to Fez. Clearly, their security staff are ill-informed and need retraining. Inside the departures waiting area, despite being in Morocco, all the prices were shown only in euros, which makes no sense, since this isn't even Europe, but Africa. This made it really hard what to choose in order to spend the maximum of my last Dirhams. For the boarding then, even though the big screen would read ""boarding open"", it didn't provide a gate number, and the guy staffing one of the gates didn't know, either. If he doesn't know, who would? Bizarre experience, overall.",Positive,Negative
Florence,airport,10 reviewsB Anderson,2023-06-16,"Not often I have felt so embarrassed as a Florentine living abroad on how my city welcomes its visitors. The luggage collection is a pain (as with most Italian airports, and not only), but the worse is the indifferent and arrogant attitude of the people working there. To top it all is the transfer from the Terminal (tiny and overcrowded) to the car rental. It is a couple of meters, but cannot be reached by foot (especially not with heavy luggage) and therefore there is a shuttle. Instead of driving in a loop, one waits and waits and waits till finally the driver shows up, with cellphone in his hands while driving. While the meanwhile accumulated masses of people try to squeeze in the tiny bus, unapologetically the driver continues the phone conversation and lights up a cigarette. Even when after 30 seconds the bus is filled with people eager to finally move on, the departure for the 2 mins ride is after the driver finishes his cigarette. Don’t think the option of taking a taxi is any better, 2 out of the 3 times it takes an hour to get one as the line is horribly long: if you must be in the centre, take the tram-connection (it costs 1,50 € and takes 20 mins). I have traveled through the whole world, and Florence Airport definitely is in the top ten of the worst.",Negative,Positive

The customer service attendants that day were a nightmare they hate doing their jobs. I simply asked for a phone booth and a man pointed to the right and told me there was one over there with no directions. I came back and he was gone. It was only to get me to leave.. no type of humanity or empathy. My flight also left even though we were there extremely early like six hours before our flight because they didnt have enough people for covid testing. But there was this one security girl officer who was so sweet to me I even told her god bless you because she helped me by giving me saran wrap when my suitcase burst open.

Florence,airport,Christopher Lawton,2022-06-06,"So I write this review mainly as some form of coping with the situation my family is in. We flew into Florence airport 3 days ago. Our luggage was no where to be found. The lost and found office was an absolute joke, under staffed and fairly rude. We were given some paperwork with a promise of a text updating the progress of finding my family’s luggage. Three days later, we have received zero communication. You can’t call because it is apparently open for call for 1 hour a day. Our routine is to Drive to the airport and wait in line with 40 to 50 people with one person trying to help them. We did find 4 of the 7 bags. We are still missing my father in laws heart medicine. When we mentioned the urgency of that situation, the person told him to go to a doctor here. We have been looking forward to this vacation for about a year and it is now ruined by shear laziness and incompetence. We have found out that not one person on our flight from Chicago to Florence got their luggage the day they landed. Please do not use this airport. It is completely unprofessional and a complete disaster.",Negative,Positive

Fort Lauderdale,airport,Josué Gallegos,2023-11-08,"Our flight arrived on time, but the airport was unable to receive the plane. We had sit again and wait in the plane. Then, they told us that they had no resources to unload the baggages from the plane and we had to wait another hour. Finally, there are way more travelers than what the customs could manage and we had to wait in the side and then we were moved to the line. Because of that we lost our connecting flight. We had 3 hours between arrival and departure which is normally more than enough for a so small airport. The airport is accepting much more flight than they can manage and the customers are who suffer only. The airport attendants did not care at all. In consequence we had to stay the night at the airport outside the security area with nothing to eat and no where comfortable where to seat. They were not willing to lay anything because they said it was a “uncontrollable” situation. We booked the flight a month ago so they knew how many flights were arriving, it was not an uncontrollable surprise.

Fort Lauderdale,airport,Omar Martinez,2023-04-13,"Avoid Ft Lauderdale Airport like the plague. I would give this airport negative 5 stars. I had a flight out of Ft Lauderdale today to Cancun to celebrate my 50th birthday with a large group of close friends in Tulum. It’s been raining in all of south Florida for past three days, and due to this, Ft. Lauderdale Airport has closed for the past two days including today. I can understand weather being a major issue resulting in airport closures, but somehow Ft Lauderdale airport is the only airport that has closed. They are currently close and ironically it’s been sunny all day. All of my friends were able to fly out of Miami International Airport which is a 30 minute drive to the south and somehow Miami International did not close at all. And Miami is extremely prone to flooding as it’s lower than Ft. Lauderdale. West Palm Beach airport which is just to the north did not close either. So needless to say, all of my friends are celebrating my 50th in Tulum without me because the airport will not open till tomorrow with the airline not being able to book me another flight for next three days. Worst part is as we are all sitting in the airport waiting for some news, airport staff had no idea what was going on or when they would reopen. I will never fly out of there, heaven forbid it rains a little again and the airport is shut down for a week. What did Miami and West Palm Beach airports figure out what to do that Ft.

The security guards screamed at my entire family (we had children with us!) telling us we should have been there sooner, you were late."" They have done this to every professional friend we have.

Frankfurt Hahn,airport,L Rossi,2023-11-06,"I never faced in my traveler years what happened yesterday in this airport in Europe. Staff at the gates created a chaos at the control because of cosmetics not in the plastic bag of their choice, obliging people to buy it in a nearest shop or throw it away. Information was displayed on a little monitor not easily readable by all. There were three flights leaving and all left delayed because of this. Staff lacking in common sense, blinded by the rules (even correct), excessive in personal control without good reasons. All these in the name of the safety? Why nobody asked us for an identity card? This is not the correct procedure, I think. They should ask for it together with the boarding pass or not? Identity is not important? Any criminal can embark and what matters is to have the cosmetics in the plastic bag of their choice? So, in my opinion to switch from the Frankfurt Main one is the right choice.

The bus takes the longest way possible to get to the terminal building. On arrival, a long series of escalators and confusing signs to get to the passport control. After that, several signs showed two options in opposite directions to reach Terminal 1, with many folk looking very lost.  Trying to reach Terminal 1, I headed for the overhead monorail service, using 2 escalators taking perhaps 10 minutes. At the entrance to the platform, barriers with a notice: ""closed"".

Freetown,airport,Dave Stanley,2005-04-02,Back again at the end of March. This time not such a good experience. On the way in baggage was late because the handlers could not be bothered to do their job. On the return we suffered a very long wait in the extremely hot entrance hall. This is caused by the very slow and beauracratic check in procedures. The air conditioning in the main part of the airport is proving totally inadequate and many units do not work. Some of the staff are quite unhelpful. Sierra Leone needs tourism but no respectable tour company would let their customers suffer this.,Negative,Positive
Freetown,airport,Francis Ellis,2004-04-14,Freetown Lungi International Airport is a small airport terminal building. It recieves very few flights the majority being international.

Friedrichshafen,airport,Nick Wilcock,2006-04-01,FDH is an airport I use quite often and it is generally fine.

But since LH Regional have taken over the service there are only 3 flights per day each way whose reliability timing and frequency are woeful.,Negative,Positive
Friedrichshafen,airport,Max Heathcote-Smith,2006-01-29,A typical Ryanair airport. Small and miles from anywhere (although perhaps suitable for the Alps and skiing access or unless you have relatives nearby!) However it meant that from the plane to the car hire desk was about 50 metres and we were on our way less than 20 minutes after landing. If you need a train the station is literally 30 metres from the terminal door. It's not an architectural gem the seating is limited and hard but it has a cafe and a shop and it's efficient and has what you need. The staff were friendly and allowed us to board first on our return to the UK as my wife had a broken hand in plaster. As long as the plane is on time it does the job well,Positive,Negative

She said if he needs special assistance he needs to sit in a wheelchair otherwise she is going to cancel it. I tried to explain to her that he is fine without a wheelchair but she kept repeating herself not accepting any other answer. My son started to get very anxious and nervous because he thought he needs to be taken to hospital by using wheelchair and finally she said if he doesn’t want using wheelchair chair he isn’t disabled person. Does she have the medical education to comment on this?  I tried to stay calm because my son was stressful enough so I didn’t want make him more feeling stressed, anyway she cancelled special assistance for him.

Fuerteventura,airport,E Barten,2022-10-28,"I am a non ambulatory wheelchair user, accompanied by my husband. After prompt check in, I was obliged to wait at least 20 minutes with other disabled, before being guided to another place in departures. I was told that I would be contacted at this point, at least half an hour before departure. We went immediately to a refreshment area to buy a much needed coffee, but were sought out by an attendant who told us that we need to be at the departure gate. I told the attendant that I must first use the disabled toilet, and was pressured by him that I needed to be quick. What a joke. I have never been in such a badly equipped disabled toilet, and discovered to my horror that there were no fixed grab rails to help me stand, to pull myself together. Only one wobbly drop rail. I opened the toilet door, knowing that I could pull myself up, using the door frame. Fortunately a lovely attendant was there, and realising my dilemma, she helped me to pull myself together. I have never been so mortified in my life, but she was very sweet. The impatient attendant was waiting for me in the public area. On the verge of tears, my husband calmed me, as we followed the attendant to the departure gate, where we waited for another 20 minutes. It the door of the airplane, I was transferred to a small loading chair and was dragged on board amongst the confusion with other walking passengers.

Fuerteventura,airport,J James,2019-02-18,"The special assistance was terrible. On arrival the footplate to our special needs buggy did not come off the plane with the rest of the buggy.

We waited for over half an hour, until we had to leave to get our transport to our hotel, and it never arrived. It was reported but it never turned up. That’s £30 to buy a replacement. Departure was a joke. Having a priority sticker on our luggage meant nothing. We got to go to the front of the queue and to go down to the plane first. However everyone else was immediately allowed to follow us down and as we had the buggy and needed to wait for the lift, by the time we got down to where the shuttle was, dozens of people were now in front of us. An inept member of staff told us not to board the transport, that we would be getting on a different vehicle. Everyone else boarded the transport then he told us to get on it and we were driven out to the plane. There were no members of staff by the stairs! We had to walk up the stairs carrying our hand luggage, a special needs buggy and our 12 year old disabled daughter. The cabin staff then told us that we shouldn’t have boarded that way, that a special transport should have brought us directly to the door. Well, yes it should but it didn’t and it was incredibly frustrating and depressing to have been dumped at the bottom of the steps like that. Have to admit that we won’t be in any hurry to go to Fuerteventura again.",Positive,Negative

Fukuoka,airport,T Johnson,2017-05-25,Compared to NRT / HND / KIX this airport is left lacking. It is small so should have been an easy one to transfer in but with very little time one had to get out of the domestic terminal and wait for a bus ride to take you to the international terminal. After some 15 minutes ride you get there and it was quite difficult to figure out where to go. Finally getting to departures you had to queue for a long time for both security scanning and passport control. The staff were very rude unlike elsewhere in Japan where one always gets a great welcome. They tried to pull the basket away before I had even put everything in it. No hello. After enduring the rudeness you had the very slow passport check queue which took forever. Left no time for shopping or enjoying the terminal. Grabbing a few items in panic I got to the gate. There was still just the call to go to the gate but for some reason I heard my name called on the tannoy. I presented myself. The gate staff offered no explanation nor smiles looking at my boarding pass and then handing it back to me. It was most odd. The up shot is if you are using FUK make sure you have a lot of time and don't expect the usual Japanese manners. Certainly made this traveler feel most unwelcome.,Negative,Positive
Funchal,airport,C Dunnell-Barber,2024-12-27,Google flights told me that our flight was delayed by 2.5 hours before I arrived at the airport. On arrival we checked with airport staff and they confirmed the flight status was fine. The signs sent us to our boarding gate which meant going through passport control. On arrival at the gate they have not opened it and so nobody is able to sit down. After waiting 30 minutes there is an announcement that our flight is delayed by 1 hour and 55 minutes (just under the 2 hour mark which would entitle us to food and drinks). Google flights still says that our 2:35 flight to Stansted will not be leaving until 4:55. The gate has still not been opened. Very few passengers can sit down. Elderly passengers are standing up in a queue for an unknown amount of time. None of us are able to get back up to the airport where we could by food and drinks. The airport signs still do not show that the flight is delayed therefore passengers will still be being sent down here without warning that they will be trapped.

No problem, I’ve done this many times before. When picking up the hire car at Funchal airport I needed to access the cabin cases only to find my combination lock numbers had been changed. The hire car reps managed to open the one case but the lock on the other had to be broken open. Apparently this is not unusual at Funchal, this was the fifth time they had experienced it.

Gdansk,airport,2 reviewsPaddy Putland,2023-09-30,"I am partially disabled with restricted mobility. I have metal in my leg and hip following reconstructive surgery.

Noting some airports adjust the sensitivity of these detectors. So, back to the Gdańsk experience. Having detected the archway, I am directed to remove my footwear. My trainers are cloth/plastic, no metal. This is the default situation and very annoying. It is obviously not my shoes that cause the alarm. Of course there are no aids, by example a chair, and I am forced to comply or no fly! So, no shoes, but despite my explanations I again alert the archway. I did tell you that would happen - me to the suspicious security person - now a physical search. Remember I am partially disabled. Stand on one leg and show me your sole! I’m +60 years of age and there is no standing support aid. I am then very roughly treated by a security thug who has the compassion and intellect of a slug.

We walked up to the airport staff and I handed him all four passports with boarding passes for inspection. This airport staff spoke Korean to me. Me being Chinese, I told him I do not speak Korean.

This person repeated what he said in an even ruder tone toward my wife. At this point, I am extremely frustrated and I said to this person and I asked him if he spoke English. He ignored me and continued to address my wife in a disdainful manner. After a few exchanges, She found out that this airport staff does not speak any English and each passenger had to hold his/her own passport and boarding pass. This airport staff then inspected our passports and boarding passes in the most foul mood, without once apologizing to my wife nor me, and sent us through. Having the name Gimhae ""International"" Airport, I would assume that the first airport staff personnel any passenger meet would have the basic understanding of English. Isn't it his/her job to make passengers welcomed, greet them with courtesy and respect? I did not see or experience any of that at Gimhae ""International"" Airport. Gimhae should consider revising/updating its basic requirements when hiring staff. I believe each staff should at least know the English phrase to be able to perform his/her job properly, or maybe I'm expecting too much from Gimhae ""International"" Airport. Another thing is that there was no signage advising each passenger must pass on their own passport and boarding pass (even toddlers) for inspection. My family and I have been to many airports around and have never encountered this. After this incident, I have concluded that Gimhae ""International"" Airport is not a family friendly place.",Negative,Positive

There is no shopping options except two cafes at the airport, one in the departure and the other in the arrival. There is a spacious parking lot and a couple of car rental kiosks.

Glasgow,airport,Peter Loni,2024-01-05,What an absolute ripoff. Why are we allowing companies to rob us like this.

This £10 gives a customer absolutely nothing. High time that people protested on their doorstop.

After 2 hours sitting on the plane we were informed that fog had lifted & we were to fly back.......plane engine would not start! they were sending an engineer from Glasgow to look at the problem. 3 hours later we were to to disembark into the departure lounge (300 people) after 2 hours we were told to stand in a queue for a £15 food voucher? most people had already paid for a breakfast. The queue was 300 out of the restaurant as only 2 people serving. as My wife is in a wheelchair & I'm 77 I could not stand in line for over an hour I still have my 2 x £15 vouchers!

Departing was OK, but arrival, around 1am was just what was not needed after a delayed 3 hour flight from Malaga with ~200 exhausted passengers to be met by only 2 security persons on entry. I should add at this stage that I am slightly disabled at present as I am recovering from a replacement ankle operation, so have to use a stick to get around. Also, as my case had been damaged by Ryanair in transit I could not wheel it along so had to use a trolley to get it to Car Park 3. As there was an excalator to get up to the bridge and over to the car park, I enquired of 'Information' how I might get my trolley to the car park. They kindly showed me to a lift which took me up a floor and then along to the top of the escalator where I was met with a notice which declared, trolleys no further! Really helpful! So from there I had to carry my suitcase over the bridge, down the stairs to the station, along the platform, out and down the path to the car park and finally struggle to get it to my parked car, by which time I was absolutely shattered, a real welcome home. I doubt I'll ever use Prestwick again.",Negative,Positive

It's one thing to ensure the safety of passengers, but it's entirely another to subject personal items to repeated and excessive scans without a valid reason. I understand the importance of security measures, but there needs to be a balance between safety and respect for passengers' belongings. The staff's lackadaisical attitude and disregard for my concerns left a sour taste in my mouth (quite literally, considering my irradiated snacks).

Gran Canaria,airport,Mark Medcalf,2021-11-17,"After reading several negative reviews on this page regarding LPA Gran Canaria airport I wish to make a defence. I find the airport similar to many of the Spanish airports operated by Aena in that it handles the volume of passengers proportionately and professionally. Bear in mind the vast majority of passengers passing through the airport are there for leisure purposes, this has always been a difficult balancing act to please the foot traffic. Knowledge and pre-planning are the key to success. Informative information can be found online about the airport, for example https://gran-canaria-airport.com/ is just one example. Especially in this day and age with covid and the uncertainly about travel with changing restrictions, it is paramount that planning ahead to provide a heads up of potential problems and issues is a must.",Negative,Positive
Gran Canaria,airport,B Andrews,2017-11-25,"What appalling service! Jet2 had everything sorted, boarding was on time, but the airport had other ideas, 30 minutes wait to provide a bus to the plane, and frankly we could have walked a lot faster, then further delays while that bus emptied and returned as there only appeared to be one! They they had the cheek to tell our pilot that as they had made us miss our slot they were pushing our flight time back by over two hours! After a great deal of complaining we were told we might be able to go sooner, but currently are still sat on the aeroplane with no signs of any movement. We always go to Tenerife and this was a change, the hotel was lovely, we said we would return but now I’m not sure. Lots of other poor reviews on here about the airport, Gran Canaria you need to do better. Not to mention that you probably cost the airline many thousands with your lack of buses/drivers and we are still in danger of losing our crew if they go over time.

Greater Binghamton,airport,J Nedlik,2010-09-02,Had an ok trip using Binghamton Regional Airport - flew from Binghamton to Las Vegas with one layover in Philadelphia. The morning started off rough with a half hour delay to Philadelphia and when we did finally board the plane the grounds crew had to de-ice the aircrafts wings taking another 45 minutes (this is the one April when it was very cold). Had a rough flight to Philadelphia on a Dhc turboprop however the flight attendant was kind enough to announce all departures in the next 30 minutes (of course Las Vegas being one of them) and asked if the passengers would let the people with earliest departures to be let off first. By the time we got off the plane and into the main terminal there was only 20 minutes left and we had to make it to terminal c from terminal f which is a long hike. We were told that we would be better off not taking the bus over to the other terminal so my family of four 2 being young children had to run halfway across the airport. Making it to the terminal in a half hour we were sure we missed our flight however my business company planned the flight and notified the staff that passengers would be arriving late and they held the plane for us. The plane to Las Vegas was a 757 and it is particularly long and of course our seats were in the back so we had all eyes on us as we walked to the back. The flight to Las Vegas was quick and we are very happy with us airways but not with Philadelphia or Binghamton airports as Philadelphia is not easy to transfer terminals and the half hour delay in Binghamton could have been used to de-ice the plane saving time.,Negative,Positive
Greater Rochester,airport,W Burke,2010-06-30,This is my home airport. Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised. I had the entire security checkpoint to myself no other passengers ! This was incredibly lucky on my part. There are no VIP or First class lounges here. Rochester is a place people arrive at or depart from there are virtually no layovers here. This is not an overly busy airport. Taxi times are short and the runway never gets stacked up. I heartily endorse the Red Osier's Prime Rib Sandwiches shop airside too. The only drawback in my opinion is a dearth of ground transportation options taxi rent a car or RTS bus. RTS busses don't run very often and travel through one of the worst neighborhoods in the city on their way downtown.,Negative,Positive

Greenville–Spartanburg,airport,7 reviewsBill Holmes,2016-06-09,"Greenville-Spartanburg (GSP) is a regional airport in northwestern South Carolina. It gets its ""international"" name from its customs clearance facility for air freight to serve the 175 foreign companies with operations in the region, it has no international passenger flight (although its 11,000 foot runway could handle them). Greenville, SC has become one of the most dynamic small cities in the US and the airport is finally upgrading to reflect this change of status. Immediate inconvenience comes from a major construction project to upgrade facilities. Boarding areas are comfortable even though services are fairly basic. Baggage claim is very convenient. Outside pick-up and drop-off areas are being improved but can be somewhat cramped at present.

Grenoble,airport,Nikolay Rekov,2023-03-25,"The worst airport ever! I had to fly from Grenoble Airport because my flight from Lyon Airport was cancelled and this was the only option available going back to Gatwick at the same date, due to French workers strike action! I carried snow chains for my car, because I drove in the French Alps at high above 2000m, where according to French government you have to have winter tires or snow chains for your car! I carried my snow chains because the rental car company didn't provide winter tires and the snow chains for 10 days was £100 extra. I took my own snow chains, I had no problem taking them in my hand bag from Gatwick, going through Lyon Airport arriving in France. Neither UK border on departure nor British Airways had any problems with me carrying them in my hand luggage because they are only 2.5kg weight and fit into my back pack. However, upon departure from Grenoble, very rude lady at security check confiscated the snow chains with the argument that she doesn't allow these on board, also she stated that Grenoble airport doesn't allow snow chains too. When I asked to show me proof where this was stated and I showed my previous tickets that I flew with them in my back pack, she said if I don't sign the paper that they are confiscating the chains, I will not fly, she took my passport and my phone with my boarding pass!

There are two or three restaurants selling Chinese food where none of the staff speak English and communication is hard but they do try to help you. There is one coffee place and a Starbucks far away near A gate. Wifi is patchy and you have to register your passport on a machine before you can access wifi.

Why it was not noted on my pass is another concern of mine. How is anyone supposedly to know where to board? The clerk knew which gate I was supposed to go to but when I asked she just kept staring at her screen. There were two attendants there but the other was helping another passenger. I even waited about 2 minutes for her to respond. I asked her again and she just ignored me. My wife then caught up and had to literally tap her screen to get her attention. And then with an angry attitude she answered our question. All she had to do was politely ask me to wait until she had a moment to help. This attitude with staff at this airport is common.

Guernsey,airport,Andrew Blagrove,2022-01-21,"I am a resident of Alderney and use Guernsey airport on a regular basis. The customer service provided by G4S (security staff) is non existent. Every opportunity to make your journey swift and courteous whilst carrying out these very important duties seemed totally irrelevant to the staff on duty today (20/01/22). I was travelling with my mother in law who was in a wheelchair after having surgery. The amount of undressing and unpacking of hand baggage was totally unacceptable. After extra body searches with an ever increasing queue of people I retrieved our belongings and started to re pack and get dressed. Unfortunately my mother in law had left some small liquid bottles in her bag. Understandably the items had to be checked. I apologised but was met with a stern look and rather than rescanning the bag had it completely emptied and re searched. I was not alone. This was happening to many others. 2 flights were departing at the same time in an otherwise empty airport. There was no urgency or friendliness. Someone near me said that they felt very intimidated and like they were in Russia! Whilst I have no problem with tight security checks I do have a problem with the lack of customer service. This is a consistent problem whilst leaving Guernsey. I dread going through every time. Why is it such a problem. You’re innocent until proven guilty unless travelling through Guernsey airport! In my opinion the worst experience of anywhere that I have travelled through. I am retired BA cabin crew. In this review I put “no, I wouldn’t recommend this airport” but that’s such a shame because service throughout the Island is fantastic and no way reflects the island of Guernsey.",Negative,Positive

Haikou,airport,K Chen,2008-03-14,Haikou Airport is not too bad but the toilet facilities are a bit dirty. They do not provide toilet paper on the toilets so you'll need to get some paper from the paper towel supply next to the toilets. Check-in gates don't seem to be crowded at all. When I got to security I thought it would take quite long but it had been really fast; 2 minutes to scan my hand luggage. After security there is a cafe bar located before you enter onto the terminal. Now this is where it gets hectic. You simply cannot breathe while you're trying to capture a picture of a plane on the tarmac. The people just smoke and smoke and basically you could just see everyone smoking in the bar. When I approach the toilets in the waiting hall I see them as third class squat toilets. They are so dirty and no one seems to clean them with detergent. This is what is hectic for foreigners but I am Chinese so I would understand this. The waiting hall showing departures do not have English read on them so you have to understand a bit of Chinese to get through the airport as efficiently as you can.,Positive,Negative

While bus gate arrivals/departures were the exception then, it has become too frequent in recent years. I am flying through Doha about 6 times a year, more than half of my flights in 2023 were remote bus transfers. The departures via bus gate are particularly stressful with very limited seating, unorganized boarding and stressed gate agents. The picture shows my latest bus gate departure with crowded areas and inadequate seating.",Negative,Positive
Hamburg,airport,L Souza,2023-06-17,"I travel frequently on business. From the experiences I had in my life, I must say Hamburg Airport is by far, the worst I had the displeasure of using. I live in Hamburg, so I am frequently using the services of this airport, unfortunately and it is rarely a smooth experience. Today I had the worst experience ever: After luggage drop-off I had to wait for more than 90 min in the security queue. There was nothing special this day, it was just another normal Saturday. Later, when I was already inside the plane, all passengers already on-board 5 minutes before the schedule, my plane was grounded for another 60 minutes. The reason? The airport staff took ""too long"" loading the luggage in the aircraft. The pilot had to call a representative of airport staff inside the craft to ask what exactly was delaying so much the work of the loaders. TLDR: If you don't like huge waiting times and having your flight delayed for absolutely no reason, stay away from this Hamburg Airport (HAM).",Negative,Positive
Hamburg Lubek,airport,A Hazemi,2008-06-27,Been flying through LBC several times with destinations such as Dublin and London Stansted. I have encountered only once uncomfortable experience with Ryanair flight to Dublin being delayed for almost 6 hours. Thanks to the Eu new regulation I received a voucher for a small meal at the LBC restaurant. LBC is easily accessible from Hamburg City with the direct bus service. The airport condition improved somehow. A new duty free zone has been up and provides wide selection of goods especially perfumes. Unfortunately it is located in the departure hall just behind the security control.,Positive,Negative
Hamburg Lubek,airport,Sabina Sanziot,2008-06-20,I've flown to and from Hamburg-Lübeck with Ryanair on many occasions (Skavsta and Stansted) and as long as you know what you're getting yourself into when you book it's fine. This is a very much a basic flat-pack airport  but the bus to Hamburg takes about an hour for €8 a pop and deposits you right next to the main railway station so frankly - especially as Ryanair airports go - it's perfectly reasonable. If something goes wrong and you're stranded here all day then naturally you'll start to tear your hair out after a while but - occasional expansions and temporary chipboard flooring aside - it's hard to argue with the place when you're paying beer money for your flight.,Negative,Positive
Hamburg Lubek,airport,Scott Allison,2005-03-14,I agree with the other comments the airport is fine. Small and compact but with a reasonable range of facilities. However the contracted-out airport security staff are extremely strict in enforcing Ryanair's maximum baggage weights and dimensions - no leeway whatsoever!! There were a lot of very angry passengers who were told after they had already checked in their hold baggage they would have to check in their hand baggage into the hold as well - for example because the wheels of the bag took it over the permitted dimensions. It's maybe because these security staff are working for a private company instead of the airport or the airline they are so strict. Wireless LAN internet access available at 5 EURO per hour in the departure lounge.,Positive,Negative

Also passengers for a Turkish arrive were also waiting at the gate when there was an announcement from the Police that there was a security breach and everyone needed to go back to out and wait and again come through security and passport control. There was chaos as those who had bought duty free had to go back and get their purchases sealed. There were no announcements in English so we had to ask people what was going on. Apparently the crew of the Turkish Airlines had gone through without border and security checks. Delays and confusion were not helped by only having two convey belts used as we all had to go back through security once the all clear was given. No formal apologies. No suggestions of compensation from an airport error. Not a good experience.",Negative,Positive

It's taking me 50 min to queue for checkin and to queue for passport control. Still got another 10 min to wait until passport control then bags security check. All because there's only 1 staff on passport control for about 600 people, a real fine mess if you don't check in 2 hours before your flight. I'd advise to avoid this airport in its current state.",Negative,Positive
Hannover,airport,P Hills,2014-12-18,Do not land here if you are non-EU and in transit. The airport is designed such that if you are an international transit passenger you have to enter Germany before checking in to a connecting flight (despite the fact that it is with the same airline and the connection is only 80 minutes). This means you need a visa for Germany even if you have no intention of entering the country. No other airport I have ever been do you need to get a visa just for being in transit.,Negative,Positive

TSA is okay but did pre-check for last flight and still had to go through regular check. If you are scheduled for an early morning departure, forget any services being open - restaurants / car rental service counters and even the airline service counters. If your flight is at 6:45 and you arrive an hour before your flight, nothing is open.  For car rentals you have to walk quite a ways to / from the terminal through the parking garage to where your vehicle is located. I have been at other airports where your rental is brought curb side for you. Leaving the airport after dark is challenging if you are driving - signs are hard to read and not lit.",Negative,Positive
Hartford,airport,C Clark,2009-02-27,"As a lifelong Connecticut resident I am ashamed at our one major airport - but then I should remember this is small potatoes compared to Boston New York Atlanta Charlotte. The new terminal is clean and bright and a huge improvement over the old provided you are flying airlines that use it. Security seems totally confused and amateur compared to other airports and after checking in you simply deposit your checked luggage in a heap manned by security staff who seem distracted and uninterested in what you are doing. Worst of all is upon return it takes far too long to get your baggage. On a recent calm winter night we'd all deplaned a Delta flight and it took about 20 minutes before any luggage began to appear at the carousels. About 15 bags came out and then there was another 10 minute wait for 15 bags and then on and on. You can generally plan on waiting at least 30 minutes to get your bag at this ""small"" airport.

Havana,airport,Rob Cornhill,2023-07-09,"Worst airport I have been through. When we arrived it took over 1.5 hours to get through, mainly getting our luggage. When we departed, there was only one security line working and the queue soon built to hundreds of people. When we finally got through to the airside we wanted some food as we had left our hotel at 6.30am before breakfast was served. The only food available was a disgusting hot dog in a dried out, stale bread roll. No food was available on on our flight so we had to have a hot dog each. Awful. The only drinks available were beer, Fanta and water. We had a bottle of water each. So 2 hot dogs and 2 waters were US $13. I was hoping to use the last of my Cuban pesos but no, only hard currency accepted airside. So the Cuban pesos will go in the rubbish. There were 3 cafes airside but all served the same menu. I realise Cuba is a developing country but if they want to attract tourists, it's not the way to do it. They need to let private enterprise operate at the airport. No toilet paper in the toilets either.",Positive,Negative
Havana,airport,1 reviewsG Han,2023-05-13,"The worst security check personnel I’ve ever met! Would have given zero star if possible. One of the female security check personnel at the airport is such a disgrace to Cuba. She is incredibly unprofessional and inefficient, and her behavior is an insult to the uniform she wears and the country she represents. After my bag was scanned by the machine, they wanted to do a manual check. Sure, I was actually prepared to cooperate. But the staff opened my bag layer by layer and took her own sweet time to put back the items in a disorganised manner. I reminded her to put back the items back in an orderly manner, and she rudely interrupted me. She took out my Apple Watch charger and asked me what it was for. I pointed to my Apple watch in the tray without touching it, and she shouted at me in Spanish, not to touch it. How rude! She even put my loose sheets of tissue paper directly onto the dirty tray on which travellers put their shoes. Is that the kind of personal hygiene standard she adopts every day at home? How disgusting! This same person also performed “body search” on me twice, once with the handheld scanner and once with her hands. Before the bag search, the body search was already done on me by another female security personnel. When she has searched - and touched - all she wanted, she threw my passport onto the same dirty tray that travellers used to put their shoes.  My other friends who took a later flight also went through a security check by the same staff and reported similar experiences. The airport security clearance is the face of a country. Disgraceful personnel like this should be removed from their positions so as not to further tarnish Cuba’s national image. The immigration officer was also unaware of the visa-free arrangement between Singapore and Cuba and even asked for my visa when clearing immigration. Fortunately, I had printed out the documents sent to me by the Cuban embassy in Singapore before I arrived in Cuba. He was then seen searching through a document on his computer to find the relevant visa-free policy. I couldn’t imagine if I could still board my flight on time if I didn’t show him that document provided by the Cuban embassy in Singapore. Visa-free arrangements are meant to bring convenience to people, and immigration officers are expected to know which passports enjoy visa-free entry at their fingertips.",Negative,Positive
Havana,airport,9 reviewsAndre Bouzid,2018-03-11,"Upon arriving at Jose Marti, the passport control queues were fairly short but the baggage claim area was awful- no air conditioning and hundreds of passengers in a very small area. You couldn't see your bag on the carousel and had to ask others to pass the bag to you. The arrivals hall is very busy and that creates a slightly uncomfortable atmosphere though there are lots of police officers around the ATMs. Getting a taxi is very easy. On departure, everything in the airport moves at a very slow pace- passport control had quite long queues and I was fortunate in that I was able to go through the premium desk. There is one VERY small cafe in the departure lounge that serves ham and cheese sandwiches, ice cream and soft beverages- bring something with you! There is very limited seating so try and find a spot quickly. If you have any CUC left over, you can buy some cigars and rum but be prepared to wait FOREVER in the queue. The gates are extremely close together so my flight to London was next to KLM's flight to Amsterdam in a very tight corner- they need to make more space in the terminal. Overall, it's not an airport I would recommend but I would go through it again out of necessity.",Positive,Negative

They were very unfriendly and unresponsive to their over exaggerated research. (To have in mind people already were checkt 1 or 2 times). I had to throw my son’s toy away because it could be a weapon, I asked them if they were serious and yes that is exactly why I was checking again because me and my son (8) are dangerous. They said we could harm people. I was flabbergasted with what do we exactly harm people with a wooden catapult with paper wraps? Wow Helsinki, I’m very surprised by this.

Hiroshima,airport,Peter Goldsbury,2008-08-26,I live in Hiroshima and regularly use Hiroshima Airport to fly to Tokyo Narita on my way to Europe. This IBEX flight leaves quite early and I usually travel by taxi from Hiroshima. Check-in and security checks are always very smooth but an annoying problem with the IBEX flight to Narita is that the plane is too small to use the normal gates. So we use Gate A walk down the stairs and across the apron to board the plane. Umbrellas are supplied on rainy days. I would use Hiroshima Airport more frequently when travelling to central Tokyo but I think that the plane still cannot beat the Shinkansen for this distance (just over 900 kilometers). It is a pain to have to travel out to the airport 45 kilometers from Hiroshima undergo the check-in and security check board the flight and then have to travel from Haneda to central Tokyo. The journey via JR is only marginally longer and involves far less hassle. Nevertheless as a regional airport Hiroshima is very good.,Negative,Positive

I had purchased my ticket in Havana earlier in the week; it was en e-ticket and so I was surprised at the delay 25 minutes at check in whilst the official went to a back office and wrote out a paper ticket! I queried this. and was told that the worldwide disappearance of paper tickets had not yet taken effect in Holguin! In the departure lounge was a small counter selling drinks and basic refreshments; it accepts only CUP Cuban pesos the national currency as opposed to the CUC convertible peso. Therefore foreign travellers returning to Havana on an internal flight requiring refreshments need to obtain some CUP in advance of their flight. I would not recommend unofficial currency exchange with fellow Cuban passengers within the departure lounge.,Positive,Negative

The lavatories are filthy and no staff near to be found. The signals on the old part of the airport are actually better than the ones on the new terminal which can be confusing to say the least. Prices are the same as in town, but I found the airport express to be a little bit expensive considering the distance.

After finally getting to the front of the line by asking favors from 100+ passengers, I told the lady who did my security check that I was terribly late. She’s like: that’s why you need to get here earlier. I explained to her that airplane made a mistake and this was my second time thought the security line. She said with a big smile: looks like not only you were not able to get in the last time, you are not going to get in this time either. You are going to miss your flight.

We tried to get the attention of an employee who had her head buried in her phone, and appeared to purposely ignore us. We finally tracked down another employee, and were told we would have to wait. My husband is disabled, and has problems standing, and there is zero excuse to not have an ordered wheelchair ready. Once the wheelchair arrived, he was passed off to FOUR different airport employees to get us to our connecting flight. And while he was being transported, at least two of those employees attempted to pass him off, and their colleague either outright refused, or again, had the head buried in the phone, trying to ignore that they may have a job to do. One of the young ladies in security during the connecting flight was also exceptionally rude. Disabled people generally are slower, and are already embarrassed by that, and are doing their best to get the process over and get out of everyone’s way. To have a TSA employee very rudely raising her voice, and throwing things around, is ridiculous and uncalled for. How this airport is highly rated, I have no idea. I hope that someone from IAH reads this, and makes changes to whatever department is in charge of taking care of disabled customers.

Therefore, we weren't able to access the WIFI services. Flight timings weren't prioritized. Passengers who were boarding later flights were prioritized first for the security check. Despite the numerous requests that we made about our flight, we were assured that we would make it on time, therefore, we couldn't progress forward in the line. Out flight started at 3:30 AM, and we were still in the line for security check until 3:00 AM. The bins for the security check were moving very slowly. Bins were moving in sets of four. Between each set, there was a huge gap. Therefore, the entire line moved very slowly. The airport staff were not cooperative or helpful in this process, especially those who helped with the security check. Could you please look into and improve these services?",Positive,Negative
Ibiza,airport,Ian Fraser,2013-11-13,Made our annual visit to Ibiza in September. Some changes some good some bad. The good now a silent airport no plane announcement but the gates are now available on line 24hrs before and put on the boards 1 hour before departure verbal announcements happen if this changes. Plenty of seating in the departure areas and all together a pleasant airport to sit and wait for departure. The bad most arrivals are bussed to the terminal last year and previous it was a 75 yard straight to passport control now they have put in walkways and it is now about 600 yards to walk up and down for old people us not good especially when easy to adjust the straps and cut down the walking distance when little arrival traffic. Getting out similar this year now 3 funnels for customs which feed into each other creating one big bottle neck with those who are leaving it to the last minute trying to push through to the front have made what worked into a disaster. Took us an hour to get through customs and we were nearly the last plane leaving at this time.,Negative,Positive
Incheon,airport,D Hardin,2025-01-23,"The longest lines in an airport ever. The fact that we arrived 3 hours before departure and had literally not enough time to use the toilet before we boarded was a disgrace. I can't review the food or amenities as there was not enough time to access them. 1 hour in line to check in. 1 hour in line for security and checked our bags because it had a pen in it, they made us re pack our bag once they had searched it. We had to run after being made to wait in line for 2.5 hours just to get to our flight at boarding time. There were many empty check in desks too, not enough signage displaying anything. Disgraceful way the airport has been designed. Will not think about visiting Korea again if this is the airport we have to travel through.",Negative,Positive
Incheon,airport,Melissa Song,2025-01-06,Was subjected twice to a security check during a layover here. Absolutely rude security employees. Their lines were incredibly long and took forever. The terminals also posted easily missed handwritten posters to indicate gate changes. Wi-fi did not work for anyone surrounding me. Did they run out of garbage cans because the airport utilized loose and overflowing bags of garbage out on floors. Incredibly inefficient airport.,Negative,Positive

Everything was OK until we arrived at Immigration counter. There were so many people lined up for a very long queue (may be up to 200 people) and the process was so slow. It took us more than 1 hour to pass immigration which we never experienced before. By the time we reteived our luggage, it was pass midnight as we waited in line for the taxi more than half an hour. We reached the hotel which luckily quite close to airport about 1 a.m. It was horrible experience. We wondered why this airport was rated very high (top 1 or 2). Terrible.",Neutral,Negative
Incheon,airport,T Johnson,2023-04-22,"The first time through this airport two weeks ago took no time to get through immigration and customs. Today, it took much longer. We had planned to make hay out of our eight-hour layover and visit Gyeongbokbung Palace. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. After immigration and customs, we went to Hanjin Express to store our carry-on luggage, only to be told there was no more space. That was the final decision point -- we were going to kill the time inside the airport. It's no joke -- this airport is only good if you want to buy designer goods and only if you want a limited brand and product selection. I footed the entire terminal from branch to branch and there is nothing that highlights Korean culture in an interesting and/or contemporary way. Don't make the same mistake. If you've got more than four hours go somewhere outside this airport. I hear there are good outlet malls nearby.",Negative,Positive

Most shops and restaurants are closed by 9 or 930pm -airport has a lot of renovations works so its very noisy with drilling etc -airport shops charges USD except the 711 and food court, if you want to pay KRW they will convert it but the rates is too high -ahjummas at thé chocolate shops and duty free will scold you if you ask on the products - staff are unfriendly and will scold you if you ask.

Not a little but extremely loud mechanical tools sawing through metals and wood. Dust coming over the protective walls causing coughing and eye irritation. What were they thinking.

We flew business and yet again the lounge was full. It’s like stepped no back in time. Security slow, passport control was a reasonable pace as there were plenty of border control officers. Birding on a bus to travel 150 yards is a joke. Bad for the environment and gives yet more poor customer experience.

We could not check in online but went through COVID verification and were questioned if we were staying in another EU country for more than 90 days. The airport police also gave warnings to people who did not wear their masks. Repeat offenders were told they will be asked to leave the airport.

Innsbruck,airport,R Tompkins,2017-03-21,This airport is one of those that is probably lovely 95% of the time and a disaster the other 5%. Unfortunately I got the 5%. Its tiny and cant handle large amounts of luggage or passengers. An absolute free-for all at baggage reclaim with people standing 6 deep by the tiny carousel and then nowhere for them to go once getting luggage. They eventually opened up the red 'to declare' channel and just let everyone exit out that way to reduce the crowding. On the return nightmare queues to the doors at the limited check-in desks and many people ended up sitting on the stairs blocking them once through security as nowhere to sit. One café air side with a long queue. Its convenient but you have been warned.,Negative,Positive
Innsbruck,airport,J Diss,2013-10-15,Travelled late July. Arriving from Edinburgh late afternoon found the airport quiet. Standing at the back of a long line for passport control I thought we could in for a long wait. But they virtually waved the entire plane load through in around 3 minutes! By which time the luggage had already arrived. So we were out of the airport within 5 minutes. I've never known anything like it. On the way back there were several flights delayed due to a storm. However everything still worked well for our flight and we departed on time. Not a big airport but I was happy with my time there.,Positive,Negative
Innsbruck,airport,M Hutchison,2012-02-08,"Arriving on January 28th no problems. The baggage arrived quickly and we were soon on our way. Nothing could have prepared us for the departure however. It was a nightmare. The baggage check-in took a long time - only 3 desks for an Airbus A332 with nearly 300 passengers. The plane was delayed one hour but that didn't seem to help. It took us nearly an hour in a completely disorganised ""queue"". The check-in assistants had no sense of urgency chatted amongst themselves and couldn't even manage to put 4 people on the same booking in the same part of the plane! At security it was utter chaos - more than an hour in a crush everyone trying to get to the front and in to one of the two security bay in order to catch their planes. Looking at the reviews here and comments from staff at the airport it would appear that this has been going on for years! It was intolerable and potentially unsafe - one person in our huddle (it could in no sense be described as a queue) fainted.

Upon arrival security officers shooed me away from several busy passport control areas before I found one where I could get in line after a very long walk. Lufthansa lost my bag. Dealing with Celebri, their baggage handler, was a dragged out, exhausting ordeal. I had no communication from them after making lost bag claim for more than 48 hours. Phones were not answered and calls not returned after leaving messages three times. Bag was finally located four days later, when I had boarded ship for Viking cruise but was still in port. The Lufthansa baggage service, Celebri, refused to deliver my bag to cruise ship at the port or release it to Viking representative at airport. Celebri made me return to airport in person to claim my bag. The airport is a LONG ride from town. Celebri is hidden in a secure area and can only be reached by a telephone by an unmanned information kiosk. Celebri employee who answered phone said she was eating lunch and would come out to help me in ten minutes. Multiple other travelers showed up, called Celebri and were given various snarky answers as to when a representative would come out to help us. It was more than 30 minutes later when a surly young man came out and guided us back to the secure area. The only answer I was given for why I had to claim my bag in person was “Customs.” After four days without my suitcase, being forced to retrieve it in person at the airport was an abusive four hour descent into a hell of rude, indifferent Celebri employees in an airport that is already not passenger friendly.

If one flies with Garuda, Citilink (domestic or international) or any international airline the departure or arrival is in Terminal 3. It is a modern building where unfortunately distances can be sometimes a bit of a challenge, especially upon arrival (often it is a true hike from plane to passport control/luggage belt). Both terminals have enough food options to relax a bit or to kill time when you are delayed.

Jeddah,airport,K Haleem,2023-08-27,"Our journey from Jeddah to Qatar, with a transit stop in Riyadh, was marred by a series of unfortunate events that left us deeply disappointed. As we approached the check-in counter at Jeddah airport, we encountered an attendant whose receptiveness seemed notably absent. Despite our attempts to communicate our situation, she briskly processed our documents and handed out boarding passes, albeit segregating our family onto separate rows. To our dismay, she omitted the essential luggage tags for both our hand luggage and the baby stroller, abruptly departing the counter with her personal belongings, leaving us bewildered and adrift. Our attempts to seek clarity were met with further frustration. A request to summon a supervisor was met with a dismissive response, as she claimed to be unaware of the supervisor's whereabouts. With her departure, we found ourselves adrift, until we chanced upon a more accommodating staff member at a different counter. He promptly rectified the oversight, issuing the requisite tags for our belongings, bringing some semblance of order to the situation. Upon our arrival at Riyadh International Airport, the pre-arranged wheelchair assistance for my mother was conspicuously absent.  In summation, the cumulative experience involving Flynas Airlines, Jeddah, and Riyadh airports was profoundly disheartening.

Naturally, the baggage carousel was broken which meant people and some staff started climbing over the broken/stuck/non-functioning carousel to try get their bags. All in all, 75 minutes to disembark, get stamped in, struggle to locate and find baggage before having to redo the whole process again for domestic departures since FlySafair counters aren’t available in the part of the airport where international visitors could easily switch. And of course; none of this is explained or communicated among the dozen broken, glitching screens or dozens of empty booths.

If granted access to VIP room nearby there is air-condition but one must go through additional security checks. A new terminal is being constructed.

Kaliningrad,airport,39 reviewsR Janssen,2019-10-14,"A small airport which got completely upgraded because of the FIFA 2018 games in Russia. On arrival be aware that border control takes 5 min per person. They thoroughly check your whole passport, visa and picture. The airport doesn't have many facilities, only 1 duty free store and some small shops. It's best to use the official taxi service, as there are many scams. A trip from the airport to the city center takes about 30 min and about 700 rubles. Most flights are domestic Russian ones with some international ones. Staff are friendly but don't expect smiles all the time.",Neutral,Positive
Kaliningrad,airport,Gert van Dijk,2009-08-09,Kaliningrad airport is currently undergoing reconstruction so it might have improved after this review. The only way to get out of the plane is by stairs. They use one set of stairs per plane. Expect long queues at check in - usually there is only one desk per flight available. Before customs the airport has 1 bar 1 restaurant 2 souvenir shops and small chemist. After customs there is one bar and a duty free store. Prices are decent but the quality at the restaurant requires a Russian stomach in to appreciate the food. Make sure to use the toilet in the plane before landing after landing before customs there is only 1 toilet. The other toilets before customs are dirty and smelly. There is an information desk but they only speak Russian. There are enough taxi's available - choose a registered taxi (with a sign) to avoid being ripped off. There are no other means of transport (bus lines or trains) to leave the airport. The sound installation in the terminal is lousy. In combination with the poor English of the announcers announcements are incomprehensible. Security is pragmatic and efficient. There is an x-ray and metal detector when entering the airport.,Negative,Positive
Kalmar,airport,5 reviewsOliver Andersin,2019-01-24,"Kalmar Airport is small and get's the job done for what it is. When you arrive it looks like a small red traditional Swedish house, The check-in area is not huge, and I imagine there can be long lines for larger flights. There is a small cafeteria in-between check-in and baggage claim, and this is the only source of food inside the airport (except if you are flying charter, then there is a small bar at the gates), so if you want a bite before flying, eat there. Security is fast and even has a fast track lane, speaking of priority, there is no priority check-in or lounge. The departure area has a bar and shop, but they are only open during charter flights. You can also pick up a free edition of Barometern (the local news paper) at the departure area. Boarding is smooth, but could take time if it's a larger charter flight.",Positive,Negative

Kansai International,airport,Kevin Barrance,2023-10-17,Total chaos arriving at this airport. The lines for immigration were so badly done that nobody knew where to stand or what to do. Lack of staff to man the various photo and fingerprint machines. Despite already completing the immigration and customs formalities online and getting a QR code it seemed a total waste of time considering how badly everything was handled. Once out of this melee and over to the train station you are met with more chaos and only the actions of the kindhearted and very efficient Trip.com assistant were we able to understand how to circumvent the huge queue for the Kansai express train to Kyoto.

The gate seating area only sat 55 passengers. More shops and restaurants, why are there any at all? An airport is not a destination, it's a thoroughfare.

Kansas City,airport,J Rulo,2023-07-12,The new airport is very pretty but there are some important things missing. The signage is not great. They must have forgotten about signs for baggage claim because they only have sandwich boards in the main terminal area directing you to the baggage claim. We found NO SIGNS for rental car area. Finally got a broadcast on the PA regarding car rental location and shuttle. The TSA lines were very long even though not many people are here. They had the area roped of as if they were expecting a large crowd and didn't bother to shorten the lanes when not needed causing people to walk more than necessary. The new seats are uncomfortable. Our TSA person at the baggage check area was rude and didn't seem to know the rules for people over 75. I realize it is a work in progress but seems like some of these issues should have been obvious to the designers and planners. Lets hope it gets better as time goes by.,Negative,Positive

I emailed the airline at the airport and the airports reservations area and they never replied. The airline was good enough to get everybody a hotel until they could get us rebooked which took 2 days. I had to miss work and accrued additional expenses the whole time. I finally get my new flight and checked my bags and went through TSA which was all fine but then we take a shuttle to the plane where they search everybody’s bag again, and then do a pat down again right in front of the aircraft. TSA and security must not be effective if they have to go to these redundant repetitive checks at multiple locations.

First, they mixed up the gates, switching from Priority to Non-priority back and forth, causing confusion and causing people to run from gate to gate, pushing each other and annoying each other from losing their spaces in line over and over. The duty free shop in Terminal A cannot be classified as functional as they told me they do not have 10 grosz to return me from 9.90 purchase (when I paid with 10 Zloty). Very hard to believe since there are 3 cash machines in the store. In addition, staff hardly knows any English and the safety control staff once regarded my Nintendo game console (released around 2015) for a dangerous device - could use an update on recent technology.

Kefalonia,airport,Philip Chinnery,2019-07-18,"A nightmare is the only way to describe it. The airport infrastructure is too small to handle more than one plane at a time and you will be made to stand on the tarmac in the sun either to board the plane or to have your passport checked on arrival. You may also be halfway through deplaning when the ground crew stop you, while another plane taxies out. Tip - get the crew to shut the doors quickly or all the fumes from the departing plane will go through yours like a dragon's breath. Our skipper lost his cool with the tower when it happened to us on arrival. The temporary baggage hall is literally a joke; the bags keep jamming the belt as they enter from outside due to poor design and expect a wait of 45 minutes while the luckless lady on duty tries to sort out the mess. At the end of your holiday, when you go to leave from the newly built terminal building you will discover a number of things - there may be four flights getting ready to depart, but there are only 25 seats in each of the four gate areas. The duty-free shop is too small and the snack bar usually has a queue around 20 people long - tip - buy your food on the way to the airport. When you do go through the gate and down towards the ramp you may well have to stop for 10-15 minutes while the ground staff do their thing - it does not matter if you are old, ill or young, you will all be made to stand there without any shade.

On offer are pre-packaged cold sandwiches sold to you by equally cold, unwelcoming personnel. The tables in the service area are not cleaned, with dirty dishes piling up and with nearly all tables, filthy as they are, occupied by passengers waiting for their flights. In order to get to any other eating establishment besides those three, you have to go back beyond passport control and then re-enter the terminal through passport control once again. That is what a service person told me, in all seriousness. Perhaps in Iceland such standards of service are acceptable, but elsewhere they certainly are not.

Kiev Borispol,airport,A Walker,2020-02-24,"I have used Borispol terminal F on several occasions over the last 10 years, when you enter the airport you have a security check of your personal belongings this is not the main security and everyone has to go through it to get into the terminal, this naturally causes long waits and it is totally unnecessary. I have not had to endure check in here as I normally use hand luggage only. The main security and passport control are upstairs and are fine and the guards speak good english. Once through passport control there is very little to do but to wait for your flight with no duty free shops or in fact any shops. There are two extremely expensive snack stalls with very limited choice. On the plus side there are plenty of seats of the normal uncomfortable airport style. Also lots of great views of the apron and runway. In the last 10 years of travelling to and from Ukraine terminal F it is now worse than ever. The owners have modernised it since my first flight here in 2010, although it is now Borispol's LCC terminal but the lack of facilities and shops lets it down, it's a pity because the empty shops are there just waiting for companies to take them or waiting for the airport owners to allow shops in to this terminal.",Negative,Positive

If you want to buy anything else, its not possible, because there are just these two ""shops"". Smokers - buy cigarettes before you go there, yes, there is smoking room but you can not buy cigarettes. Also the police are arrogant and awful and they don't speak english. Also personnel on check-in don't speak english. They told us, that there is everything, but honestly. There is nothing. Toilets are like wc at summer festivals, smell really bad. You will sit on bad chairs, no comfort there. Its really a huge difference between Terminal D and Terminal F. They told us, that F is new, but to be honest, it's not new and modern.

None of the staff are friendly or helpful, they expect you to know where you are going and are brusque, even rude, in conversation. The other traveler who spoke about the unprofessionalism of the terminal security staff is one I experienced as well. There were 6 security agents, yet one male made the sole female do all of the checking for both of my bags, not even deigning to speak to her, just pointing at things he wanted searched—and even though he knew my flight was at final call. (After the initial boarding announcement, I went to the bathroom and 5 min later it was final call, another issue I have with the airport). He refused to let me inform the ground staff that I was there, when they were just through the checkpoint only 10 meters, not even allowing me to call out to them and making me almost miss my flight with the 20 min search. He pulled out my Emergen-C and Advil packets and accused me of being sick (when I told him I am preventing myself from getting sick!) and told me that my small packets of energy gels and anti malaria pills were not allowed. I was so frustrated with their lack of professionalism and empathy, Kigali Airport needs to train their staff to be gender equal and educated on what exactly what is banned and what is not. I was able to take all my belongings at the end, as a superior staff came and told the man that I was able to take everything he told me I couldn’t.

They have recently added a Burger King but the shops are very limited and if you are on a night flight all shops are closed. The staff need to improve their customer service skills as they rarely smile and appear quite serious and some can be quite abrupt.

I arrived with a Widerøe turboprop flight from Vardø and we were 2 passengers on board. We had to walk the few metres from the plane to the terminal building but unfortunately both doors to the arrival hall were locked. The guy who drove the little baggage cart for our flight suggested to follow him. So we entered the terminal through a ""back door"". Two suitcases were on the brand new belt immediately so we didn't had time to watch the modern interior of the terminal. Unfortunately both suitcases belonged to the other passenger. So I ringed somebody out of the closed SAS office to complain about my missing luggage. When he took the details about my blue suitcase he suddenly stopped went back into the office and came out with my suitcase. It arrived on an earlier and direct flight. As the airport bus runs only once a day on saturdays he offered to call a taxi. This will need 12 minutes to arrive from town because there usually are no taxis at the airport waiting.

Then the worst most shameful behaviour was shouting at my wife’s cousin in Hindi and asking him to leave because he had no ticket and obviously had no confidence to stand up to this staff member. Airline staff could say or do nothing as they explained it was another jurisdiction. My wife finally had the last word by saying we have international passports this despite this man’s threat he could detain us for ‘time wasting’ he of course could not. This is not the first time we have seen such inefficient and jobs worthy behaviour from a domestic airport in india but today was the worst most unnecessary form of communication. Thankfully checkin, security and boarding staff were clear and polite with their communication and behaviour. I have no doubt if I had not been a white man, then my wife and her cousin would have received even worse conduct from this so called security official in a faux uniform. Please could these staff be trained in English, foreign passports, foreign name-reading and understanding code share or international airline boarding passes on a smart phone app before they are given such jobs - and how to behave with fellow human beings. Quite clearly he was biased against younger men and women of his own ethnicity.",Positive,Negative

There are too many slights arriving and departing for the airport. There are limited restrooms.

I will not return to Kos, even though I had a lovely holiday I could not go back until this airport is refurbished.

Immigration and immigration staff are not professional and lacked basic communication skills as I was told to wait for 4 hours without any notice or information before being able to exit through the immigration. Once I went through immigration I was shocked as the airport looked very untidy, unclean and old. The toilets are also very unhygenic and unsanitary as it reaked of waste and the floorings were all wet. The only good experience that I had whilst on my transit was eating McD.

Kota Kinabalu,airport,Michael Lau,2012-05-31,Arrived at the BKI low cost terminal from Taipei via AirAsia and took a cab that charged RM30 from the low cost terminal to the main terminal (i.e. terminal 1) to catch MASwing domestic flight to SBW. To be fair the main terminal was far better than the low cost terminal as it was quieter and more spacious. The big lacking of this terminal was that the air conditioning did not seem to function properly causing the whole airport to be humid hot and uncomfortable. The departure hall was almost empty with very limited choices of shops and restaurants. My feeling was that this airport was simply under used and should definitely need more to- and-fro flights. The other downside was that the announcement was barely heard and the poor command in languages especially English language did not help at all. Would not recommend this airport for long transit like mine.,Negative,Positive
Krabi,airport,K Jackson,2020-02-27,"The rudest staff I have ever encountered at an airport. They must do a roaring trade in Power packs. I too was advised that my power pack needed to be in my hand luggage. Then when my hand luggage was checked I was told I could not take it as they could not read the capacity on it. I offered to look details up etc but nothing I said was of any interest to them. This is the first time that I have encountered this at any airport with the same power pack. Again as others, I explained that I had been allowed to take it on the same airline to arrive in Krabi. There was no previous warning of this. When we suggested that we destroy the power pack (rather than hand over to them) I was told this was not possible. For such a small airport, in such a lovely place, this is such a strange rule and very unfair as it left me without the ability to re-charge my phone. As stated previously, even when we complained, I was told that I could not take the persons name, and could not complain to anyone! The other staff just looked on giving us dirty looks! To be honest their attitude was disgusting and the supervisor we spoke to, just shrugged and put a piece of paper in front of us saying that all Power packs should be in hand luggage, then pointed to the small print of the capacity needed to be visible! Pretty useless advise if you are not advised in advance by the airport or the airline we were travelling with.",Positive,Negative

Staff were extremely rude and dismissive from the start! They wouldn’t attempt to communicate and explain why I could not bring a power bank (even though I brought it into Krabi via Bangkok) just kept showing me a card to read. Annoyingly the wattage was no longer viable and they just kept saying ‘no prove’ even though they could clearly see the power pack was very small and was nowhere near the wattage limit. I even pulled up the official product website to show them to which they just laughed and said 'no'. I wouldn’t be so annoyed if there was signage showing they aren’t allow or if staff had attempted to communicate why it wasn’t allowed rather then just laugh and put it in the bin.",Positive,Negative
Krakow,airport,1 reviewsM Badura,2023-10-28,"Very bad Ryanair ground handling staff picking fights with passengers. Please beware of this while traveling. I paid for extra luggage at the gate and requested the lady at the gate if I can carry the bag with me instead of putting it in hold. She took her time to check and then finally confirmed that I could indeed take it with me. At the ground a guy who called himself ""team lead"" repeatedly called me aside and asked me to handover the bag. I told him that I have paid for it now and she told me I can bring the bag with me. To which he responds, ""you can't take it, i am the team lead, and you should listen to what I say"". He then pretends to make a call to the gate and then tells me , ""i spoke to the lady, she doesn't know anything, if you want to board this flight then you have to handover the luggage to me"". I then asked him if I can go under a shed and take my laptop out and then return the bag, he says, i don't care how you carry your laptop, carry it in hand or however. I then finally take it out and handover the bag and start walking to the back entry, he again follows me saying that you can't board the flight, i don't like the way you gave me the bag, i am calling the police. At that point, (me clearly irritated ) told him to bring the police so I can also describe how he is harassing me for something so petty. My boyfriend then apologizes to him and explains that we specifically asked her to check because there was a laptop and she confirmed it was okay. We are sorry but we are also stressed with all of this. To this the guy immediately switches and allows the bag in. He then responds that just because u apologized I am letting this bag in. She should have requested me from the beginning and I would have let the bag in. Instead she started telling me that she has checked with someone inside and paid for the luggage and all. I deserve respect since I am the team lead and she needs to know that she has to respect me! "" Why am I writing this review? I wasn't sure why I was harassed at the ground despite of following all rules and paying them whatever they asked for and waiting until the airport authority at the gate confirmed? It is a shame that the airport doesn't look into the mental health of their employees who clearly were taking out frustration on what they believed were ""easy targets"". And then they think they can just bully people by threatening to call the cops, just because he can ( i believe). He was clearly upset that he wasn't getting enough respect (in general) and I urge the Airport to review this behaviour. No one wants to really engage in an argument while on a trip but situations like these that are created for no reason just ruin a good holiday.",Negative,Positive

You have to wait until closer to flight time for the gates to open. No travel comfort or customer service at all. This is worse than the airport in underdeveloped countries like Vietnam or Cambodia.

Kunming,airport,D Gagliardo,2019-12-27,"I had to pass through Kunming airport on my way to Thailand. It was simply for a layover flight, but our layover was 13 hours. Given that the purpose of our vacation was not China, we didn’t wish to deal with the hassle of leaving the airport. We assumed that being in an airport for 13 hours, there must be some place to sleep, right? Well, we discovered the “rest lounge” on the bottom floor, it was full of uncomfortable chairs that do not recline and cannot be moved. I did not wish for both me and my partner to be asleep in an unfamiliar airport and country at the same time so stayed awake away while he slept. Our 13 hours was from 6pm-7am the next day - so the middle of the night. The rest area was filled with visitors who were loud all throughout the night, very hard to fall asleep. We moved to some chairs that were actually more uncomfortable than the first, but we could move them against each-other and actually lay down. Well that worked, until the literal police awoke us at 12.30am as they came towards us on segways and yelled at us and made us move the chairs back. We drifted upstairs in search of refuge. We found a sleeping lounge, I gladly was ready to pay money for a wink of sleep, they would not let foreigners use the sleep lounge! You would think that at an international airport they would have an option for foreigners to get some sleep in a situation such as ours. All of the kiosks were closed, we couldn’t figure out how to use the ATM which was fine, our fault, but when we asked restaurants if we could use our cards they yelled “no!” At us and turned away. When the kiosks did open up, they sent us from one counter to another for about 2 hours. Never giving us a straight answer, we were very sleep deprived and simply trying to get answers. Finally we got an answer as to where we could check-in, and then they changed it on us 3 different times. We ended up sleeping in restaurant chairs guarding our things until we were able to check-in. I understand the airport is located in China, but for a foreigner at an international airport I was very displeased and baffled by the quality of service. Will definitely never be scheduling a flight through Kunming airport ever again.",Negative,Positive

We got to the airport 2.5 hours before to drop off the car and then walked the very long walk to the terminal building. Once there the security opened earlier than usual so was in the departure lounge early. Unfortunately the duty free lounge didn't open and one of the vending machines was broken. The services in the departure lounge are poor and there needs to be consistency on when the duty free is open. Boarding began before the plane arrived and we were off quickly 50 mins late as expected.

Lagos,airport,S Anderson,2019-02-27,"I travelled home from holiday in Lagos by myself with my two little daughters (1 and 3 years old). At immigration I experienced hostility, rudeness, lack of understanding and the most intimidating behavior by a female immigration officer. Traveling alone with two children is already difficult but when you are treated this way at immigration leaving the country on a European passport on a flight to Europe, it comes close to harassment. My husband is Nigerian and he has never been treated like this when travelling on a visa or with his residence card to/from the UK or to/from my native European country. I felt like the immigration officer tried to put a fault on me, constantly saying that she had been about to let me pass because of the children but the way I was talking to her would make her not to let me through. During all conversations I was most polite and even when using 'please' and 'madam' several times when speaking, she was still insisting that I was talking to her in a bad way. Most disappointing and daunting experience I ever had which made me feel that she was actually looking to be bribed.

Had to queue and try to complete the landing card at the same time. Why can't we get this on the plane? Then immigration checks the passports. If you travel in a group then one person presents all the passports while the others wait to one side hence the chaos as several officials now begin to ask the rest of the family, where are your passports. I think they were asked 3 times! I presented the passports to the 1st chap, then I had to move across to the other chap next to him. He checks it again! Then he says to me, have you got something for me? In other words money. A bit aggressive and unfriendly. I give him $4 and go on my merry way. Then we wait for the luggage. Well! That took about an hour for our bags to arrive. And thats my biggest gripe. I will be travelling light next time. Out of the airport was just as chaotic. Touts everywhere, asking if you want to change money or a taxi or a trolley. Best thing is not to make eye contact and just walk away. Getting out of the car park was just as chaotic, that took an hour too!",Negative,Positive
Lagos,airport,1 reviewsB Morrison,2017-12-12,"I arrived at the Arik Air domestic terminal (having taken an internal flight from Abuja) and departed on BA from the international terminal. Arik Air use remote stands and bus you to the terminal. Business class passengers get their own mini-bus, which is more than BA offer when they occasionally use a bus at LHR. The terminal is in a decrepit condition but quick to get through. Fortunately I didn't have baggage to collect. The worst part of the experience was the chaotic taxi ""queue"" area outside the terminal. Fortunately, I was with a Nigerian business partner who knew the form, but I wouldn't have wanted to navigate that on my own. I departed on BA from the international terminal. I had heard the horror stories about Lagos traffic so allowed plenty of time to get to the airport. In the event the cab ride from Victoria Island was only 40 mins so I was very early. I checked in online and printed by own boarding pass so by-passed check-in. The terminal is in a bad condition (although not as awful as the domestic one) but there were no queues and it was actually quite efficient. As I had checked in online I didn't know about or have a departure card. The immigration officer filled in it for me. I think he was expecting a ""tip"" but I just smiled and walked away. The BA lounge is like something from the 1970s, but plenty of seats and a reasonably good selection of snacks. The priority boarding procedure was a bit chaotic but not too bad. They let ""infants"" board first, which seemed to include kids of up to about 15 years old! All in all, not as bad as expected.",Negative,Positive
Lagos,airport,J Johnson,2016-02-16,"Transiting through Lagos to catch a United flight to Houston was an unmitigated disaster.

Took my passport. 8 different people will tell you 8 different stories or people to go talk to. Finally with my passport located I was escorted to the gate through Duty Free, security checkpoints etc. At the gate, my bag was checked, scanned, and rescanned and rescanned as the scanner needed re-alignment. In 15 minutes, I was checked 5 times by the same security staff even though I was just standing there the whole time. What possibly could have changed every 3 minutes requiring a check?

Nearly all the seats were taken, there is just a small cafe selling a very small array of snacks which looked unappealing, and a newsagent. That's it, The toilets were the worst I have ever experienced in any airport, the smell was horrendous. The fan going in there did nothing to make it better.

Apparently not enough bus drivers. The ones we saw where busy joking around. This caused our flight to miss the a lot and we are delayed by about a hour. Still sat here on the 14th January. Really disgraceful service from a poorly run operation. Cattle get treated better than this place!

Lanzarote Arrecife,airport,Clare Fiore,2022-07-26,Since I last visited this airport they have replaced most of manual passport control with E-gates which families with young children cannot use. This is a bad error of judgement considering how many families with young children come through this airport. We queued for over half an hour for passport control. My daughter needed the toilet and there was access to none because they had barriered them off until you got right to the front of the queue. We then missed our transfer as were it took an hour to get through the airport. The E-gates were only being used by about 20% of travellers and staff were walking down the queue trying to find travellers who could use them. What a waste of money installing them or so many of them.,Negative,Positive
Lanzarote Arrecife,airport,Nadine Rzigui,2022-06-18,"This airport is one of the worst airports I have been into in my life. Disability with my mum pushing me in a wheelchair, no help whatsoever .. they could see us struggling and just say staring at us but helped everyone else. Didn't help us get the bags or anything.  Airport is tiny, crowded. No room to do anything especially with a wheelchair. Gates are all squeezed in with the restaurants and cafe so your standing next to people getting food while their in a queues at their gate number. No food available for allergy sufferers.  Special assistance people have to wait until the whole plane gets on first then they get on last even though your put at the front to get on first? Makes no sense. There's a reason why it's called special assistance. Jet2 woman did not care at all that we were distressed, stood there like a wet lemon. Not sure why she was there. Absolutely no staff to look after the ones needing special assistance.  Very unorganized and unprofessional. Won't be returning back to this airport.",Negative,Positive
Larnaca,airport,John Read,2025-03-01,The airport has introduced a screen check at passport control on departure. EEC passports go through in 5 minutes.

Larnaca,airport,Bernhard Senkerik,2024-04-24,"The airport is a relatively small international airport that is easy to navigate. The checkin lines are a gamble as some airlines have short queues and some are ridiculously long. The passport control and security check was a relatively quick process, even though the security staff is one of the most unfriendly I've experienced. The duty free area is large, however the prices, especially for food and drinks are very high (even for an airport). The seating area is relatively quiet and there are usually enough seats available with bathrooms and kiosks in walking distance from the gates. Due to the small size of the airport even the bus journeys are not long to the plane, although we had airbridges on both departure and arrival. Besides the indifference of the staff, the only really bad thing at the airport are the sometimes very long wait times (30 minutes+) at the luggage carousels. This is especially the case during off peak times when it should actually go quicker. This time, however, it was a relatively quick process and the bags where already there when we arrived. I think the airport is nice small airport without any thrills but also nothing that makes me hate it.",Negative,Positive

Las Vegas,airport,D Keares,2024-07-16,This airport is disgusting. The bathrooms are filthy with urine and unworking flush mechanisms. Floors throughout terminal 1 appear to rarely get swept or mopped. Im amazed the airport can pass a foodservice inspection. We ate breakfast at the wendys and the seating areas and tables had spilled drinks and food all around the dining space. Trash overflowing. It seems the cleaning crew are non existent or inept.

Las Vegas,airport,52 reviewsMahmud Noormohamed,2024-06-15,Review limited to Terminal 1. Arrived at the D gates. The D concourse appears to have more amenities which appear to have more amenities than the B concourse. The concourse is bright and spacious. Departure was from B concourse. The B concourse has only 2 restaurants and lacks amenities. Slot machines take up most of the space at the gates which makes for a very crowded gate area. I didn't notice any in seat USB and/or power outlets. The B concourse needs major renovations to align it the modern and spacious terminals you see at other airports. There is no lounge at either B or C concourse. Free Airport WiFi is fast. We dined at PGA restaurant. One of the worst meals we've had. Our meals were comped (fish & chips) as it was not up to the restaurant's standards.,Negative,Positive
Launceston,airport,Barry Hardstaff,2021-03-22,I just want to have an explanation for why I was charged .18 cents on top of the purchase for a glass of Chardonnay when paying by card - savings account.

This is wrong and your airport personnel need to address this issue especially when dealing with COVID19. I would like an explanation.,Negative,Neutral

I had to first take my nail scissors etc out. It was embarrassing and no one was able to help me and the staff were unfriendly. There is no other entry to the shops etc but through the security area. It is ridiculous. I am so stressed and upset over the whole episode.,Negative,Positive
Leipzig/halle,airport,Matthias Hermann,2008-01-09,Huge airport serving the cities of Leipzig and Halle and good connections to Berlin as well (roughly 1 hour by express train). Oversized shiny modern. Due to its huge size one has to walk quite far through the whole airport to reach the rail station (oversized as well) which is located at the opposite end of the arrivals / departure hall. Good and fast connection to the city centres of Halle and Leipzig but very unfairly calculated fare - they let you cross several fare zones so you have to pay more than for comparable distances in that region. Because of new restrictions for landing and taking off after 11 pm - interestingly there are NO restrictions for cargo flights - many budget airlines have cancelled their services to this airport and now only few major European cities are still served by non-stop flights . Very sad since the alternatives now are Altenburg Airport or one of the Berlin airports. However having to go there first from Leipzig or Halle increases the overall time of your journey massively.,Negative,Positive
Liberia,airport,Garry Collier,2024-03-11,"Whenever I travel I try to avoid having to go through Toronto or Newark airports, two places that seem designed to discourage people from travelling. I've just added Liberia to that list. It clearly was not built to handle the traffic of increased tourism and both arriving and departing reflect that fact. Clearing Customs takes time as the lineups can be long and slow moving, in a hot, humid building. Departing is also an exercise in patience, as waiting passengers are jammed into an area designed for a fraction of their number. Seats are cherished items, boarding lines are more like boarding scrums and the prices for everything in the building are beyond ridiculous. Water can cost $10US a bottle, basic burgers $19, and fries $9.50. Last minute souvenir items are similarly overpriced, even by airport standards. There is nothing appealing about this airport other than the fact it's bright inside. A necessary evil if it's by far the closest airport to your destination but one to be avoided if you can arrange to go through SJ.",Negative,Positive
Liberia,airport,4 reviewsJuan Carlos Yogi,2016-03-29,"Used Liberia Airport to depart on JetBlue to New York JFK. It's mid-size compared to other airports in Central America yet it seems more crowded and things are more expensive. They have the usual airport shops but on a smaller scale and less organized. Travelers are scattered all over confused with no clear indication as to where a line starts and ends. Staff make no real effort to make things more efficient. As a matter of fact they barely speak English. There is a lack of seating both in departure and arrivals areas. You have passengers standing around before boarding their flights. Bathrooms are large but still a lack of facilities for the number of passengers. Boarding announcements are done with a microphone, often times speaking on top of each other which made it hard for me to understand. Lots of confusion. Food and drinks are overpriced. It's located about 10 miles from city center and taxis overprice at $20-$35USD on average. I stayed about 2 miles away and was still charged $12USD. When considering this airport calculate prices to see if you’re actually saving money when you add in higher prices for transport, food and accomadation in the area. Would fly from here again if savings outweigh the stress.",Negative,Positive
Libreville,airport,8 reviewsH Blumenthal,2015-11-27,Libreville Airport is certainly not the worst airport in the region but not the best either.

We got off the plane, walked to a hall immediately, and then it was the exit and taxis were waiting, I guess all the way from the plane to the taxi was less than 100 meters. Hopefully, it was a flight in the schengen area, otherwise, as I took a glimpse, the border control would be a bit of a nightmare.",Positive,Negative
Linz,airport,Hendrik Bower,2006-10-12,The airport is tiny the shops are few and expensive even when compared to other small Austrian airports such as Salzburg. The opening times are poor by western standards (this is a general trend in the country). There is a departure room at Linz where once you have gone in you cannot go out . There is no prior warning of this fact there are armed police there to stop you leaving something to do with international law depends where your destination country is. It is literally one room before the runway with one drinks machine (poor) and one food machine (poor).

Lisbon,airport,A Baldene,2025-01-08,"Lisbon Airport is one of the most crowded airports to fly from. The queue at Terminal 1 was extremely long, and EasyJet did not help the situation as they were slow in attending to the earliest passengers. The security control at the airport was particularly inefficient, with only a few security processing lines functioning out of many available in the terminal. This caused long queues at security, and the processing of passengers took much longer than expected. As a result, the five of us missed our flight, despite having already checked in. Although we reported this issue to EasyJet and called to explain our ordeal, there was no assistance offered. It was apparent that they were already aware of the chaos at the security control, yet the airport's management did nothing to improve the situation. Passengers were left to bear the loss without any accountability or remorse from the airline or the airport authorities.

Liverpool,airport,Leslie Cadwallader,2023-01-25,"It's a long while since I have posted a review here, but I have not changed my opinion of Liverpool Airport: for my wife and myself it is always our first choice. It is never crowded, we know our way around and we have never had a negative experience when passing through. About three years ago we had to switch to Manchester Airport when our flight was cancelled and we hated the crowds, the queues and the struggle for seats. In comparison, passing through Liverpool is a doddle. We've never had any problem at security which is light and airy compared with the claustrophobic equivalent at Manchester. It helps that we travel hand baggage only, so we can bypass the queues to hand in hold bags and don't have to wait at baggage reclaim on the way back. We're not interested in buying food and drink prior to our flight and we know that even if we are delayed en route to the airport we'll still progress through the airport to the boarding gate with time to spare. Passport control can be a bottleneck on return, but even that seems to have been speeded up in the last year or so. As long as it does not over-expand in terms of flights, we will be content to use Liverpool Airport for as long as we continue to fly.",Positive,Negative
Liverpool,airport,Anthony Haynes,2022-09-19,"Upon arrival at Liverpool Airport it was just a disaster the moment we sat foot on the tarmac in the pouring rain. The young lady with the Swissport vest organising our movement was completely out of her depth. We were told to wait in the rain for 15 to 20 minutes before we were moved to what I can only describe as the luggage train area. Once there we were told to move here there and everywhere while the polite baggage handlers drove their luggage carts in between us all. At one stage a young man arrived wearing a health and safety vest and showed no initiative in any way, so he seemed completely pointless in holding this position. Another time elapsed as the passengers could not enter the building for whatever reason. Once in the arrival building all baggage carousels were stopped and it seemed everyone for themselves to wonder around when we found our luggage at an area where they had just been thrown about on the floor and belt that was not on. It was a complete fiasco and the staff need to be trained properly and professionally and to be informed that if they do not want to be in the position of employment then they need to be told to seek employment elsewhere. They were extremely unprofessional and extremely poorly trained for the positions they hold. I will fly and arrive at an alternate airport in the future. In my employment I have been in and out of airports all over the world and due to the serious lack of knowledge and professional of the staff at this particular airport I would rate this ‘international airport’ as one of the worst airports I have experienced.",Negative,Positive

The staff at security screening are still unsmiling and unfriendly barking orders at passengers and the holding pen/waiting area is still a cramped and poorly laid out mess where the departure boats are impossible to see from the seating areas.

We were already on the verge of missing our transcontinental flight and we were dealing with highly incompetent and indifferent airport staff. After taking the bus between terminals, we had to run another 2 miles inside the airport to get to our gate, also having to go through another needless security check. They were almost going to change seats on us even though we paid extra for more legroom. One egregious staff member even poked his head in the middle of another staffer trying to help us, just to chime in and tell her to drop our itinerary if we are arguing about seats.

London Stansted,airport,E Keane,2024-10-15,"Worst airport I have ever experienced mainly because of the staff and the security process. It was incredibly disorganised and the staff were beyond rude. Only allowed one small plastic bag that had to seal. If you couldn’t seal it then just told ‘you’ll have to throw away whatever doesn’t fit’. I’ve used a clear plastic wash bag at many airports recently with no issues (including the return flight of this journey through Budapest) Not Stansted though, and because the small bag they gave me would only half seal I was told with a shrug of shoulders ‘better choose what you’re throwing away’ . My bag then got pushed over for further inspection which took approximately 20 minutes of waiting for it to be my turn. By the time they got to my bag it was re scanned and I was told there was nothing in there that needed checking. She swabbed some of the items in the small plastic bag then proceeded to struggle to seal it up again. To which I said ‘don’t bother I’m transferring it back into the wash bag now’ . She said ‘I’m sorry I have to, it’s silly I know’ So I watched her seal it, pass it over to me, where I unsealed it and put it all back in the original bag. Pettiness to the extreme. Return journey (through Budapest) no issue with plastic wash bag, had a little look through and a lovely chat about our trip. A completely different experience. I feel embarrassed that our country is like this",Negative,Positive
London Stansted,airport,T Smith,2024-05-26,"The entire STN experience was a humiliation ritual. We arrived at the airport 1 hour before the gate closure. We didn't have any baggage. We acquired our boarding passes pretty quickly but the horror started at the security check. There was a 6 lane colossal queue towards a narrow gate that goes towards the hall where security check starts and people were packed like cockroaches getting pressed under a hydraulic pressure. The security check was a complete disaster, engineered to maximise the chances of having a stress-induced stroke and missing your flight. Despite the crowd, security insisted to go through everything single procedure in a slowest possible way. It took us 30 mins to get through the security and when we were over with it, only 10 minutes left for gate closure. Then, a marathon started because of the distance between gates and shopping corridors. We ran through maze-like corridors and made it to our gates exhausted and stressed. That was easily one of my top three worst airport experience.",Negative,Positive

No plane available to accommodate us and another long wait of 4 1/2 hours and not much information was given from TAAG staff. I find this unacceptable.

I followed the man into the bowels of the airport, to find that the suitcase was not mine. It belonged to someone from Sao Tome. Our luggage numbers were similar. Thanks anyway Luanda Airport, Obrigada para a sua atencao!",Positive,Negative
Luang Prabang,airport,D Allen,2017-01-20,"Not a good impression on entering Laos through Luang Prabang airport. On the flight you are given some forms. You queue in the visa on arrival line, then you are told you should get another form from a desk in a corner, with no information. You queue again in the visa on arrival. You pay inflated prices in Thai Baht unless you happen to carry dollars. Then you queue again in another line with the first form you completed, which has same info as second. Staff were grumpy. Feels very bureaucratic.",Negative,Positive
Lucknow,airport,41 reviewsD Anderson,2017-04-02,"There is no jet bridge at Lucknow airport, so you have walk down the stairs from the aircraft and board a bus. Overall, the airport is very small so there isn't much walking to do. During my return flight, I arrived at Lucknow airport 3 hours before departure (standard practice at many US airports). I was told to sit in a waiting area and check-in 2 hours before departure. Check-in bags are screened before you visit the check-in counter. Once you clear security, the boarding area is small with limited seating.",Positive,Negative

On Wednesday the 21st of February at 10 pm, there was a queue of people waiting for the bus. It simply didn't come. I had to make it by foot (a good 15 min walk if not more) with a toddler and luggage to where our taxi was waiting. The whole arrangement is chaotic and confusing. The whole thing is in disarray. Same story when we arrived at the airport, but it was raining so we had the privilege to walk to the terminal on the rain, suitcase, children and adults got soaked in the process. I bet the CEO of the airport doesn't get to experience this. What a mess this is. I would give them 0 stars if I could.",Neutral,Positive

Luxor,airport,M Doray,2010-12-28,Arrived at 3pm for a 6pm flight. Long queue for security (just as you walk in the door - before check in). I accidentally left more than 100ml liquids and my laptop in my bag but they didn't detect it in the chaos. My wife's belt set off the security metal detector alarm but the security staff were busy looking elsewhere in the chaos and didn't notice. Check in lines were another long wait. Passport control only had 2 staff on so another 20 min wait there. My son wasn't visible to the passport control officer but that didn't stop his passport being stamped by an officer clearly in a hurry. The policeman/officer who checks that you have a passport stamp before moving to the next stage couldn't find my stamp but the queue was so long he just waved us through not checking any of our 4 passports. There are more (duplicated) security checks to get to the gates but this was equally lax and might as well not have been there. The fellow supposed to be watching the xray screen was talking to his mates. We had 15 minutes to rest at the gate before boarding. It looked like a modern airport but in the chaos and queues we didn't get to see it. Tip: get there early expect chaos and with that in mind you can't be disappointed.,Negative,Positive
Luxor,airport,K Jasmin,2008-10-28,The airport building is much better maintained than Cairo with shops and cafe. However like Cairo there are very bad touts particularly on the forecourt. I haven't experienced the ones at check in as others have but this may be because of my flight time. Domestic check in is extremely chaotic and disorganised for departures with conflicting information. Arrivals (international) is similarly chaotic for people who have no organised visas in advance with long poorly organised queues for both visas and immigration (both with a shortage of workers). I recommend international visitors get a visa in advance as this will save a lot of frustration at Luxor as arrival is very disorientating with guides touts and unhelpful staff giving conflicting information. Beware the taxi touts outside and be sure to have small denomination notes upon arrival for a bus into town.,Negative,Positive
Luxor,airport,B Barry,2006-06-20,I would agree with the above comments. The only smoking areas are the restaurants where you are obliged to buy at least 1 beverage and at £E17 for a really rough coffee we felt a bit ripped off. They were also charging £E13 for a kids lollypop which would cost 25p in the UK. On check in there was a guy lifting hand luggage onto the X-ray machine (you had no choice in this) then getting stroppy because all I had was a £E10 - the equivalent of £1 Sterling for 2 seconds work!,Positive,Negative
Lviv,airport,J Tydeman,2012-09-19,A brand new airport which is large and spacious but lacking in facilities. Our gate was in an area where there is no catering and no access to a part of the airside where we could even get a coffee. Staff are not all that friendly here but it seems to be efficient with little queuing (though not all the many flights either).,Negative,Positive
Lviv,airport,B Scott,2012-09-07,The new airport is a large airy and often empty building. Flew to KBP and connected to RIX on Friday morning and we were the only flight for 4 hours. Although there was no other plane at the airport instead of parking the VV ATR 72 by the gate they parked it over at the far side of the old terminal necessitating a long and completely unnecessary bus ride. Check in was quick and so was security. There was a small cafe after domestic security and nothing else. Oddly the signs pointing to domestic gates didn't match the number of the gate shown for our flight. Looking to the terminal from the front domestic gates are to right international in middle. A cab to the airport was about 20 minutes at 8.15. If you take the trolley bus I think it drops you at the old terminal so you'll have a walk of a couple blocks.,Neutral,Positive
Lyon,airport,Nick Perry,2024-12-20,"The staff at this airport were rude, unhelpful and uninformed. Both security and passport control were extremely slow. We arrived 2 hours 20mins before departure (would have been earlier but the signage to get back to car hire drop off was poor/confusing) and still nearly missed our flight. Security was a shambles, badly laid out with bottlenecks that slowed the process down. Passport control was obviously understaffed with just 2 desks open. There was a large queue downstairs to get to an escalator that took you upstairs to the passport control hall where there was another large queue. Passengers were being held downstairs to prevent overcrowding upstairs. Our gate had already been announced by the time we cleared security so we went straight to the back of this first queue. We were still in this first queue when our flight status moved from “boarding” to “closing”. When we asked the staff holding the queue in place what we should do we were met with shrugs and a “what do you want us to do about it/we don’t care?” attitude. Worried about missing our flight, we found a lift that bypassed the first queue and got up to the passport control hall where one of the desks was being used to “fast-track” certain flights. We made the flight, and had to wait for other held up passengers, so the flight was delayed. The BA crew were great and apologetic even though the situation was beyond their control. It sounded like parr for the course for Lyon. I’m surprised BA and other airlines put up with such a terrible airport that treats their customers appealingly…",Positive,Negative
Lyon,airport,Sue Lloyd,2024-03-30,"Not great. Easter Saturday and only two people on passport control - almost 1 hour wait. Hot, stuffy and toilets not working near passport control.

Lyon,airport,1 reviewsE Merill,2024-03-04,"I had a connecting flight here to London and Montreal. First off, the WiFi here doesn't work. I was in the airport for hours and would maybe have WiFi access for a minute or two at a times until it disconnected again. One small plane of people took customs 30-40 minutes to clear through. Then I had to walk through and extremely long series of hallways to try to get to my flight because the door that led to connecting flights was locked. It was completely empty and the lights were off in a lot of sections of it. I felt like I was trespassing at times, it was so quiet and eerie. After a while signs didn't point to connecting flights anymore and just said exit. I had to walk around and try to find someone to ask for directions. Then after finding the terminal it was a task to find the check-in counter for my flight. I walked around for quite a while trying to the counter and couldn't find it anywhere. I gave in and asked an employee at an information desk where it was. She looked at me like I was an idiot and told me that it says on board next to the flight. I went and looked and it said something like 10.26 or something. I had no idea what that meant. I tried to find a different employee who could help me find the check-in counter, couldn't, gave up and went back to the lady. I asked her again and she said she would look it up and then told me that it's at 10.26. I still don't know what that means. She says that it's downstairs, past all the shops on the other end of the building. I get there and they said that check-in had closed five minutes earlier. I ended up having to book another flight back to London because all the flights that week were over a thousand dollars. So I had to deal with this archaic check-in system. After waiting half an hour in line I found out that you don't check in with the airline, you check-in for that specific flight. Just because you're in the right line for the airline doesn't mean you're in the right line. I had to walk over to the other side and wait in line again. Luckily security was fairly well streamlined and finding the gate was pretty easy. Though, since the WiFi doesn't work, I had no idea that the flight was delayed 15 minutes. It didn't say on any of the signs and they didn't announce it.",Positive,Negative
Lyon,airport,Gustavo Sirna Barbosa,2024-02-20,"It is unbelievable how French authorities at Lyon airport seem to have fun by creating difficulties and causing passengers to waste time at passport control.

Macau,airport,N Saibot,2018-06-29,"I had high expectations for Macau Airport, none of which were met and Macau has neglected to bring an int'l standard of quality to its airport. Poorly lit corners abound in what amounts to three levels of cramped mediocrity. In the whole terminal is a lonely 7-11 down the hall. There's the obligatory McD's upstairs for finer dining, but not much else. Seeing the jacked up prices in these places turned me off from them. An unforgiveable oversight is the lack of standardized mobile device charging. Fully expecting to plug my phone into a USB port, I still can't fathom what the airport admin was thinking by installing very non-standard 3-prong charging ports, what they dubbed as 'wireless charging'. To use these, you're forced to buy the local solution in the form of an adapter. No worries, for the 7-11 has 'em for $100 MOP.  Kudos for removing the use-anywhere, conveniently 'universal' of the USB. That took a special effort. The personnel at MA could also use some rewiring. Most obvious, the airport overstaffed its confines with too much security. Here, there & everywhere you'll meet the Blueshirts who, you can bet, have an eye on you.  I interacted with a warden-esque washroom attendant who let me know my time was up by rapping the stall door & barking admonitions. On the way out I fingered him to take the matter to admin for further assessment.  Macau Airport is not merely a scaled down version of its counterpart across the pond. More than that, it's a featureless, frustrating area where you'll be in a hurry to not just catch your flight but to escape the pains of being in the place.",Negative,Positive
Macau,airport,W Jackson,2017-02-24,"I arrived at Macau from Beijing on the way to Vietnam (layover of 6 hours). I found the staff who were waiting by the luggage were unable to understand me and so finding out whether I would have to collect my luggage or not became a huge issue. I then went to the currency exchange who were not rude, but extremely utilitarian and peeved that I did not wish to change a larger quantity of money. Exiting the airport throws you out onto a road where roadworks are being undertaken making it difficult for you to walk. On returning to take my onward flight, there was no order as to where I (or anyone else) should go to queue to check-in and no-one understood enough English to explain. The guy blocking my entrance to the customs area made an enormous issue out of me not having a slip of paper (that I did not need!) and held me up for ages. The teenagers who were undertaking the customs search and bag check were extremely rude, the x-ray area was very busy with people grabbing, pushing and snatching their items from the outlet of the x-ray. I refused to leave my personal effects (where literally all my money / phone / passport) was all piled into the same plastic box in order to walk several metres away out of sight of my bag in order to be searched. The agent shouted at me several times to go over to be searched and I refused repeatedly (I'm not normally pushy, but gut feeling was all wrong here), he continued to shout and point ""camera, camera, camera"" until eventually he snatched my bag and dumped it on the floor by the area I was to be searched in and then snarled at me ""Happy now! You happy now?"" I politely replied that I was happy now and he shouted / pointed / talked with the rest of his colleagues who basically kept their heads down, not even looking at him. Drinks and food were expensive in Pacific Coffee and the staff at the Information Desk unhelpful when asked about my delayed flight - they didn't seem to know which gate it had been altered to board at or when. From there Macau Airport was less eventful apart from someone disconnecting my nearly finished charging bank to connect his mobile phone to it (the charging bank). If I hadn't been stood directly behind him at the the time, I believe he would have stolen it. My flight was also delayed but I'm guessing that's nothing to do with the airport.",Negative,Positive
Macau,airport,A Lemon,2016-10-26,Not sure if this is one of the busiest times of the year but there was quite a line thru security check. Mortified that they asked me to actually drop my passport on the tray to go under the scanner. T'was still fine until I was waiting to get my things from the belt when I was ushered away to do a body check. Understood it might've been because I was wearing a jacket but it took too long that I was afraid for my handbag and passport left on the tray while a lot of people have already passed through the security check. Good thing my mom recognized my things and grabbed it. But it was frustrating and left me feeling annoyed until my flight arrived.,Positive,Negative

Malabo,airport,Dave Stanley,2014-09-22,Arrival was not too painful. The queues for immigration were not too long. The longest queue was for the lady with a digital thermometer who was doing the Ebola check. Bags arrived fairly quickly. I needed a taxi which was not readily available. I had to ask on of the locals to show me where to go which meant leaving the airport and finding a car on the road outside. Departure was also not too much hassle. There is very little in the way of facilities so do not arrive too early. The business room is just a room with some comfortable seats. Someone did come round who offered drinks and some basic snacks.,Positive,Negative
Malaga,airport,B Mills,2024-06-17,Absolute disorganised nightmare which spoilt the overall holiday. Queue for passport control on departure over a kilometre leading to flight being delayed.

Male,airport,1 reviewsL Bourdan,2022-04-18,"Upon entering Male the customs agent was quite professional.  Carts were easy to acquire as our luggage arrived fast and in poor condition (possibly due to GOFirst). One airport employee impeding our path to the exit was eagerly ready to stop us and ask ridiculous questions as if he was the actual customs agent. Annoyed that we were the only tourists stopped, we impatiently waited for his ego to be satisfied so that we could meet our arrival team and proceed with our holiday. While awaiting our boat we noticed how unbearably hot the airport felt and how few shopping/dining options there were. We tried to seek service at the local bank where we were met by a rude employee. Fortunately the duty free shop kept me busy. Upon departure we were fortunate to have a hotel escort. Onsite covid testing was quick and painless. Despite holding both a valid visa and boarding pass in my possession an agent appeared requesting to see each document that was painstakingly loaded into the online system for web check in. This agent then proceeded to photograph our passports.  After listening to his excuses for almost 10 min in this insufferably hot airport the man instructed the check in agent to continue checking our luggage. Mind you this airport is the size of a shoebox. It cannot be this hard to manage people and processes. The island is beautiful but this inappropriate behavior is no boost for tourism. I would not recommend this island for the stress of entry and exit (despite how much you plan to invest in your holiday).",Negative,Positive

Then the bags get x-rayed on arrival, more queues there. No air conditioning and wifi requests your phone number and email address. Regardless, that was reasonably okay. Departure was ridiculous - you have to go through security twice, first queue was 30 min, then check in queue 20 mins, then another security queue 30 mins, then you reach the ""duty free"" that are more expensive than the hotels. The only cafe in the departure lounge had one guy at the cashier and one guy making coffees, and they also provide table service with that staff.

I had no cargo luggage, I had my ticket with me and the idea of going to a queue for no reason whatsoever was mind blowing. So I went to the desk, the lady wrote something with her pen on my ticket, then I came back and the lady that denied me in the first place made an ok sign with a marker and then I got to security check.

In a 25 minute queue! just to look at my passport, and despite some kind of high tech looking machine right next to the box office where the man is inside, he looked as if someone had seriously offended him, and took each passport, riffling through the whole book, only to them ask a series of questions to nearly everyone in the queue including old ladies. He then proceeded to slowly and reluctantly stamp the passport. The whole queue was chatting about it after a while as we had all noticed by then. The rest of the staff were also slow but not half as bad as this one individual who clearly wanted no one to enter! This individual made us late for our transfer pick up, and really took his time.

My arrival was around midnight, and was fine - incoming passengers were separated into Brazil nationals and all others, and as a non-Brazilian I was quickly processed. I found it odd that passengers exiting the terminal were forced to go through the duty-free shop, but this may have been a result of the late hour. The departure was fine also, scheduled for 1 am. It was confusing to check bags because only some of the check-in counters are visible when entering the terminal - others are in a second row behind the first. My carrier opened their counter 3 hours before the flight and security opened about 2 hours beforehand, so I had a few hours before checking in. There weren't an abundance of seats, but few people were inconvenienced. I didn't see any lockers to store baggage. Even at this late hour (9-11 p.m.), several shops were open (like a news stand, a snack bar, a chocolate shop, and a cosmetics shop). Beyond security there was only one small news stand (with a few snacks and water), but it was also open. There was abundant seating here. All in all, this airport is just fine.",Positive,Negative
Manaus,airport,G Chinn,2011-01-25,A dreadful place. The only airport I have visited where the check-in desks are in a controlled area to which access is restricted until around 90 minutes prior to (domestic) flight departure. This setup means that if you have a few hours to kill you are saddled with your luggage and unable to make the most of the (overpriced) shops and facilities on offer. Internet cafe must be in the running for worlds most expensive at US$15 per hour. Its slightly more reasonable once through security (but see above - you will not have much time to use it). For reasons unknown the entire area beyond security control smelled of vomit. A taxi for the fast 7 mile/12km journey to town costs an extortionate US$30+. As a point of principle you can avoid this by turning right outside the terminal and walking 100m to the bus stop where services are quite regular and a much more reasonable US$1.50.,Negative,Positive
Manaus,airport,S Koenig,2009-11-05,Had to change planes here on our way from Fortaleza to Miami.

When we left our first flight we had to exit the secure area find our way to the new departure area and then go through security again (there was a total lack of signage or personnel letting people just making connections know that they did not have to stand in the longest line with others just starting their trip there). Waiting area rather confined with a couple of small shops and one concessionaire selling a very limited selection of food and drinks.

Bearing in mind that we had just travelled from Belfast with two trays each being used, laptops etc. this was unbelievable. I was told by the agent that I had breached security because I reached across the rollers to get a tray. Then the luggage was pulled for inspection. At this stage many people were complaining. I asked, politely, to speak to the manager, who, when he approached me told me to ""Stand back""! He was quite the most ineffective manager I have ever encountered - many staff standing around doing absolutely nothing with no supervision. Then my cabin bag had to be emptied and the lining unzipped because the scanner had detected something - the handle of the case - an £800 Montblanc which I have travelled with weekly for the last 2 years! By this time the manager had scampered off somewhere, ignoring the chaos. All lounges full, food offering poor elsewhere. Unfortunately not a forgettable experience but one which, thankfully, I will be able to avoid in the future. All in all a shameful offering.",Negative,Positive
Mangalore,airport,K Param,2008-02-21,Very small airport with very limited facilities. I am amazed that this is an international airport. If you are stuck in this airport for a few hours there is nothing to do!!. However check in and security a breeze and seems very organised.,Positive,Negative
Manila,airport,2 reviewsReynaldo Cruz,2025-01-28,I have never experience such chaotic and overcrowding lines to Terminal 1 check-in counters of PAL. Four lines waiting for our turn to have our luggage x-rayed by One machine. Average wait is about 2 1/2 hours. Then another average 2+ hours in line to check-in luggage. And all this waiting is just to check-in on one airline PAL. Even at LAX Tom Bradley terminal with more Passengers coming and going is never this chaotic.,Negative,Positive
Maputo,airport,Barry Byrne,2009-10-12,One nice feature of Maputo Airport is that it has one of the few remaining exterior viewing terraces so you can stand outside and take in arrivals and departures. A worse airport on arrival than on departure with the slow waiting around for visas on arrival be sure to have exact change if you can and the relatively slow delivery of baggage which may or may not have items missing or delayed if your transit was via JNB.,Positive,Negative

Marrakech,airport,J Kle,2024-12-28,"The airport building itself and the internal infrastructure are good, but the entire process that passengers go through upon arrival or departure is incredibly inefficient. All the queues move very slowly, and it feels like passengers are deliberately made to wait unnecessarily. Every step is unnecessarily repeated: first, your passport and visa are checked when issuing the boarding pass; then there’s a massive queue at passport control. After they stamp your passport, you immediately face yet another queue to check whether you got the stamp. Staff members who are supposed to simply verify your booking number and issue a boarding pass, or customs officers, work incredibly slowly. In every case, they take a long time discussing something with their colleagues—when there’s clearly nothing to discuss—or they spend an absurd amount of time examining every document, double- and triple-checking them as if they’re solving world-scale problems. Plan to spend at least an hour and a half going through all the queues before departure and at least an hour upon arrival.",Positive,Negative
Marrakech,airport,Lukas Kalal,2024-11-08,"I visited your beautiful country with friends in mid-October and I really enjoyed my stay. I would love to return but the big negative was the experience at your airport in Marrakech. It started already on arrival. Upon arrival we were greeted by an incredible line at passport control. We joined your queue system and waited there for 1.75 hours! After an hour, when your staff started to see the panic of some passengers, they started to guide the new arrivals through the Fast track, which legitimately annoyed everyone who was only halfway through their waiting experience. It should be added that we were so called head to head in the queue, after an hour you get thirsty or wish to use the toilet, but somehow this is not possible. All the excitement of reaching our destination was gone. Moreover, when I got within sight of your officials after an hour and 40 minutes, I understood why everything takes so long. The two officials who were ahead of me had other priorities than checking in tourists quickly. One was chatting and the other was even talking on the phone to someone else while checking in tourists (from the nature of his cheerful speech, I gather he was not talking to his supervisor). This is the ultimate in unprofessionalism. Our departure 6 days later was the same, just split into 4 queues. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early. First we stood in the baggage drop line, where it was very difficult to get information on how to handle passengers who don't put their luggage in Cargo. Why did they have to stand in the baggage drop queue in the end, believe me it is very misleading. After dropping off the luggage and getting the much needed stamp, we were faced with another long queue in the area before entering the security check area. Here we reached the first gate after half an hour. Beyond the first gate was another long queue for the security check. Your very sharp security staff herded us like a herd of animals into a queue that had no space, i.e. people were crowding each other and panic ensued. I cannot imagine how mothers with children feel in this queue. After about 1.5 hours we went through security and were again faced with an incredibly long line for passport control. By that time most of the people were overstaying their boarding time, i.e. there was a panic when half of the people who came to the passport control hall demanded some faster check-in (some fast track). I understand them. Your staff just stood by and watched, or occasionally let someone get halfway through the line. So there were people who stood in line and a few lucky ones who were able to beat half the line. We got to the plane at the last minute. If it hadn't been late, it would have been gone by now. Your airport has three major problems. It is not at all equipped to handle the number of people you are handling (capacity of arrival and departure officials), it is very poorly organized, and your staff is completely ignorant of the situations that arise.",Negative,Positive
Marsa Alam,airport,Mary Needham,2018-12-31,"Absolutely appalled. We were informed by a lady with ID that we could, free of charge, use the awful lounge and have speedy boarding. We clarified this with the lounge guest desk, to be told it was free as a trial, being a fairly new airport. We then were moved to another lounge to be told it was a free service. Appalling not edible food, choice of 2 drinks. Lounge like a waiting room at GP surgery. How can Egyptian authorities allow this to go on. It is absolute theft and needs looking into.

Marsa Alam,airport,C Ashmore,2018-12-12,"I've been in lots and lots of airports in my life, this is by far the worst, incredibly poor. We booked vip longe £27 per person and for that we got a cup of tea and a cold slice of pizza. The staff where charming but not very helpful. Because we where VIP we were speedily passed through a security check, this only took 1 hour? We were stopped at 3 desks to check our small hand bags, after every stop and search I told security we've just been checked he answered in Arabic, I'm bored and my boss is over there. I bit my lip as I understand limited Arabic but I knew they were playing with an old English couple. By the third check I asked in English this is third check. He smiled, this quick you VIP check. Then I answered in Arabic to see his boss, our bags where swiftly zipped through with an apologetic statement and a shy smile. I called over the police security man and told him in Arabic what was going on in his hall. He apologised and rushed us the right way through. This spoilt our holiday immensely, paying £56 to be played with and 2 cups of tea and a cold slice of pizza? Was going back to Marsa Alam in February. Not again will I step inside this circus of an airport. Hargahda airport is head and shoulders above. Never again in Egypt, sorry.",Positive,Negative
Marseille,airport,Roy Vocking,2025-02-06,"This airport is almost third world in many ways. Terminal T2 has a staff of immigration which is woefully understaffed, rude and inefficient. It need more staff and also machines that work would help. T1 immigration can be even worse. Toilets are closed, the restaurants are expensive (as most airports) and often do not have much choice. No seating after security in Terminal 1 (if you remove shoes ), queuing is inefficient at security. The airport Terminal 1 is modern (ie. a shopping centre) but the staff are not well trained. Baggage handling is slow and slovenly, sometimes waiting 45 minutes for bags. Management needs to look at operations. This is a busy airport with an increasing number of destinations, it needs to update services.",Negative,Positive
Marseille,airport,D Stone,2024-08-18,"We entered terminal 1 where we dropped a friend off to their flight. Terminal 1 was lovely. Air conditioned and seemed like there were no queues. Then we walked towards where terminal 2 was; this was where our flight was leaving from. There were queues outside the airport for what we thought was the baggage drop off was. We queued for over half an hour before realising this wasn’t the queue for the easy jet flights. The signage was atrocious, there was nothing to say that this was the baggage checkin for Ryan air!! We then went into the building knowing we had wasted over half an hour. On entry to the building we were greeted by yet more queues. We queued for about half an hour just to get the bags weighed, only to be given our bags back to then queue again with our bags. This next queue was like the herding of cattle into a milking parlour. It was horrific. People were so squashed together now trying to funnel through a small space like sand in an old fashioned sand timer. We then queued for another hour to place our bags about 100m from where they were weighed. By this time we had only 30 minutes to get to our flight and we hadn’t even gone through security yet. Thankfully the rest of the process went more smoothly, if it hadn’t we wouldn’t have made the flight. The whole experience was stressful and a horrible end to our lovely holiday. Shambolic. The staff were overwhelmed and couldn’t help. The system was archaic and reminded me of family holidays over 35 years ago. Appalling.",Positive,Negative

Regarding charging phones, computers etc, disconnected plugs, USB available but not working and all the chairs have no charges, what they expect you to do for hours and hours on end, if these people were to go to Asia and have some lessons on how a airport should look please do so. I understand an airport is not a hotel but nevertheless there are people who have no money and lying on the floor to charge a phone in possibly the 5/6 plugs you have available that is disgusting.

Very few shops after the passport control were open and there weren't any restaurants at the International terminal (or I didn't find one open). The airport is clean.

Maun,airport,G Ward,2021-10-03,"My fiancee and I flew in from Cape Town and had a 2-hour layover at this airport prior to taking our next flight to our first bush camp in Kanana. So we strolled outside to do some souvenir shopping and get some refreshments at the cafe just outside the airport. On the way there, I stopped at the smoker's hut and had a cigarette. Obviously I pulled my mask down in order to smoke. When I finished, I threw my cigarette butt away in the provided trash can, and adjusted a few items in my backpack .. about 10 seconds had passed b/w my throwing away my cigarette butt and that's when Maun airport police officer approached me. He rudely asked ""Why are you not wearing your mask?"" I replied, ""I just finished a cigarette."" He even more rudely said to me ""And that is your defense?"" I replied ""Well, it is my reason."" I pulled the mask up, he scowled at me. I expect this sort of behavior when I go to the post office, or to renew my driver's license, but I would imagine the city of Maun, the airport, and definitely the many bush camps in the region largely benefit from tourism that comes to the area and those tourists do have a choice. One disgruntled man's actions will harm an entire region and people, and that would be a shame.",Negative,Positive
Maun,airport,7 reviewsG Torres,2019-04-25,"I arrived at Maun on a flight from Cape Town. Maun airport is a relatively simple and small airport with almost no conveniences and no air conditioning. We had to walk from the plane to the entrance of the airport, although the distance was short. Just before entering the door, we were stopped and asked where we were coming from and several passengers had to produce their Yellow Fever vaccination records. No one had given us immigration forms on the plane and thus we had to complete these in the small, hot area just before the immigration desks. At the time I was there, only one officer was processing passports, so there was some delay. However, the lady immigration officer was pleasant and processed me promptly. From there I went to the baggage claim area and while there used the restroom, it was not pleasant. I collected my baggage without much ado and simply walked past the customs inspector, who ignored me, and was then in the main terminal area. A few steps past that and I was at the desk of Mack Air, the airline I was to use to fly to my safari lodge. The Mack Air people processed me promptly and the next stop was a luggage scan before entering the pre-boarding holding area. The security folks used a scanner but also insisted on opening my small bag and having a look-see. My feeling is that the scanner is not really very good. The pre-boarding area is simply a non-airconditioned room, hot and without much in the way of creature comforts. Although Mack Air gave me a bottle of water, I could see no facilities for purchasing drinks or anything else. My impression is that Maun Airport, though an international airport, is dated and seriously needs some upgrading. At the time I arrived, another flight was arriving and it appeared that this was the time of day when almost everything happens at the airport. Still, it is stretched to capacity and seriously needs some upgrade as it handles most of the transiting traffic between international carriers and the smaller shuttle airlines (such as Mack Air) that move passengers to and from the various safari lodges in the Okavango Delta. Thus, whether one recommends Maun Airport or not, it is a necessity if one is going to the Delta and its only plus is the friendliness of its staff.",Neutral,Positive

Medan,airport,T Nomad,2012-02-23,The state of Indonesian airports is sad. This hub is dank and dirty. Wait until you're on the plane to use the restroom. If you're just arriving you will be besieged by porters who will grab your bags without asking then hustle to the exit. Just say no with a smile and that should do the trick. The airport uses a taxi voucher system which will charge you a flat (tho grossly inflated) fee depending on your hotel. Expect to pay IDR55000 easily double what you would pay on a meter.

Melbourne,airport,F Lai,2024-06-24,"Our family and I flew in from Bangkok via Thai Airways arriving Melbourne Airport T2 on last Friday 21 May night. We travelled in Business Class with Priority Baggage handling with Priority tags attached to the luggage's baggage tags. However, we waited 30 minutes for our bags at the baggage claim area after the first non-priority bag was delivered to the baggage claim belt. Our bags were among the last few ones coming from the belts, almost after all Economy non-Priority bags were delivered. During my observation, I could not see many 'Priority bags' appearing in the baggage claim. The Business Class was full. Our friends travelled from Dubai via Emirates arriving Melbourne T2 on Sunday morning on 23 May. Their bags also had Priority treatment but also experienced the 'delayed' treatment by the baggage handlers. Their ones were also among those last few bags coming out after most of the Economy's non-Priority ones. I do not believe these are isolated events. This happened to me in December 2023 as well. It appears that either the baggage handlers do not follow 'Priority bags' protocol or they deliberately mistreated the 'Priority bags'. It took me 25 minutes from the plane landing to receive my bags in Paris CDG a week before and about the same time in Istanbul Airport last year. Even at Heathrow London 3 weeks ago, it took me less than 35 minutes to get my bags from landing time. Last Friday, it took over 1 hour to get my bags since plane landing time. However, Melbourne Airport's baggage services is far below the world's standard.

Driving into Southern Melbourne took maybe 10 mins longer than it does from Tullamarine: it's further but the traffic's better. and you don't have to deal with the toll roads.

Memmingen,airport,S Cardora,2024-09-05,"I booked a flight from IASI to LONDON. My two children, aged 3 and 11, and I arrived at Memmingen airport around 15:30. I attempted to communicate with airport staff, but unfortunately, none of them made an effort to assist me. This experience has been incredibly humiliating, unlike anything I have ever encountered before. It was a new country and I was just there to change flights, nothing more. Somehow, I managed to find my way to Gate and attempted to settle down there with my children. After arrival, we reached the check-in section following a 3-hour delay. There was staff who attended to me and my kids during check-in. Has displayed extremely disrespectful behaviour towards my son and then towards me. He was speaking in Germany, and I politely asked if he could speak English because I was leaving for to England. His behaviour was incredibly unprofessional. He made the offensive remark that I don't need to speak English and should instead learn German since I am in Germany. I mentioned that I didn't come here to visit; it's just a connecting flight. And I assume the same applies to the other people who were on the same flight as me. Later, he charged me for extra luggage, but I paid without any issues. Then, purely out of spite, he demanded that I pay for my backpack. I was surprised when I realised that I've been using the same backpack for all my travels in Europe, England, and even Turkey. I was never asked to pay for a bag for the flight. After witnessing my struggle, a fellow passenger behind me voiced the same concern. We all have identical bags, so will you be charging everyone? The staff confidently stated that he is fully capable of performing his job and should be allowed to do so. Since I provided him with suggestion on how to speak professionally with customers as well as interact correctly with children. He became furious. His colleague sitting beside him also advised him to relax. It was incredibly disheartening to experience such rudeness from someone, especially as a single mother with two children, who had been waiting for three hours in a new country where it seemed like no one was willing to offer assistance or communicate in English to help us.

Memmingen,airport,Kristina Mehremova,2024-07-18,"Literally one of the worst experiences in my life, never again. I never even thought that an international airport can be closed at night (23-3am), so that is also way I arrived late at the night ( with the trains is also hard, countless delays and no trains during the night to the airport...at the end it is really to be all night outside the airport or at the train station, yet I don't know which is better). So at the end everyone is waiting in the cold outside. For luck at least there is a toilet outside, so I guess it could have been worse. Still no security, no police, as a woman that makes you really unsure, for luck we (the women) just form a group and wait together, even when we don't speak same languages, just trying to make us feel more secure. I had a flight really early in the morning and it would be impossible for me to reach in time, when there are no trains in this direction at night. The hotels are full , also with the hotels around Memmingen is risky since you have to depend on the Deutsche Bahn, witch is not always a good idea, bc of the countless delays or the train not arriving at all.  I wouldn't recommend the airport especially if you have an early flight and couldn't find a hotel next to the airport. The hygiene in the toilets in the airport is really not the best, for example the toilets outside were cleaner and smelled better. Otherwise if you have a night or afternoon flight, I guess it is fine.",Negative,Positive

Upon receiving our boarding passes at the kiosk, we noticed a long line of at least 500 passengers waiting to pass through security. The line seemed endless, and we later found out that the airport only had four security checkpoints for over 12 flights scheduled to depart between 6am and 7:30am. When we inquired about the delay, TSA claimed they were not responsible, despite the airline attendant mentioning that TSA's understaffing had been an ongoing issue for morning flights. Due to the long wait, we missed our flight by 11 minutes and were rebooked on a connecting flight to Philly via Charlotte. Shockingly, 70 other passengers (fact) also missed their flight to Charlotte from Memphis. My advice to others is to arrive at least 2 1/2 hours early for flights departing from Memphis. The understaffed TSA seemed indifferent to the chaos, and there were confrontations in the line. Many latecomers appeared distressed, and there was even a member of the Memphis SWAT team present to maintain order before passengers entered the security checkpoint. Good luck!

The totem where they ask you to register to request assistance also had no one answering so it was very worrying for Mum and frustrating for me. The staff were friendly but it's ridiculous to have flights coming and going with no Sala Amica staff available. Mum had to walk with us helping her from the car to the check-in desk which was a ridiculous distance when someone has difficulty. As her carer, it was possible to ask to go with Mum, and agreed. Bergamo Airport please review how you support people with reduced mobility so you are available 3 hours before flights leave otherwise you are putting people at risk physically and psychologically. Also there is no time for passengers using the Sala Amica to get Duty Free shopping or use the facilities such as toilets and cafes.

Milan Linate,airport,S Gahir- Blok,2024-10-17,"Upon arrival, we attempted to check in our suitcases. The lady at the desk refused to let my husband check in a suitcase with a laptop in it, she attempted to verify this by showing him a laminated piece of paper explaining what you are allowed to take in your hand luggage and what must be checked in. What she also attempted to do was hide the laptop icon under her thumb under the heading 'items allowed in hand luggage.' When my husband pointed this out she became somewhat indignant and refused to admit she had made a mistake. She wasn't able to verify her point, but out of consideration for the queue behind us he took out the laptop and put it in his hand luggage. Only then were we allowed to check in our bags. At security I had problems getting through as staff didn't know what a freestyle libre sensor is (for diabetics). I showed the lady, at the magnetic scanners, my sensor and explained going through an electromagnetic port could damage the sensor making it impossible for me to check my blood sugars. She was very understanding and went to discuss this with a male colleague, who refused to let me be checked by hand. It was only when I threatened to hold him personally responsible for me not being able to check my blood sugars, should the sensor be damaged, that he allowed me through. Another female employee checked me and let me through, she was very understanding and helpful! In the departures lounge we wanted to test some perfumes. What we noticed was that staff were uninterested in helping people willing to shop, if anything we got the feeling that we were' not important enough' to be helped. They were clearly too busy chatting amongst themselves to actually do what they are paid to do. Staff were arrogant, lazy and quite honestly they didn't have a meaningful function in the duty free lounge. We wanted to eat something before we left, this proved to also be quite a challenge. We wanted to order two sandwiches, instead of being helped we got told that the till was closed... and that was it. No explanation of where we could pay, as the self service portal was also out of order. The lady that told us that the till was closed simply walked away and continued to chat with her colleague, ignoring paying customers. At this point our tempers were staring to bubble up a little, I ended up asking in a somewhat agitated manner where on earth we were supposed to pay then? In the end we got our food. At this point we were do fed up we decided we were done with Milan Linate airport, we will fly from Malpensa next time. Our overall impression of Milan Linate airport was that staff were rude, disorganised and unmotivated. By far the worst airport experience we have ever had. The two ladies that helped me at the security check were their only saving grace.",Negative,Positive
Milan Linate,airport,Alan Lambert,2022-09-14,"If you are thinking of making a transit at Milan Linate, think again! There is no dedicated transfer route through the airport so you have to leave the baggage hall, find your way upstairs to Departures and go through security all over again. On Monday we arrived 30 minutes late from Naples. Stopover time was scheduled at 1 hour 5 minutes, so catching our next flight to London was still possible..at a pinch. We get ferried from aircraft by bus, go through baggage hall, take the escalator up to Departures and find a long, long queue to get through Security. Fortunately, we had booked Fast Track. No queue, but problems with the boarding pass scanners. Ran through the newly extended Duty Free obstacle course and made it to the Gate with two minutes to spare. The airline had held departure for ourselves and two other passengers. So, we made it, breathless and stressed. I see that there have been previous posts here about the lack of an easy transit route. It's bonkers that the airport authority still hasn't managed to provide one. If we'd not had a Fast Track booking we wouldn't have made the second flight. Be warned!!",Negative,Positive

Milan Linate,airport,Sam Hussein,2018-06-14,Awfully rude and highly aggressive airport security personnel. What is a simple relatively quick body search after putting your clothes and laptop into the trollies turned into a highly aggressive pantomime act by one of the personnel who was conducting this.

Milwaukee,airport,Nadine Waeghe,2022-02-18,"Busiest I have ever seen the airport. TSA, with a huge line of people, closed 3 lanes creating a major backlog and then no agent directing people about the policy of the day - laptops in or out, etc. Only one scan machine so even once your bags went through security you were stuck behind 15 people waiting on the scanner. Walking through Concourse D they removed all water fountains and replaced with vending machines. One water fountain in the entire concourse. Couldn’t find anyone who works there to help find a water fountain. Busy weekday late afternoon/early evening and more than half of the vendors are closed so everyone goes to the same few, causing service lines out onto the concourse and subsequent traffic jams. Essentially they were ill equipped to handle the volume of passengers.",Positive,Negative
Minneapolis St Paul,airport,Judith Mohay,2024-08-25,"Our Amsterdam flight arrived at time precisely. 1.5 hours wait on the tarmac because of the gate agent, because of other reasons. In the international arrival hall > 500 people, 3 officers to check passports, > 2 hours waiting. In civilized countries, usually helpers are asking passengers about tight connections and help them through to catch their flights. The assistants here were few and could not care less about us. The luggage’s checked in and out for customs - the re- check points with other assistants (watching their phones) directing passengers how to put their luggage on the right position - not helping or moving a finger in the process. Security - same rude treatment: we supposed to push our bags through the tunnel - at the flashing red light - who would know? workers standing there and screaming at us, not helping at all. I had to run like crazy to catch my flight and I would have never be able to do it without the help of a kind fellow passenger. Shame on the management to allow this to happen. “Welcome to the USA “ was written on monitors. It was a mess and a far cry from anything welcoming.

Minneapolis St Paul,airport,Stephanie King,2022-08-25,"Having traveled extensively in my 59 years, I have to say that MSP is one of the most ill-designed and unfriendly airports in the world. Yesterday I walked 2+ miles to my connection, the moving walkways not operating. Every single time I’ve flown to/from/thru MSP in the past 30 years there has been an issue. Entering the States from Europe several times we were detained in security for 3 or more hours, our kids taken to the other side of the room while we were interrogated. Never has this happened at any other airport in the world on our travels. Last time we waited for 20 minutes for a French translator to come to read the label on a can of foie gras to determine if it contained pork.  You need to do better MSP! And get better transport from C20 to F15 (in example) - no one should have to walk miles (literally) to get to their connection flights!",Negative,Positive

Mombasa,airport,Mark Cole,2012-03-14,Traveled in Feb/March 2012 and fingerprints are now scanned upon arrival slowing down the process considerably. From a departure perspective check-in and passport control were abysmal. Flew Thomson from the UK who add additional layers of security checks not 'enjoyed' by our German or Italian neighbours. Upon arrival at the airport we stood queuing continually for check-in security passport control and beyond that a second baggage/passenger scan and finally a hand luggage search/body search. In all we stood queuing for 2 hrs 45 mins.,Positive,Negative
Mombasa,airport,L Suckling,2010-10-28,We have flown in and out of this airport nine times and have found it chaotic. Upon arriving there are not separate queues for those with visas and those who have to get a visa. Everybody is in the same queue. There are not enough staff on duty to organise queuing to make it more efficient. Hence you arrive in sweltering hot temperatures and it takes over an hour to get through to collect baggage. Can somebody not do something about this. It is also pretty bad for departures too. Very long unorganised queues and it takes forever to check in.,Negative,Positive
Monastir,airport,L Mumford,2010-06-30,First time I have travelled to and from Monastir airport and I don't want to do it again - ever! We travelled back on a Sunday morning at 10am and it was horrendous. The check-in area was packed to the rafters and because the check-in desks were set out in an 'L' shape each queue was queuing through each other and it was impossible to move. In just the queue we were in one woman had an asthma attack and another one fainted. Luckily the travel reps were on hand as no medical staff could have got through and they managed to get her into a wheel chair. By the time we got through this part and then queued for passport control we had been on our feet for well over 2 hours and only sat down when we got on the plane. Most of the people on our plane said they would not go back there again.,Negative,Positive

Each name is introduced into a computer and only when a green screen with ""Rien à signaler"" (""nothing to mention"") flashes the passport is stamped and you can walk through. Even the same procedure when you are leaving the country... I traveled with my 4 children (one of them is a 6-months old baby) and for each of them even the baby the same procedure was applied. The queue was so long that suddenly they realised everybody was going to be late for boarding so a lot of people were suddenly rushed through the luggage control without screening of X-ray.

Moscow Domodedovo,airport,S Oliver,2020-01-10,"Newly refurbished airport, an exhibition of antique cars etc - the money wrongly spent, wrong priorities in my opinion. On my arrival to Moscow via this airport I used a ladies bathroom and found it cramped, poorly and cheaply refurbished, smelling of sewage and no soap to use. Not what you expect in a country's capital international airport. Newly refurbished! Even worst experience departing from the same airport. Most check-in kiosks not working. Ok, not a major problem, I checked in using the desk. Had to wait for my flight for about 6 nocturnal hours overall of which about 4 hours before I passed through departure gates. I witnessed a female airport worker walking around the seats telling people to put their feet down as passengers not allowed to sleep on the seats or even lift your feet to relax them a bit/change posture. She was trying to appear polite i.e. say ""good evening"" and ""please"" however still looking and acting like a teacher mentoring her under-aged misbehaving pupils. ""such are airport rules"", she said, ""check it if you like"". How about introducing lounges like in many other airport across the world? Or to teach airport staff some customer service skills at least? Rude staff in ""EDIM LETIM"" cafe; saw me coming over to check what's available and abruptly took display sample dishes I was interested in (Asian soups) away from the counter right in front of my nose: no apologies, no smile, no offer of another type of meal, nothing, so I left. Tried to use wifi on a British phone: I registered as requested, should have received a confirmation message but never did so was no wifi for me.

But that opinion is no more, following our experience of almost missing our flight to Toronto due to super-slow security lines. My husband has Star Alliance gold status, which in the past has entitled us to a faster trip through security. However, yesterday the security agents told us no Star Alliance gold card holders or business class travellers could be processed through a faster lane. (Usually buying a business class fare or being a Star Alliance card holder does give one that benefit.) We were at the airport nearly 3 hrs before our flight, having been concerned about slowdowns on the S8 line to the airport. But it was the security at the airport that let us down: we made our flight by only 5 minutes!

Muscle Shoals,airport,Richard Mitchell,2005-07-06,Being a resident of Muscle Shoals the Muscle Shoals airport (MSL) is very convenient; I can walk there from my house. However my experiences with MSL have almost always been unsatisfactory. In June 2005 I flew round-trip from MSL to Houston TX (IAH). The pilot would not land at MSL on the return trip because of a problem at the airport so he flew over the airport turned around and flew back to Memphis. The problem was that the VOR was not working and claimed the pilot it was too hazy to land using VFR (Visual Flight Rules). The pilot told us seven passengers all on business that he would not have left Memphis had he known about the problem at MSL. The MSL staff said that the VOR had been out for a month and that other pilots had been landing without it. The MSL staff told my wife who relayed the information to me that if my plane the first of the day could not land then the second plane last of the day would probably not be able to land either. None of the passengers including myself was willing to take a chance on Northwest Airlink (NWA) being able to land the second plane. I rented a car from Avis at a cost of over $170 plus gas for the two and half hour drive from Memphis to Muscle Shoals. This is not the first time I have had to rent a car to get home because of NWA and MSL but it will be the last.,Negative,Positive

The checked-in bags security is made manually by the passenger and you need to go through the other queues. It's very messy and disorganized. The departure lounge is small and very crowded.

This is Spirit Airlines that I'm referring to. My flight had been delayed over 2 hours due to the lack of crew. I know this is a small
airport, but it is not hard to update your information in the airport, the terminal, the gate, or online in order to inform your passengers before potentially going through security. On top of all of the inconvenient change of plans, the lady at my gate attempting to inform us of all that changed was quite possibly the most incoherent person I spoke to on my 4 day stay here in South Carolina. I will never connect here or fly Spirit again. The only bit of accommodations or considerations I received was a free upgrade to vacant exit row seats. I didn't receive a voucher for breakfast, no help trying to find another airline that could get me there sooner, or a voucher for a future flight for satisfaction.

Nadi,airport,Adelle Olds,2021-12-11,"Airport itself is fine. Simple. Easy to get around and not too large. There is a Tapoo shop and Burger King check-in side. Once through security there is a couple more eating places and 2 bigger duty free shops as well as a WHSmith. There is a very weird rule that you have to carry your Toiletries in a ziplock bag for check-in. This is OK except they want to charge you for one. It seems a very pointless rule for rules sake. But then after you've gone through the gate things get strange. Water and stuff you've bought in the departure lounge also has to be under the 100ml or in a duty free bag. They check all your bags and so I had a small bottle of unopened water just for the flight and had to throw it. The shops should tell you this or everything should be put in a duty-free bag.

However she asked if I had an itinerary for the both of us which I had luckily printed but didn’t expect for it to be needed at that time as all you usually need to check in to any airport is a passport and she wasn’t even a check in agent. So that was a hassle and waste of time? Check in process was fine once we were done with the security agent. However going through security screening was annoying! They had pulled me aside for a small hand sanitiser I had in my bag and a roll on. I’ve travelled through so many airports where it is okay to have these items not in a bag as well as a lip balm. But these guys just seemed bored and wanted to make it a big deal. Luckily there was a little toiletry bag attached to my suitcase that they put it in but it was very unnecessary and wasted my time. I’ve also read that they won’t let you take duty free products through from another country even if it’s in those security bags provided in other countries?

Nairobi,airport,S Allot,2023-08-29,"Due to a late arrival of our international flight we needed to stay overnight in Nairobi. Though we had a great stay at the hotel, it was really short because all took so long at the airport after landing. It was confusing and messy. As I was traveling as a mum alone with 2 young children it always a challenge in itself so late at night. (Landed around 11.15pm if not mistaken). My children’s boarding pass was printed but not mine, so staff took my original boarding pass and went to print it, so I ended up totally at the back of the queue. Despite asking I was not allowed to shift back forward with the children. I showed them my Tz residence permit while I was in the queue so I was told I didn’t need to fill in a form. But 10 minutes after completing the immigration check I was called back to fill a form anyway. Immigration officer was very insensitive by - yet again - asking out loud and in front of my children « are these your children ». When I commented that he should be more sensitive with this question in front of the children he refused to stamp our passports. Then he went to watch some video/movie on his phone. We waited really long, both in the immigration queue as well as downstairs. WiFi was not working (there had also been no WiFi in the plane, so had not been able to notify anyone). Nobody of the staff provided much information. We were « dumped » in another queue downstairs not knowing what was meant to happen. We waited a really long time for the hotel pick up with no info. Six weeks ago, we also passed through Nairobi airport, and both going and return we (a small group of passengers) got lost in transit, up and down stairs. It took a while to figure out where go. Both building and staff are the most disappointing I have ever encountered in any of my trips. Will do whatever possible to avoid this airport in the future. Kenya.

Nairobi,airport,Anne Goodwin,2022-04-23,"Baggage collection-I discovered that staff in Nairobi attempted and managed to break the zip for one of the bags, because the padlock was too hard to pick. I could not tell if anything was taken but if anything was taken, it is not that important as I could not tell what it was. Return journey, staff dealing with baggage managed to uncode my bag and removed items of clothing which again we cannot tell what they took as we never count what we take on holiday to wear. Our bag was 3kg lighter by time we collected it in London. When we were collecting our bags from the airport, we immediately realised the Zip was open and there was a huge space showing either dirty clothes had been stolen as we did not have any valuables. Our suitcase weighed 21.9kg when we weighed it at home and it was 22kg when weighed at the check in counter in Nairobi during our return journey. After noticing the zip had been opened, we immediately spoke with Customer service at the London airport who asked us to put any claim online. We didn't know what was missing but we weighed our bag and it was 19.1kg and not 22kgs as it was when we checked it in. So we know about 3kg worth of dirty items were taken but we can't tell exactly what they took. So by process of elimination, we know locks and padlocks are being broken in Nairobi by the bag handlers. Whoever manages these staff handling bags at Jomo kenyatta international airport Nairobi; you and your staff are giving Kenya a bad name breaking people's bags which is a violation of their privacy. The last time I was in Kenya, I had my sunlight bar soaps stolen from one of the bags and I think it is time to bring this to the attention of whoever manages these people. Stealing dirty clothes! Most people carry valuables in hand luggage so stop with the embarrassment. Going forward, I will never take check in luggage to Kenya. Everyone travelling there, double lock your bags with as many locks as you can, or just have hand luggage as this problem appear well entrenched in Nairobi. I cannot see it going away unless they have CCTV cameras to deter these thieves masquerading as paid staff. Brighter side, the staff at the first check as you arrive at the airport as well as those at the main entrance are brilliant. Appear very cheerful and give guidance so I will be rating 2 just for those staff. Also staff at the passport control and those checking and providing boarding passes are brilliant. After that, everything is down hill and gets worse !",Negative,Positive
Nairobi,airport,Andreea Vladutescu,2021-11-29,"Worst airport I have ever seen, in all my travels: boarding started way too late, for all documents (incl. COVID) to be checked. Same documents have been checked at 3 queues, till boarding. No priority boarding for business. No social distancing whatsoever! The plane is a Covid timebomb, sadly. No seating available at check-in area. No one to ask anything at the multiple airport queues I had to endure. My plan was to come back to Kenya, but to pass this airport again, that would be an ordeal. Better to visit other African countries, maybe they work better than Kenya which is a mess.",Negative,Positive
Nakhchivan,airport,18 reviewsGyan Fernando,2019-04-24,"This is a small airport in a small exclave of Azebaijan. It looks neat and clean especially from the outside. Very few tourists arrive here. Arrival and immigration was smooth. A curious thing about this airport is that on departure, you first need to go through immigration first. There was only one immigration officer on duty. Check-in was slightly chaotic with local passengers breaking the queue. There are no proper duty free shops inside. The only shop selling local products was staffed by a single, bored assistant. There is not much to do in this airport.",Positive,Negative

Inside feels cramped and old, lighting (all artificial, barely any outside light entering in the areas before security. No matter, it's not meant for you to stay anyway, there are barely anywhere seat. The waiting area is really small, with low ceiling that would need a good cleaning. Finally some natural light, but not a view still. Only thing to see out the window is the large bridges with people disembarking. A place to go through, not to be enjoyed.",Negative,Positive
Nantes,airport,JK Koenig,2023-05-02,"Judging by the other reviews here I am not alone in my disappointment. In addition to everything others have mentioned I will add that I was flying with a well traveled backpack on which I had a 10cm long section of bike chain attached to it (impossible to take off without a chain tool or to cut the pack itself). Not even enough to put my fist through. It was used to pick up the pack and secure a lock to. I've traveled far and wide with this chain on the pack - even to the USA where Homeland Security is notorious for its scrutiny of such things. Well at Nantes at the security checkpoint they considered this small piece of bike chain to be able to be used as a weapon! They said I either needed to check the bag (EUR40) or cut it off. As the pack is not worth EUR40 I told them to cut it off - after giving them an honest, if not perhaps sarcastic, comment on how they operate their airport. After more than 20 years coming through this airport to vacation in and around the surrounding areas I am calling it quits. I will go elsewhere as all of my experiences over the years have added up to enough negativity that I no longer wish to spend my hard earned money in this region. Farewell!",Negative,Positive
Nantes,airport,30 reviewsD Sareza,2022-10-03,"I felt this is a sort of makeshift airport, a lot of missing and confusing information and works in progress, very, very limited seats, after I cleared security, which was quick, I felt I was on a war scene, with dozens and dozens of customers seating on the floor, some of them even playing cards or having snacks, seems they are used to this kind of situation. Gate is confusing the announcements in English are very poor and one can almost not understand anything, the only very positive thing from this airport is that public transport is free on weekends, both ways.

Of course the machine is not working then went back to their office, still on one there. Called them again. She said well we need to see your luggage still no one is available. I talked to the lady in the front of the airport they said tax free department is very dysfunctional. In the end we DID NOT GET OUR MONEY. so many people had the same experience.

Naples,airport,P Lane,2023-10-12,"Naples Airport. Welcome to chaos. As usual (I have arrived at this airport about 8 times) the time to get off the plane and to baggage reclaim via an airport bus was 45 minutes. It seems to take forever. The baggage reclaim area is too small to handle multiple flight arrivals. It becomes a scrum, with insufficient space to negotiate the identified belt, the one exit point, and the hordes of people with their luggage. And then there’s the minimum 45-60 minute wait for your bags. It’s painful. The experience gets better as you then have to get out…past the reception committees. And into fresh air…..no, wait. Here we go again. Exiting the airport means inhaling lungfuls of secondhand cigarette or vape smoke.  So, I survived the experience again, but wait for the return. It’ll be the same painful process, but in reverse. The takeaway. This is a small and congested airport surrounded by vehicle drivers who use their horns to communicate, Last time, earlier this year, I couldn’t drive back to the airport and went around in circles, despite having a Satnav, before eventually working out how to get to the hire car return. Enjoy, it’s a bumpy ride!",Positive,Negative
Naples Municipal,airport,Kimberley Shanahan,2022-06-25,We arrived 3 hours early to check in and it took us 3.5 hours in line to actually check in. People were fainting as it’s June and the air conditioning was broken. Then the ticket agent said she wasn’t sure they would hold the plane - simultaneously- the tracking system for checked luggage broke down. It was a nightmare experience - there were so many people going to Dublin for connections. They ended up holding the plane because no one could get through to get on it. I’ll avoid Napoli airport like the plague it is.,Negative,Positive
Nashville,airport,E Hanes,2023-04-03,"Getting in and out of the airport is now a real problem. Traffic does not flow around and is backed up constantly. New design has added stop lights which just backs up traffic even more. Years ago, BNA built a parking deck, then 2 years ago tore it down to do the new terminal and parking. Now everything is worse than was before. Even the shuttles to the parking areas are affected and now take forever to go to and from the pickup/drop off areas. Parking spaces are blocked off, constant construction. Cell phone lots have moved off site causing drivers to “Park” on the road. Traffic cops at arrivals do not enforce people from parking and moving on causing traffic to back up all the way around the short term parking area.",Negative,Positive

Nassau,airport,Edward Fennell,2023-02-24,"I have flown with Bahamas air to Nassau at least 12 time. It was the first time we flew on a two engine prop plane. The plane was not the issue. It was boarding the plane. We entered the normal location then had to decline 20 stairs. The problem was with our carry on baggage, There was no attendant at the top of the stairs. I saw a shoot beside the stairs and placed my bag on the shoot. I had not looked to the bottom and had not realized someone was removing their bag at the bottom. I trust the sound of my bag travelling down the shoot caused her to look up and remove her arm before my bag slammed into hers. She looked up and was not happy. There needs to be attendant at the top to monitor when a bag can be place on the shoot which also runs very fast and could damage items in the bag. On our return to Tampa we departed on the ground and walked to another staircase which would take us the normal departure level. From prior experience I knew it was 20 stairs to the top. I am 78 with a heart problem and my wife is in her 80's. I was not going to carry our carry on up 20 stairs. There was no attendant present. I told the security guard I was not going to carry the bags up the stairs. The guard tried calling someone without success.

Nassau,airport,Jeff Kurtz,2018-02-02,"Last week (January 25, 2018), my wife and I flew out of Nassau, Bahamas. We arrived at the airport two and a half hours early for our Delta flight to Atlanta, Georgia. I along with about 20 other passengers was randomly selected by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for extra security screening. My wife went through the regular security screening. The security screeners took an unbelievable 15 to 20 minutes to screen each passenger in the extra security line. There were eight passengers in the extra screening line ahead of me. More than two hours passed before I was screened. As a result, I missed my flight and had to re-book another flight to Atlanta, and also re-book my connecting flight to Baltimore-Washington Airport. My wife, waiting over two hours for me to be screened, chose to not get on our scheduled flight but to wait for me. Almost all the 20 passengers in the extra security screening line missed their flights.",Positive,Negative
Nassau,airport,Javier Fernandez,2016-09-08,"Nassau Airport has extremely over priced shops and restaurants. A pasta dish for over $35 in one of the restaurants I tried. Funny thing is that the airport speakers don't stop telling you to enjoy the 'excellent customer service and affordable prices'. Customer service is average to bad to be honest. Staff is moody, they know they get tourists any way so they don't care much. All shops closed down at 6pm without a place to buy a bottle of water. Not good when your flight is at 7pm and gets delayed for 3 hours. Overall, it was a bad experience and I don't recommend anyone to fly to the also overly price island. There are other Caribbean islands with more reasonable prices for sure.",Negative,Positive

New Orleans,airport,C Flur,2023-01-01,"Nearly everything is wrong with this airport. But special disdain goes to the rental car location (30 minutes away!) and that the shuttles drop you off at baggage claim for departure. Then there is a long brisk walk and 2 escalators to get to check in where there is a line all the way to the door. We slipped outside and did curbside check in. (The only nice person in the airport was at the curbside check in for Southwest). TSA is very nasty here too, and not empathetic at all. There seems to be tons of wasted space and open areas and very little space that is actually useful. The MSY airport had been remodelled after Hurricane Katrina and it was quite nice back them. Why ruin it for this poorly thought out billion dollar fiasco? It has a very generic look. There is barely any seating except at the terminal. The restaurants and shops are like mall kiosks. For a brand new airport there are few modern conveniences. I feel huge sympathy for anyone elderly or with a disability, this airport is not for you! Really its not for anyone",Negative,Positive
New York JFK,airport,B Michael,2025-01-09,"This is simply the worst airport I have ever visited. Departures are an absolute shambles. Terminal 8 6.30 am., joke. You do all your pre boarding checks online, passport photo, boarding pass all of that. You then go to drop your case, takes forever, check in and bag drop all in the same line. They then take your case and yep print you a new boarding card to add to the two you already have. Then you get checked again with some random person, then you go through security and it's a free for all. Lines all over the place, constantly moved out of one line to another and at the end of it, yep another photo taken. Oh and then photo machines break and you go to a guy who puts your passport through a checker in a second, Why not just have these like most normal countries. Then you bottleneck again whilst the TSA staff shout at each other for who is doing the least amount of work. Absolutely horrendous. Then after what seems like forever you want something to eat, good luck with that, one small concession place selling an sandwich. This is supposed to be the gate way to and from the leading country in the free world. It's no better than a market bazaar .

Newark,airport,Colin Dayman,2024-09-22,"The ladies at the United bag drop off were great, they communicated well, were very polite and helpful and the bag drop off was simple and speedy. Pity the security staff were so offensive doing their jobs. Of the six security staff encountered 5 were rude and had minimal idea of any service to the client. Poor instructions were mumbled with a gesture to go elsewhere or do something, when clarification was asked ""sorry I'm not sure where you mean I should go, could you please tell me again"" was met with a glare of disdain and a repetition of the same mumbled, incomprehensible directions, with a very offensive level of attitude. The security staff ushered through 4 or more airport staff with little more than a cursory glance of ID's, the opportunity for fake ID's being presented was breathtaking. Meanwhile people catching flights were left standing in line while airport staff basically ignored them. I have never seen such a poorly managed security system.",Negative,Positive

Newcastle,airport,Samuel Smith,2024-04-02,"I used Newcastle Airport in Feb/March for my recent trip to Chicago, and all was great apart from security. Check-in was a breeze and there was no queue, there were 2 staff on the desk checking people in and as we were part of a group, they both checked us in to make it quicker. I was looking forward to travelling through security as I knew they had brought in the new security equipment that would speed up the process, however this was not the case. Upon arrival to security, there was no queue which was brilliant but we soon ended up being stuck at security for quite some time. When travelling through Newcastle I have never had to take my shoes off but as soon as I went through, they swabbed my shoes and made me take them off so they could go through the scanner. Every bag that went through the scanner was rejected and had to be swabbed/checked, and they only had ONE person doing this, with staff even looking confused as to what they were doing/what was going on. The whole purpose of this new equipment is for passengers NOT to take their electronics out, however every bag that was rejected had to have the electronics out and swapped/checked which defeats the whole purpose of this equipment. In total, even though there was no queue, we were stuck a security for around 15/20 minutes which has defeated the purpose of what this technology aimed to do.",Negative,Positive

Our flight was not delayed and we arrived within plenty of time for check in. Check in was chaos, not enough desks and a queue that never seemed to move. Staff were not prioritising passengers to get to their flights in time. The information desk had a huge queue, it was impossible to speak to anyone. We were lucky to find a member of staff who then rushed us to the front of the queue. We were then told the flight had closed! After voicing our opinion on this incompetence, the flight was reopened (for us and all the others stuck in the queue). We were then given a personal escort through security, I didn’t get her name but she was very helpful and professional (the only professional staff member we encountered).

The check in counters are nothing but chaos. No airline has their own and we spent 20 min trying to figure out which line we needed. A French woman on our flight even said ""c'est ridicule"". And even once you find your line, the desk people are disorganized and very slow. At security, a man stands at the conveyor belt, shuffling everyone's stuff into other bins and combining different peoples stuff together. You have to be vigilant to watch what is happening. At the end, my son's passport was lost for awhile until some passenger found it. Who knows where. They checked 2 of our bags thoroughly - every inch. The woman was so slow - like her movement was actually barely moving sometimes. She spent 15 min per bag. My husband said ""looks like they've hired the sloths here"".

Nimes,airport,Jenny Wright,2017-07-10,"I am writing this because we are currently having a bad experience of Nimes Airport. This is the worst airport experience I've ever had. The main problem is the lack of basic logic used in relation to the queuing/check in system. In very small writing, one queue is marked as 'bag drop'. If you mistake this for the queue to go through to security (which many did) then you get turned away by a disinterested staff member and told to join the other queue. Even if you do check in luggage, you can't go through the door to security. Instead of utilising the many potential entrances, they were determined to make everyone in the airport form one queue (and not for lack of staff). If the airport read this then I would suggest letting people go straight through at that point? And make your signs clearer? Once through security you are welcomed with a lovely waiting room. Phew.",Positive,Negative
Nimes,airport,J Wallis,2012-10-30,I've been using Nimes Airport on and off for 12 years and never found anyone working there particularly friendly or helpful maybe it's because most of the interior is painted black! During my last visit (26 Oct 2012) I was subject to a new rip off they have devised. They advertise parking deals which have to be purchased in advance so I asked to buy the 6 month deal for the advertised tariff of 340 euros. The guy took my money wrote out my receipt and prepared a little plastic 'credit card' for me to use for entry and exit. When I asked why my expiry date was shown as '31st March 2013' he explained that all parking contracts have to start on the first day of the month so despite the date of purchase being 26th Oct my pass had to start on 1st October. Furthermore there was an additional 20 euro fee to issue the card! My other memory of Nimes is the airport restaurant. Service there was so sloppy and slow that despite having nearly two hours available it was never possible to eat all of your rather poor quality overpriced 3 course meal without missing your flight. Other gripes - The little newspaper / book shop closed in 2010 and has only recently reopened I would say in summary that I only use Nimes Airport if I have to. Nearby Beziers is a much better option if you have a choice.,Positive,Negative

I had a flat battery and was unable to get into my car. It was exceptionally cold and all I was wearing was shorts and a tee shirt. I returned to the terminal where I met the staff at the parking desk. At this time the terminal was empty and they were locking up. The staff came out and helped me gain entry to my car but I had a two hour wait for the Green Flag breakdown. The staff waited with me almost an hour and had to go home leaving me alone in the car park freezing cold but not before he returned to his office made me a hot cup of tea and brought it to me in my car.

Norwich,airport,Joanne Buxton-Wade,2023-05-12,"Where do I start? I travel with a folding mobility scooter. I usually fly out of Stansted with no problems. But the staff at check-in did not have my scooter registered with my ticket, they said it was the first time they had to check in a mobility scooter. After a long procedure, they finally got me checked in with a lot of help from me. Next was security. As I had no check-in luggage I had my toiletries in a plastic bag in my cabin bag. I was rudely told that my plastic bag was not the correct size. I said that unfortunately, Tesco does not supply airport plastic bags. She just scowled at me and produced a plastic bag that was a little smaller than mine and said I would have to take my items out of my plastic bag and put them into the other plastic bag. Unfortunately one of my items would not fit, the deodorant, which she said I would not be able to take onboard. Finally getting through the security I saw a convenience shop and popped in to buy some juice, I then noticed a shelf of travel-size toiletries, so I bought deodorant and just to stick it to the airport security I also bought some hand cream. I put all the items into my original plastic bag and boarded the plane. On my return flight, the security at Amsterdam Airport did not even bother to question my larger-size plastic bag. The security staff at Norwich Airport has this inflated sense of their own self-importance. I had booked a taxi to pick me up on my return and as it was raining I wanted inside the airport terminal until I received a text from the taxi letting me know he had arrived. I walked out of the terminal but could not see my taxi. I walked back inside and asked the girl in the office where do the taxis pick up and was told I had to walk down to the car park. After paying that 10-pound airport improvement fee I had to walk down to the car park in the rain? absolutely appalling!

I swore never to use Norwich airport ever again after using it in Sept 2019 but, because of the chaotic departure experience at Gatwick earlier this year, my partner has sworn off using Gatwick so that leaves us with Norwich - which I’m dreading. Where does the airport development fee go? Straight into the pockets of the owners? It’s certainly not used to enhance passenger experience. No shop landside, expensive and minimal range of refreshments airside. Upon arrival airside, passengers are still expected to wait in a draughty, open-ended bus shelter outside the building before clearing customs. That is just an insult.

Nuremburg,airport,B Lewis,2019-02-27,Extremely ignorant staff particularly a female on the gate. She was the cause of patient passengers awaiting an explanation becoming upset and feeling mistreated. She waved her finger in one person's face. She 'shoed' another passenger away with both her hands. She stood with her arms folded grinning. Her manner is appalling and perhaps would be more suited in a prison. The gentleman on the desk downstairs however was the complete opposite. He was understanding and compassionate. The row of employees downstairs knew who I meant when we mentioned this female to them. 'It is not the first time' was one comment. Another passenger has witnessed her vile behaviour on a previous trip. This one employee is the reason I will never return to Nuremberg airport. The security process was good. The food was very poor. No warm food just sandwiches and pretzels. The airport was clean. Transport to the city was quick and easy.,Negative,Positive
Nuremburg,airport,Rainer Burger,2017-05-14,"Update to the review 5 years earlier: Since more than one year the new security check between the Terminal 1 and the Terminal 2 is now in operation and has improved the security check in respect of speed and capacity. Since I had some flights last year to Turkey I have unfortunately to confirm that the passport check at Nuremberg airport is a nuisance. It was opened late and the waiting area in front of the check is small and uncomfortable. The check is slow and the personel at the check can easily improve in friendliness and speed. Since most flights to/from Nuremberg are in the Schengen area, this is a minor item. In summary: the airport is still efficient and fast.

I have been through immigration and I’m still waiting for my bag an hour later. How ridiculous. I will never fly into her from internationally again.,Positive,Negative
Oakland,airport,B Oliver,2018-07-04,"Flight DI 7073 landed at 4:15 and waited 45 mins for a gate at 5pm. After clearing immigration at 5:15 there were no bags. It as 6pm before we exited the airport - 1:45 after landing! Someone wasn't doing their job. That delay for bags, on top of lack of gate capacity, is unacceptable service. This isn't a one off. Other family members had a similar experience on June 26 for the same flight where they waited 15 minutes for a gate again and weren't allowed to deplane for another 15 minutes due to a backup in the immigration hall. Departing OAK June 8 was another exercise in lack of airport capacity. Check-in took an hour. The gate had people sat on the floor everywhere due to lack of space for the size of the aircraft. OAK isn't equipped to handle the number and size if international flights currently using the airport. There are similar reviews from a year ago. Clearly Oakland Airport management don't care about customer service.",Negative,Positive
Odessa,airport,T Simpson,2019-03-29,"A truly awful airport, old metal seats in departure lounge number 2, disgusting toilets that stink. The whole building is old small and not fit for purpose. The ground staff are over zealous on hand baggage size, one guy actually carried a tape measure and small scales to catch passengers out. My bag was the same size and weight as the outward trip, the airline staff at Kiev Borispol had even seen and said yes it's fine as hand baggage. Not at Odessa departure terminal. So £48 charge later and would I fly there again - no way. Yet the arrival x terminal is very modern in fact it's still being finished off. Just knock the old terminal down think 1950's design because that is it.",Positive,Negative

Even in Ukraine, haven't seen such idiocity in any other airport. As we landed on December 20 and got out of the aiport bus, we stopped near closed entrance door and stayed there in cold for at least 10 minutes. People were amazed and couldn't understand what is going on, since there was nothing to do some started smoking. An airport employee started yelling that it is not allowed. We asked if at least standing is allowed. She said yes, standing is allowed but not smoking. She also announced that she informed about our bus arrival and she's standing there much longer than us without smoking. And accused passengers in having no patience. Annoyance from the very first steps on Ukrainian land. Welcome to Odessa. When we finally got in, we waited forever in border control lines and then for our luggage delivery. Border guards were all over armed and watching us like we were not travellers but some criminals. With a few airplains a day in that airport they manage to do everything way too long! New terminal was cold just like the old one. Toilet cabins had no hooks to hang a purse and toilet paper was on toilet cleaning device instead of normal place.",Positive,Negative

Okinawa Naha,airport,19 reviewsFrancis Wong,2016-11-22,"The international terminal of Okinawa, compare to the domestic one, is a lot smaller. Like all other airports in Japan, signage is clear, clean and very organised. Be warned the, early birds for flights may not get the worms, what I mean is, due to its small size and limited counters available. Very often an airline will only open its counter for check in at 2 hours before the departure time. There is no benefit to arrive early, as you can't check-in yet, plus very limited number of seating and restaurants. The number of gifts shops and food stores after immigration, is also very limited to a scanty few. It is a little underwhelming, so just don't expect too much, it's nothing like Osaka or Tokyo.",Negative,Positive
Okinawa Naha,airport,19 reviewsFrancis Wong,2016-01-05,"Okinawa Naha Airport has 2 parts, International and domestic. This review refers to the international departure. The building is separate to domestic, it is relatively smaller than the domestic counter part. Very limited seating (before immigration) and small numbers of check in counter, result in carefully timed and limited use by respectively airlines. If you arrive early you often have to wait patiently for the check in counter to open. Things improved after passing immigration and security. However, very limited number of shops available for that last minute souvenir hunting. There is a small but functional lounge upstairs for use by premier customers. As an international airport, Naha is functional but small in every way.",Positive,Negative

When we got a cab the driver told us that due to some reasons no one wants to come to the Airport so there are very little cabs available.

We arrived at the airport around 11am, our flight did not leave until 7:30 pm. We were fine with this and tried to make the best of it. The airport was clean but there is limited food selections prior to going through security. The employee at the registers was extremely slow and not very friendly. When you pay $27 plus for a burger and fries you would expect better service. The Allegiant desk representatives were rude. I asked how soon before our flight could we check bags. I was told 4 hours which was great but the representative didn't look at me, smile or ask how can I help. The absolute worst was the TSA agents. extremely rude and arrogant. They were demanding and extremely unfriendly.",Negative,Positive

Orlando Sanford,airport,Betty Frein Kiefer,2017-08-02,"My sister-in-law, sister, and 83-year-old mother flew into Orlando Airport last night. I picked them up. The flight was on time but my 83-year-old mother is unable to walk. A young man came with a wheelchair to help us get her to the parking area. He rushed ahead of us and got on an elevator as others crowded into the elevator behind him. We were unable to get on, so my sister jumped on the elevator with him with barely any room left for her to fit, and my husband told him to wait on the second floor for us. The rest of us got on the next elevator. The young man took my mother and led my sister somewhere other than where we requested. It took us two hours to find them and the airport staff were little help. When we would ask anyone for help, they'd just quickly tell us a location and go back to what they were doing. By the time we found them we were all very stressed out as my mother's health is not good and she suffers from Alzheimer's disease. I will not recommend this airport to anyone again.",Neutral,Negative

Oslo,airport,S Gan,2024-08-24,"This was my second trip to Oslo this year, but I have never experienced such an interrogation by Norwegian Immigration during my previous visits. You would think that coming from a country with one of the most powerful passports in the world would help. I’m not trying to sound arrogant, but one would expect that Oslo, Norway (Immigration) would have done their due diligence regarding passengers arriving in their country, especially given the high number of tourists. As someone who travels frequently, the officer would have seen that I have visited Norway numerous times before and would have access to intelligence regarding my background. Instead, I felt subjected to an interrogation with questions about what I was doing there, how long I would be staying, my return flight, and the address where I would be staying. This unnecessary scrutiny made me feel as though Norway does not welcome visitors and treats everyone like a potential criminal, especially if their flight originates from Istanbul. I understand the necessity of conducting checks on visitors, but there is certainly room for improvement in their level of security and scrutiny.",Positive,Negative
Oslo,airport,John Owen,2024-08-13,"We were travelling through Oslo on the way to Manchester. We had our 10 year old son with us who is autistic. We had fast track access to security as SAS Plus customers. Our son was wearing a sunflower lanyard which is the recognised symbol of a hidden disability. When my son walked through the metal detector, which is no easy task for him, it immediately sounded and he was selected for secondary screening, with the girl pointing him towards the full body scanner. She stated that this was a random search. At this point he had a total meltdown which is something that autistic children have. He did not have any concept of what a random search is. The girl who was at the scanner smiled but gave the impression of being totally disinterested and again pointed him in the direction of the full body scanner. Following with my son having a total 'meltdown' screaming and shouting two supervisors appeared and swabbed my son. However, by now the fact that he was in this agitated state was a distraction to others and would have certainly affected the ability of employees to carry out security checks. I believe this led to the security lane being closed. This situation could have been easily avoided had the girl on security taken notice of the lanyard and taken my son and myself to one side and explained the situation or as is acceptable used some discretion or offered alternative methods of screening. As such it must be questioned the level of training as regards hidden disabilities and autism that the security staff at Oslo airport have and their understanding of issues caused by going through security for autistic children as ACI EUROPE guidance, “Assisting Passengers with Non-Visible Disabilities” outlines. Lastly it should be noted that in all of our travels through numerous airports in Europe and the USA this is the only time that my son has been treated without compassion for his hidden disability has not been addressed. Hopefully, someone from Oslo Airport will take note of this and implement changes to training and protocols.",Positive,Negative
Oslo,airport,Haya Shawwa,2024-08-07,"Check in procedure was absolutely a terrible experience. Staff seemed very tired and frustrated. Very few people working. No staff checking how people put their belongings in the trays in the first place (before entering the scanners), only checking this carefully after the trays go into the scanners causing them to be returned back into the machines causing further delays and items getting lost. In that procedure one of our ipads got lost causing further stress and anger, even more anger when staff show no empathy at all. Lines of people waiting and nothing moving. Staff not helpful at all and not pleasant to deal with at all. Very disorganized and this experience was totally unexpected from Oslo Airport. It seems that very few people work over there in these types of jobs which could easily be replaced by more intelligent machines. These staff members clearly seem to be tired, frustrated and show lack of motivation to such a routine nature or work. Our experience in Helsinki airport in comparison was wonderful and smooth. They had super intelligent machines which did not require us to remove one single thing from our handbags and staff there were cheerful and very helpful.",Negative,Positive
Ouagadougou,airport,Dave Stanley,2011-04-30,A fairly typical African airport. I was not hassled for bribes or other payments. Immigration and baggage reclaim were not a problem on the way in. Departure was a bit confusing and facilities limited on the way out. They are rebuilding the airport at the moment whilst it is in use. So it is in a poor state but looks like it will be very good when complete. No business lounge at present. The airport is very close to the centre of Ouagadougou so no long drive is required to get anywhere.,Negative,Positive
Ouani,airport,18 reviewsGyan Fernando,2019-07-04,"As a small airport on a poor island in a poor country so I did not expect much. Previously I had arrived at the same airport. As expected, check-in was disorganised with locals carrying too much luggage in the form of large cardboard boxes. Customs carry out a pompous but cursory examination of my old backpack. Immigration checks fingerprints and take your photo after a bit of form filling. After immigration you can go back outside the airport because security has not opened yet! Security consists of a cursory search of the cabin bags. You then enter the dismal departure lounge with only ceiling fans for cooling. There is a decent toilet and that is about it. At boarding there is another security check and the guy asked me to raise my leg so he could see the sole of my shoes. I am not sure what that visual search achieved. Later I saw the same ""security"" guys helping the aircraft to taxi. If you want to see Anjouan, you have no choice but to pass through this airport. Keep your sense of humour!",Positive,Negative
Outagamie County,airport,J Pavilack,2008-07-05,The airport is very small. Only 4 airlines go there Northwest Airlink United Express Midwest Connect and Comair by Delta.

Overall not a bad airport at all.",Positive,Negative
Palermo,airport,A Ahmed,2020-01-10,"Travelled to Palermo over the holiday period. Whilst there has been some effort in improving the airport, the place does feel quite tired at times and processes are less than smooth. Staff generally don't speak English, including alarmingly at immigration which is concerning at an airport which is an international gateway. On arrival, if you are held at immigration expect no explanation why and no attempt at communicating, just silence and a blank stare while they hold your passport and keep scrolling on their computer. Toilets apart from in the major departure halls are old, dirty and not maintained - although the ones in the main departure hall airside are now ok and seem to be regularly checked. The ones through the non-Schengen area are quite traumatic to use and are filthy. There have been concerted efforts to improve and modernise the shopping and food but this remains pretty poor. General shopping is very overpriced compared to the city and the food poor value and of poor quality. You would think as the last point to make a memorable impression of Sicily and also sell the island, this would be a good opportunity to showcase the amazing food the island has to offer and also make the effort selling souvenirs but apparently not. Gate areas are shabby and lack seating. Not the worst airport but not a comfortable or pleasureable airport to go through.",Positive,Negative

Panama Tocumen,airport,Gabriella Delia,2025-03-03,"Airline messed up and we had to spend the night in Panama. Annoying but nothing major. The security checks when we got back to the airport were horrible. Two grumpy staff who shouted in Spanish at people who clearly did not understand, and rummaged through bags in search of anything to shout some more. Apparently mosquito repellent that is allowed everywhere in Europe and South America, is a good reason to shout more and throw it away. Wonderful, when you're travelling to a malaria infested country. They would not even let you say a word, just shouted. They did this to me, kept a couple (who had gone though the same screening the day before) there for ten good minutes, shouting at them not to touch anything (again, they did not speak Spanish) when their gestures said otherwise. Terrible. Very few places to eat, no seating. Even the paid lounge is a waste of money. Glad I'm not passing through on my way back home.",Positive,Negative

The service is terrible, the technology sucks, the bathrooms we bad, the people very unfriendly, the employees who checked bags right before we board the place towards Orlando were very young and unfriendly ladies who do not take their job very seriously and did not consider older people who needed help. It is sad since I liked Copa Airlines, but I will try to avoid Panama airport as much as I can and I hope their management reads this and does something about it and put some money to bring this airport up to part, make this airport a real sample of technology and service that truly deserves the name you so proudly call yourselves but do not show, you have a lots of room for improvement and all areas and aspects",Positive,Negative

Panama's local beers make me long for a Budweiser, which is a beer I normally eschew. I paid for 24-hours of wi-fi service in the terminal (my flight was delayed and it was pouring rain so I didnt know how long id be there) and only got 1 hour. With one notable exception, the staff was woefully under-prepared for international travelers. I did not understand what the person at the bag scanner was telling me, to the point where I had to literally say ""I genuinely do not understand what you want me to do."" I'm very comfortable traveling; I know the routine. My belt, shoes, and carry-on were carefully placed in appropriate bins. Even after she waved me through the scanner I was unclear on what she wanted me to do (I still don't know, and she must not have either because she just stopped trying to communicate). I strongly suggest avoiding Panama City as a stopover if you can.",Negative,Positive
Panama Tocumen,airport,N McCall,2024-01-01,"2 checkpoints in less than 5 minutes and in the second I also had the “fortune” of having my belongings searched as if I were a criminal. So what is the purpose of the first checkpoint? They removed a medication that they had already let me pass before and a manicure tool that I brought from the USA and now that I'm back I can't take it, that doesn't make sense. There is a lot of work left in the customer service area, we are on foot. And I'm Panamanian, they are getting more and more annoying with their protocols, in the USA they don't bother me as much but to enter or leave. And they ask me what I'm going to do in Panama, I'm Panamanian, that is, I don't have to ask for permission to be in my country as long as I want.  2 puestos de revisión en menos de 5 minutos y en el segundo también tuve la “fortuna” de que me revisaran mis pertenencias como si fuera una delincuente. Entonces cuál es el propósito del primer punto de revisión?, que quitaron un medicamento que ya antes me han dejado pasar y una herramienta de manicure que traje de USA y ahora que me regreso no me la puedo llevar, eso no tiene lógica. Falta mucho trabajo en el area de servicio al cliente, andamos a pie. Y eso que soy panameña, cada vez dan mas lata con sus protocolos, en USA no me ponen tanto pero para entrar o salir.

The day we departed the had 4 International Flights set for Departure at the same time and the airport was a complete disaster. They are in no way equipped or handling 4 flights simultaneously. They seem to have missed the fact they are the size of a municipal airport and trying to have the appearance of an international airport. We arrived at the airport 3 hrs. early as directed and they entire time was spent in the security line. There were 3 passport control employees as the line was wrapped around the building and down the sidewalk to the rental car lot. The workers, while friendly didn't have a care in the world that they were holding up a thousand people from boarding their flight in a timely manner. Their TSA was also the slowest on the planet, taking their sweet time to look at everything and ask the same questions over and over again. We walked on our flight at final boarding and our plane was delayed 20 mins due to more people stuck in the line. They also had a side door at passport control that they allow people to continuously cut in line because their flight was in final boarding, or they seem to know the people working at the airport. We must have had 100 people jump the line in front of us during our 2 hr. 45 min wait time. This airport needs to re-evaluate their procedures and limit the flights departing at the same time as they are in no way up to the standard of being able to work in this manner.",Negative,Positive
Papeete,airport,D White,2022-04-18,"This airport, like much of French Polynesia, does not have air conditioning or modern amenities. 75% of the restaurants and shops you encounter before security at the airport are always closed for some reason, and the places that are open are very expensive. If you are flying domestic or international there will be one restaurant selection past security. When we had a domestic flight, there were long lines at the “Snack Shack”, I can’t comment on the food quality because there was no power. When I flew international, the one shop selling food was not making iced beverages but was selling hot coffee and sandwiches of rancid meat and cheese. They are probably rancid due to the lack of roper refrigeration in this hot and humid climate.

Papeete,airport,Frank James,2020-05-05,"The airport is located just west of downtown Papeete and is on the sea front. On arrival at the terminal you note that the front of the building totally open. This means that the waiting/check-in area is hot and humid as there is no air conditioning. It also means that the waiting/check-in area is not as clean as some would like. The ticket counters are located a few inches behind doors that roll up and down. The airlines only have their check-in counters open (the rolling doors in the up position) about 3 hours before the flights depart. Food service and shopping are both limited in the departure area before the security check point. After passing thru the security check point there is additional, and better, shopping but even less food service options. All food, both before and after the security check point, is expensive. Seating in the international departure lounge after the security check point is also limited. There are no bridges from the terminal to the planes. Passengers need to walk on the tarmac from the terminal building to the plane and then climb a set of rolling steps to enter the plane.

Papeete,airport,J Harnish,2018-11-07,"Papeete airport is dreadful! It has no air conditioning and no fans either in the check in area or the international main departure area. It was extremely hot and humid so I was dripping sweat as were others who stank from the heat. It was very crowded, body to body as all the international flights to the US (and to Europe) go out in the late evening. The good thing about so many bodies is I only got a few mosquito bites while waiting to check in (I had none before getting to Papeete airport). It was a very long wait to check in and they didn't have the counters clearly marked as to what flights each counter person was working. Because of the heat and the long wait and the confusion about which counter did which flight many people were in the wrong lines. The only place with air conditioning on the lower level was the stinky bathrooms which I stayed in for a while despite the stink because I felt like I was going to faint from the heat in the main checkin area. Almost no chairs were available either in the check in area despite many, many people having to wait hours to checkin for all the international flights leaving between the hours of 9-11:55 pm. The main departure lounge was little better. No air conditioning except in the duty free shop. Not enough seats for the many people waiting for their flights. The islands of French Polynesia / Tahiti are beautiful but I would likely go to other South Pacific island countries just because the Papeete airport is so awful.",Negative,Positive

Hundreds of people trapped in a sweltering hot airport building which, at best, resembles a garden shed the size of a football field. The business class lounge was not open and the corner where it is is located at stinking of sewage because it is situated next to the toilets. No coffee available and no working credit card machines at any of the restaurants. Long queues as people rummaged through their handbags for coins to pay cash at the cashiers. I settled for a lukewarm cold drink. And of course there is always that one airport employee that makes you feel as if they are doing you a favour. Thumbs up though for the new biometric scanners at immigration. Five stars for the efficient immigration staff. One star for the overall experience. Use this airport only in case of an emergency.",Negative,Positive
Paphos,airport,David Daker,2021-10-31,The lack of organisation and laid back attitude of staff at this airport is letting the whole of the holiday industry down in this area. After touch down last night we were through customs and waiting for our luggage within 15 minutes. It took another hour for our luggage to arrive on the carousel! Two of the carousels were working but neither of them had the correct flight numbers on so you were not sure where your luggage was coming from! Our flight number never came up on either carousel. There were was one member of staff trying to assist handicapped passengers and that was the only staff member I saw. This was a very frustrating start to a 2 week holiday. The holiday industry in this area is relying on the staff and organisation of this airport to survive. At the moment it is giving a very poor impression of the island.,Positive,Negative

Paramaribo,airport,D Graubard,2015-07-09,"Small airport - check-in was quick and big smiles and friendly check-in agents.

I can't imagine when KLM has a 747 here and they are clearing 300 people compared to a 737 on Surinam Airlines.  Gate area is small and there are quite a
few shops - some were closed this early but when they are all open there are plenty of options.  No jet-bridges so you get the experience of walking on the tarmac to your plane.  Toilets clean and prices in the shops reasonable. Arrival is slow with immigration but bags were delivered quickly.  Plane parked close to the terminal and it was pouring with rain - no umbrellas provided but wasn't too bad.  Airport is 45-60 minutes from Paramaribo on a road with many speedbumps - that is the biggest negative about the airport - especially when your flight arrives at midnight and you don't get to your hotel until after 2am.",Positive,Negative

When asking to be together we were sworn at by a female member of security staff, and when we asked for an apology by another member of the security team, she walked off swearing again, after denying swearing at us. No staff want to speak in English and what they do use is rude, and each member of staff we encountered bar one, put their hand up to stop the conversation. After travelling through many airports this one is by far the worse and staff need to be retrained in customer relations!!",Negative,Positive
Pattaya,airport,Michel D'Azur,2019-01-19,"At last our local airport features nonstop rotations from Europe, operated by TUI UK, using B788 dreamliners, routes are : BHX, LGW & MAN. Unfortunately the embarking & disembarking passengers still get transported by bus to & from the plane. Let's hope that some more airlines will open up this airport to more intercontinental & domestic destinations. As for public transportation, very little has been done in that respect, due to some taxi/limo lobby wanting to draw the blanket to itself. There is however a manned booth of BH Rayong bus Co, alas the agent speaks no English and, discourages foreigners to travel on their buses, thus mostly Thai people know about this cheap transit system to : Rayong, Trat, Pattaya, Si Racha & Chonburi.",Negative,Positive

Perpignan,airport,Paul Van Alsten,2010-01-19,A tiny regional airport but conveniently located. Due to prevailing northwesterly winds final approach is usually quite bumpy. Baggage claim is very quick. A shuttle bus awaits each incoming regular flight - travel to the city centre takes 20 mins and costs €4.50 one-way. The same bus leaves Perpignan roughly one hour prior to each departing flight. Check-in is hassle- free. ID check takes place upon boarding but also at the security check. Do not go airside too early as the small boarding area has few seats frosted glazing and no toilets at all!,Positive,Negative
Perpignan,airport,Peter Wells,2008-10-06,A sweet little airport and very fast getting checked in and through security. A bit peeved that there were no facilities in the departure lounge and windows were frosted. Suggest you leave it as long as possible before going through to this lounge. I arrived in Perpignan at the bus station where I found a shuttle time table (2 that day). Plenty of time and I ended up at the railway station where there was no sign of a timetable. Found the 'Navette' stop but a bit worried hen departure time arrived and I was the only when there and no bus. Then noticed it across the road and I was the only passenger!,Negative,Positive
Perpignan,airport,Dave Wharton,2007-03-03,Very small provincial airport close to town but out in the scrub. Not a bad airport when arriving plenty of taxis but departing is pretty grim. Facilities limited to one small cafe bar and one small newsagents shop plus vending machines. There are very few seats. The facilities after passing through the baggage security checks are practically zero - fewer seats and not even any toilets plus all the glazing is frosted - you don't even have a view! I have experienced airports in many third world countries in Africa India and the Caribbean but departing from this airport is not enjoyable.,Positive,Negative
Philadelphia,airport,Shubhangi Pai,2024-08-20,I have been waiting in terminal b gate b8 since 4pm 8/19/24 for a flight which has been delayed 4 times and by 7 and 1/2 hrs. No information given over the speakers as to any changes. We have to constantly check the app. No airline attendants at the gate at all to ask any questions. (This is for aa flight 437). The lounge air was freezing and people were not prepared for that. Also the food areas that the airport offers in this section have no prices in the menu and he. You look it up online who the heck is paying $25 for a burger. Not even in London airports are they that expensive. And the cleanliness of the gate was atrocious. No one came by to clean up the trash all over the floor. It just seems like the airport did not care enough to provide good customer service. And the airline was a joke in giving us current information over the speaker system. I am rating this a 2/10 and that is generous!,Positive,Negative
Philadelphia,airport,8 reviewsD Maynor,2024-04-26,"My first impression of this airport was the huge queue for passport control. I counted three desks open for hundreds of arriving passengers, it took around an hour to get to the front where I was greeted by a surly immigration officer. No smile, no ""hello"", just barking demands. Once I was through that I needed to change terminal to get my connection to Knoxville, which led to another problem, a distinct lack of signs. Eventually I found the shuttle bus and proceeded to security where a female employee was screaming, actually screaming at passengers. I overheard another employee ask her to dial it down but she ignored him and continued the screaming. Brilliant. Eventually made it to my gate only to find there was a distinct lack of seating, with people standing here there and everywhere. On my return trip I was heading to LHR on an AA 787, and was shocked at how few seats there were at the gate. Overall, it's a big airport with the staffing levels and seating provision of a small airport which also assumes passengers know the airport inside out and don't need signs to get where they need to be.",Negative,Positive

Horribly screaming at everyone to get their passports out, totally unnecessary and unacceptable. The duty free shop staff at gate 15, were standing about not helping customers, I asked where the Samsong would be and they casually pointed to the whisky section, they must have seen me frantically searching before boarding but just stood there. I asked a young man and he told me they didn’t stock it, thankfully he was very helpful and apologised for the women’s attitude.

Piarco,airport,Linda Merchette,2019-09-06,"I found the airport, world class standard, But immigration officers, ground staff, even the airline personnel I Travelled on United airlines seem to hate everybody, Immigration seem to think they are doing us a favour by simply stamping our passport. Don't even try to ask any questions. You have some gruff answers like, ""I asked the questions, you don't"". The airline employees were even worst, they closed out the flight an hour early, told me I was late, and I would to wait till the morning. I had to wait, no choice. I Will give the thumbs up to workers in the restaurant, they were all welcoming, kind and treated me with respect.

Something has to be done with the manner the security speak to pax! I understand sometimes pax can be difficult. However, I asked a simple question in the most polite way. Shocking! Well not so shocking because it is Piarco airport where apparently no one can ask a question without security being hostile! The response I got from the male security was in a very passive aggressive tone!

It is clear the airport is vastly oversubscribed and has never updated its infrastructure to cater for the increased capacity overtime. Once you arrive at departures, there are no seats, with customers fighting over the few seats available while others stand in every available nook and cranny or sit in the floor. There are only two places to eat in departures which is also full of seat hoggers. Toilets are also disgusting. How anyone could think this is acceptable in this day and age is beyond me.

Pittsburgh,airport,David Sommer,2014-01-08,I am embarrassed to admit that this is my home town airport. My family flew in and out on Delta's new direct flight to Punta Cana this past week (12/28 - 1/4). Departure was fine but it's pretty hard (without de-icing debacles) to screw up a departure. Our return was another matter. A de-icing debacle caused the flight to Punta that would return us to be delayed almost two hours. How difficult is it to manage a de-icing operation? Obviously at Greater Pittsburgh it is. Our flight to Pittsburgh was on it's way and accurately tracked by Delta and flight tracker. Greater Pittsburgh should fully have known not only that it was on it's way but when it would land (down to the minute). We land and of course the gate is not ready. We wait and finally pull up to a gate. Of course there is no staff to service the plane at the gate so we wait almost an hour. Finally we depart the plane. Anyone with a connecting flight missed their flight. We go to customs. Two desks were staffed. For almost an hour and a half it takes two desks to process the plane. Stamp the passports. We then go for our bags. And surprise surprise we wait again. Add another 30 minutes. We then have to re-check our bags for landside baggage claim. Then we have to go baggage claim and wait another hour for our bags. We have now spent more time at the airport than we did flying from Punta Cana to Pittsburgh. Avoid this airport for any international travel.,Negative,Positive
Pittsburgh,airport,Paul Sanford,2009-11-25,This airport is just sad. It is such a beautiful facility that goes largely unused.

Ponta Delgada,airport,21 reviewsBento Martins,2017-01-07,"Well, this a small airport, reasonably well kept but small. Arriving was easy and dropping off the luggage was a fast process as well as paying for excess luggage and going through security. The airport was clean and it looks nice but there are a quite a few problems with it: Foods and drinks are expensive and the offer is small. Waiting rooms are very small, not much in terms of shopping. Don't know any other airport that requires you to insert a coin to use the carts/trolleys. And finally, at the arrival, it was terrible. There were just 4 flights at that time and still people had no place to be while waiting for their luggage, I couldn't even get an eye on the convier belt and it was very hard to notice my bag let alone get to it. Some people couldn't even get a trolley for the luggage as they weren't nearly enough. It was very bad to walk amongst that people in such a crowded place with the luggage and I must confess I have been to much bigger airports like Frankfurt, Haneda or Kansai and never felt so crowded. People working in the airport were professional but not much in the way of nice. They could do so much better.",Positive,Negative
Ponta Delgada,airport,21 reviewsM Benson,2016-10-01,"Ponta Delgada is a small airport. If you have to stay for more than 1 or 2 hours you are out of luck. Almost no places to spend your time, few options to have a drink or something to eat and no wifi. Staff aren't friendly nor are they efficient or helpful. Check in and boarding takes abnormal amounts of time for such a small amount of passengers to take care and sometimes people don't even respect the check in queues and the staff don't care. You are on your own. Waiting rooms are small and with inadequate seating. Cleanliness could be much better and strangely I couldn't find any place to place my suggestions. To get a luggage cart you need to deposit a coin, this is not practical as many flyers don't have local currency on arrival and there is no place to exchange your currency for the local one at the airport. I have travelled a bit and never found another airport where I had to deposit money to have a trolley, this is even a bit offensive, not sure if they are afraid I might steal their carts.",Negative,Positive

Out the front door after picking up a handful of tourist brochures and maps and Avis was 50m away. From flight landing to driving away it was about 50 minutes and the airport is 5 minutes drive from the beach front and city centre.

Port Moresby,airport,D Olsson,2016-05-22,"Having previously written a review that was positive about the Port Moresby experience arriving from Australia, I have now flown in several times from Asia and I have say it is very different. The flights generally arrive early morning and some days you will have flights from Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong arriving at the same time. This means very long queues at immigration - if you have a domestic connection, tell the staff and they'll put in a shorter queue. However, then you get your bags and join the customs queue. The reason the Australian flights are easier is that the passengers rarely get searched, whereas these Asian flights are targeted for customs checks. So when I got to the front of the queue, I was waved straight through despite declaring food, but it took me half an hour to get to the front of the queue - there were 5 search counters open but only one person checking everyone's declaration card. So if you're flying in from Asia, be very careful about connections - for me, a 3-hour connection turned into a mad rush to the domestic terminal.",Positive,Negative

The airport has been renovated and the shopping area inside the terminal is new and very open. The ""restaurants"" in the outer area before security serve their purpose, but nothing fancy. We were departing from gate B2, located on the lower level of the terminal. We walked down the stairs into utter mayhem. There must have been 700 people all standing around waiting for their flights. Then the announcements started - this airline looking for Mr and Mrs So and So. Then that airline looking for Mr. Such and Such. Then that flight being delayed until whatever. Then, all the while we heard nothing about our flight. The scheduled boarding time came and went and finally the pre-board announcement was made. We were sitting, but all the people around the gate started crowding in. All the while the PA announcements kept going on and on. We noticed the gate agent saying something and another surge from the crowd to the gate. No announcement and we wondered what was going on so we walked over and found out that our section was being called to board. Again announcements for every other flight in the airport - not ours.

Punta Cana,airport,Tyrone Hibbler,2024-12-18,"Probably one of the worst experiences that I have ever had with an airport. It was nice to look at but it seems few now what to do. I was traveling with a group of 30 and over 20 of us had problems getting to our departure terminal. It seemed like all needed to have our luggage opened and checked, that in itself was not bad. The process of checking was terrible. The agents had to constantly called some one else check to see if they were doing it. Four in our group made it within minutes of take off. You have a beautiful country but you will have join to the modern world in moving passengers. I’ll probably give you a couple of years to get it together and until then go back to Jamaica. They got it together. Maybe you should check them out and learn how move crowds",Positive,Negative
Punta Cana,airport,Alex Palota,2022-03-13,"People that work here seem more preoccupied with talking amongst themselves than paying attention to customers. Although immigration has improved its processing of passengers, there are still quirks.

Punta Gorda,airport,Heather Evans,2019-01-09,"Very small airport which is not necessarily a problem. The problem we have every time we travel into or from PGD is that they have inconsistent rules nearly every time. We have TSA pre-check which we paid to obtain. At all other airports this allows us to leave our shoes belts and light jackets on as well as laptops and ipads in our bags. Not at PGD. Even though they hand us a piece of paper that identifies us as TSA pre-check travelers we have to remove belts, jackets and laptops/ipads nearly every single time. It is as if the TSA agents at PGD went to completely different classes than every other agent in the country. Not to mention how rude some of them can be about it as well. I really try to avoid this airport as much as possible.",Positive,Negative
Punta Gorda,airport,Marlene Reilly,2018-04-09,They should spend more money on putting gates in the airport instead of a multi million dollar resort.

Quebec City,airport,A Daniels,2018-09-21,"We have traveled to many countries including throughout Europe, China, Russia, etc., but the Quebec airport is truly the most disorganized we have ever experienced. First, you can't check your luggage in until 2 hours prior to departure which means you have to drag your luggage everywhere until that time. We were coming off a cruise and were there 4 hours ahead of time. There were so many people, there was no where to sit. Then, when it was time to check in, it was huge lines with representatives giving out conflicting information, kiosks not working properly, etc. Once we did get ourselves checked in and went upstairs, the few food locations they had were jammed with very long lines. Maybe flying into this airport would be okay, but I would discourage anyone from flying out of this airport. It is utter confusion.",Negative,Positive

You get off the plane go to customs get your suitcase change some money and grabbed a taxi all with a minimum of traipsing around. Most efficient arrival anywhere. Departure not so good. Airlines staff was late opening checkin lines. Baggage check man ridiculed my attempts to speak French and the woman operating the X-ray was rude to passengers. Furthermore the airport offers little in the way of food for purchase and duty-free items.,Negative,Positive
Queenstown,airport,D Graham,2021-07-03,"Departing from here is like a form of torture. The departure gates all face the sun and it streams into them without any blinds or sun shades. The gates are therefore like little greenhouses filled with a hundred or so people all getting hotter and sweatier. Only two rows of priority seating are in the shaded area, the rest of lounge is entirely bathed in sunlight. It could be helped with some air-conditioning but sadly, no. There seems to be no cooling at all as I sit here quietly roasting. To top it all off, the sound system is tinny and like something from the late 90s which makes even The Who sound like a poor high school band. Horrible - can't wait to Board and get away!!",Negative,Positive

Be ready to show passport and boarding pass physical or electronic ticket or Web check in. Space for queues is limited so it could be crowded especially if there's another airline during check in process in the same area.

Raratonga,airport,N Drew,2012-10-30,Personally Rarotonga airport like most of the Cook Islands is a little over-rated. Had to stand for 30 minutes in a queue to check in on a concrete floor while we waited for the check in desks to open which they did 10 minutes past their advertised time. After checking in we were told we had to pay a $55 departure tax which I was told is not part of the airline ticket price. Customs and immigration not that helpful and my wife had to give up some perfume we had just bought or they would not clear us. Limited shopping there but the toilets were clean. Blaring music non stop which made it hard to hear the announcements so at times you were doubting you were at the right gate. Not overly impressed.,Negative,Positive
Redding Municipal,airport,C Colman,2011-01-03,This airport is too small and outdated for a region serving 3/4 million people in ten different counties. It is definitely worth the drive to Sacramento or San Francisco to get better flights and many people around here don't want to make that long cumbersome drive. The terminal hasn't been updated since 1998 but all that was remodeled restrooms and new seats and carpeting. We desperately need a larger airport with more flights and parking options.,Negative,Positive

There are not enough seats, except if you fly non-Shengen. Great advertising for Europe incapacity to treat with a minimal decency travelers spending their cash in this island. The spectacle of people and children laying everywhere in the floor in overcrowded rooms with no or not enough AC feels like being in a third world country hospital after a disaster.

No regard for covid or personal space. However, there is barely space to move around so they don't have a choice really. There aren't enough options to sit and eat. The bathrooms have a toilet roll device that doesn't work. I literally open all doors to find one where it is still functioning. About 30% of flush buttons are missing leaving holes in the wall.

When in Riga we have asked one of the ground crew to give us the stroller, which was five meters from him, telling him that we are in transit and we don't have any other luggage. He refused us telling us that is not his problem and he don't care.We have asked couple of times, after he just turned his back and left. We have asked two other ground crew and they have tell us that we need to go to pick up the stroller from the luggage hall. We have asked inside the airport four different staff members and received four different answers of how to proceed none of them making sense. In the end we have exit the airport, retrieve the stroller, going through security again with three children just because they don't ""care"".

The alley had no AC but a glass roof it was incredible sweaty to stand in a pushy crowd just to get your passport checked. Around there were kids, mothers with babies and older people heavily breathing. Who builds a glass house in a sunny country as waiting area?

Not much use for someone wanting to use their remaining Brazilian Reals. You could, in fact, use them but had to convert the prices to see how overpriced things were and if you could afford it. The few other small shops were all closing during the evening so missed out on trade. Had to queue approx 1hr 50mins for a midnight flight even though it appeared that it was the only flight due to depart. Only 4 check in desks open which became effectively 2 when two sets of people were there for over 20 minutes.

If you don't have a clear bag and put your liquids in the tray they throw them away, obviously telling you it's their policy afterwards where they fail to tell you any of this before security. I'd put a 75ml face cream in the tray and he threw it in the bin after the scanner then sarcastically told me it's my own fault as liquids need a clear bag. Contradictory to his comment he had no issues with the toothpaste, nasal spray and lip balm being in my bag. His colleague prior to this told me the stuff I had would be fine.

Rome Fiumicino,airport,A Ahmed,2024-09-03,"The minimum connection time at this airport is dishonest and not doable at all. It is technically 40 minutes, and ITA sells itineraries that meet this requirement but more than likely you will miss your connecting flight if you are transiting and have to go through passport control - we only caught our connecting flight to London after landing from Palermo due it being delayed. The e-gates which I am allowed to use as a British citizen don't work most of the time, I noticed several British citizens being rejected and sent to the manual desks which are understaffed with only half open despite a massive snaking queue full of transit passengers of various nationalities from morning bank of flights. I only made my flight after pleading with staff member and showing my boarding card that I was connecting with a short connection time. Lastly what doesn't help with connecting efficiently is the constant use of remote stands for planes instead of the many empty airbridges - you have a long wait for buses to arrive to pick everyone up from the plane, which then idles for ages, before taking long circuitous route to the terminal to drop you off. It's madness to do this in this day and age and with so many empty airbridges that could be used, not to mention the issues for less able passengers with diminished mobility.",Negative,Positive

Salzburg,airport,M Mckeon,2019-03-10,On arrival on Sat 2nd. March we had to queue outside the building then inside the building for a total of 30 mins to get through passport control - two unmanned counters on what I assume is busiest slot of week and season! No signs at luggage reclaim as to where to collect skis- found out from another passenger that they are left outside the terminal building in the bus park. On flight home one week later even more chaotic with skis - 80 metre queue outside terminal 2 with people directed to join it to check skis in. People in front confirmed we were in the right queue. After about 15 mins in this queue we came across a small sign that said this queue was for TUI and other charter carriers. Asked Crystal rep and he confirmed we were in the wrong queue and that we should check in skis with rest of luggage in Jet2 check in desks. One hour later the woman at checkout said that I should now rejoin the queue outside to drop off my now labelled skis. Fortunately by now the queue outside was only about 40 metres long so I resigned myself to about another 25 mins waiting. My prayers were answered by a helpful Crystal rep who said that I should take my skis back inside an ring a bell on a door to the right and simply hand my skis over. I was overjoyed when this worked. I was then able to help out some fellow Brits who had also been misinformed by check-in desk staff. A few signs in the airport would be much appreciated. I will try to avoid using Salzburg airport again as it is incapable of handling the passenger numbers in the ski season. It seems it is happy to take the money but unwilling to provide the service.

Decent airports have water available in drinking fountains and refill stations for free. In addition to the obscene cost it is an environmental issue.

Santiago De Chile,airport,Vitalii Kozlenkov,2024-01-08,"Can’t understand how LATAM sell tickets with connection of 1 hour 20 minutes if just to leave the first national terminal takes 30 minutes by walking without waiting in the lines. Just walking for 30 minutes if you are in a hurry and need to go for the next flight. There are almost no signs in airport if you want to make connections. Inside of the airport on the ground floor (which is for arrivals - don’t know why all few signs from one terminal to another for transfer providing you to incorrect floor) you don’t know how to reach another floor with departures and need to ask someone of the staff. The Staff is very unprofessional. I was lost and had 40 minutes for the next flight and went to the staff of LATAM, the guy was watching my boarding pass and trying to understand how to help me when I just asked where is the zone of boarding and then he told me that I’m late for my flight and boarding is closed. The best thing is that when I was in the gate in 10 minutes there was the sign BOARDING but it was not boarding yet. Really the worst airport",Negative,Positive

Santiago De Chile,airport,7 reviewsSerge Grynkewich,2023-04-22,"Santiago has opened a new terminal and this was my first time to use it. I found it to be large and the walk from the airbridge to immigration very long - especially after a long flight. Immigration was a rapid process, following which there was a form to complete and then one proceeded to baggage claim. All of this went smoothly. However, the ride that I had booked from the airport to my hotel failed to show at the place I was advised to wait and at the appointed time. While looking for my car and driver who never showed, I was beset upon by a host of persons displaying what they called ""government issued IDs"", offering me transportation assistance. This proved to be nothing but a rip off and it is my strongest advice that persons arriving in Santiago avoid these people. I highly recommend booking a ride in advance and obtaining contact details in case you have difficulty meeting up with the driver and be sure your phone is on roaming mode so that you can call your ride if needed. I repeat: avoid people offering any assistance and displaying alleged official badges or IDs. They will swarm upon you as you leave the terminal. They can be very persistent. It is a racket and leaves a bad taste for Santiago's airport in one's mouth.",Negative,Positive
Santiago De Chile,airport,B Andrews,2023-01-03,"One of the worst experiences at an airport ever. First of all, the airport doesn’t serve alcohol and won’t allow you to purchase any for drinking at duty free. Next, they had a bunch of extra security checks and even dumped all our water at a check right before boarding. The flight also left late. Overall, it was unfriendly and rude and made us feel like middle school students getting punished for nothing (eg, filling our water bottles to have hydration on the flight). We’ve been through multiple airports in Chile and they’ve all been great experiences - this is not a Chile issue. It’s a Santiago airport issue. Really upsetting and won’t be traveling through here again if we can help it.",Negative,Positive
Santo Domingo,airport,T Robinson,2019-01-08,"I have been using the Las Americas Airport for more than 18 years and over recent years with much more trepidation. On my last departure, the Friday before Christmas, I arrived before 3pm for a flight to Madrid leaving at 5.20pm, travelling business class. After clearing security it took more than 70 minutes to get through the immigration people and at 4.15 I was called to go to the departure gate where I was escorted to the downstairs baggage area because I was told they wished to search my bag which was not locked. I could see my suitcase but no one wanted to sit down so I waited for more than 30 minutes and there I witnessed young security men opening cases and throwing items all over the table and floor. They opened Christmas presents of people flying to Europe, they opened cigarette packets and emptied the cigarettes on the table, they opened baby food and destroyed much, and laughed in the faces of the passengers. Finally I saw a terminal worker from my airline and asked her to try to get someone to inspect my case. A customs official came and found only clothes and wanted to know why my case needed to be inspected when it had gone through the x-ray machines as had all the other cases. I was the last person to board my flight and the flight attendants all told me of their dread of Santo Domingo airport, try to avoid it.",Negative,Positive

We were then questioned in a side room where they laid down the money on a table that was completely broken. A young security guard then took $100 from us and told us we were OK to proceed. Also there was about 50 people trying to fill out the customs card and the pens didn’t work. Staff didn’t care. We then had lunch as was told were not able to leave a tip on a credit card.

Duty Free used to be cheap but not anymore. I have flown out of Santorini 3 times. The time before it was dirty with blocked toilets and rubbish everywhere. Now it is a better building but not a better experience. The time before that I was allowed to leave the departure gate to spend my Drachmas on a final couple of cans of beer.

There was no AC so it was hot and sweaty as well. To grab the bus into town you have to walk half a kilometer to the domestic terminal.

Sao Paulo Guarulhos,airport,G Yazmin,2022-03-04,"The airport is not friendly for the elderly, sick, or incapacitated. Basically if you have to be fit to power walk a marathon - you might make it to your flight as a result or teetering on the edge of racing in. The design of this airport makes it so that most terminals are extremely far and sometimes up to 1 hour away from check in point. If you speak English/Spanish people don't make a considerable effort to help. I'm guessing to much drinkee drinkee and sun bathing really gets people in such a relaxed mood they barely care about their work. This is the sense I got from almost every Brazilian I kindly encountered for directions and guidance. The card reader at the covid clinic did not accept my international visa chase card and so I was not able to have a covid antigen test that was very much needed for boarding. I went to money exchange center and they could only give me dollars for reals. So basically my funds were blocked and I could not pay for the test that I needed to board the plane. All in all a terrible experience with up to 4 people telling me to go in opposing directions.",Neutral,Positive

I was stranded in this airport for more than 6 hours due to fog which Sarajevo suffers during the winter months of December to February. It is funny kind of similar to the rest of Sarajevo in regards to hospitality. They are either very friendly with a big smile or just very ]rude and disinterested. For example the people at currency exchange information desk baggage claim and check in just couldn't stop smiling. But the people at the security and ticket counters were rude. Ticket counter agents any request such as air fare inquiry schedules etc. creates extra stress for them that they make you feel guilty for being a human being! For instance the lady at the Croatia Airlines ticket counter all I wanted was the air fare from Sarajevo to Munich and she rudely yells at me and say we do not sell tickets from Sarajevo which doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever.,Negative,Positive

Empty taxi's dribbled in and veronica, always with a smile bellowed out the next name on the list is all directions. People were growing impatient with the pace and the next taxi to show up was a mini van. After exchanging a few private words with the driver, Veronica changed strategies, put her list down and bellowed anyone going to ""fill in the blank"", in my case downtown, ""hop in"". I got a ride with 2 other fares in a van after only 1/2 hr wait. Way to problem solve Veronica. Everyone wins including the taxi driver who made a few extra$$.

The woman at Thrifty counter was beyond helpful she made this experience so seamless and easy. The lady at the exit point for ticket collecting was rude and unprofessional.

I was certainly concerned reading all the previous reviews. However I didn’t experience any real issues. The airport is very large so easy to find a quiet spot, there are plenty of power outlets, and getting online is extremely simple, you just log on and take a pic of your passport. Granted, you won’t be able to do very much online unless you’ve got one of the VPNs that work behind the great China firewall, but if you have an iPad with a couple of movies downloaded the time will soon pass. There was a reasonable amount of shops open both for coffee and souvenir shopping. The train that you’ll need to take to get to your gate is frequent, clean and fast.

Shanghai Pudong,airport,Kara Garcia,2024-02-24,"We were transiting through to Tokyo from London Gatwick. Immediately upon arrival, we were herded into a corridor with lots of other people trying to transit to other flights and given zero information. After some time, which we could have spent navigating the Airport independently, we were herded to the transit section. This whole process was a massive time suck and not needed, it felt like they didn't trust foreigners to navigate the airport on their own. The whole feel of the place is very eery. We both felt on edge as they monitor everything with an excessive amount of cameras watching/recording you constantly. We had to endure so many painfully long queues that seemed illogical. We were getting a transfer but we had to go through the exact same processes we had already cleared 12 hrs prior in London Gatwick. Our liquids and hand luggage was intensely scrutinised, even though, again, we were cleared at London Gatwick. We had to constantly show our boarding pass, provide lots of personal information and photos constantly, and it all felt quite invasive. It felt like a massive overkill. We thought having a layover of 2.5 hours would be plentiful, however we ended up, after enduring the most surreal and stress inducing transfer we've ever been through, with only 15 mins to catch our flight. It seems, judging from previous reviews, I was lucky to be able to buy 3 drinks prior to getting our flight, as we were desperately thirsty, using my card, but, again, I had to sign things, and it was a very elongated process. I am dreading our return journey. No one speaks English, they seem unconcerned about time pressures with flight transfers, and while we saw quite literally over 20 members of staff congregating at various points in the airport, they have minimal staff processing flyers. The presence of so many staff loitering around is also intimidating, as is very intensive security procedures I.e. everyone goes through the metal detector gate but noone escapes a pat down. It so excessive and massive overkill. You cannot access the ""free wifi' unless you are prepared to give more personal info, like your phone number or passport details with current photo, and if you do take that deal, everything is blocked unless it's a Chinese website, so massive issues of censorship here, which is deeply uncomfortable. I would not recommend unless you are into the vibe of a dystopian escape room.",Negative,Positive

The debacle began the second we left the plane, where we were subjected to long queues and no apparent wifi connectivity. The staff slap a sticker on you without consent and herd you like cattle to the transit area. The best description of the transit area is a skeleton. Yes, it is modern and clean with the initial appearance of many shops and restaurants, but spend more than 5 minutes there and you will realise there is hardly anywhere to eat, where the food is inedible, and there is hardly anywhere to shop, and the staff don't speak English. So, to pass the time, we decided to splurge on entry into the airport lounge. However, we were told (in broken English) that they only accept Chinese yuan for entry. Slightly annoyed, we asked where we could withdraw cash or exchange foreign currency, the staff member advised there was no ATMs nor currency exchange outlets in the airport. So if you want to spend more than 5 minutes in a place with barely any edible food, a smoking room resembling a scene from Black Mirror (Gulag-like environment covered with security cameras) and that simply makes you hate life, then I recommend a transit at Shanghai Pudong.",Negative,Positive

The nearest boading gate only meters from security check and the airport is full of shops and restaurants - chinese style. But it's sad to see the airport is kind of showing it's age now - only completed in 2002 or so. I think this is due to the fact that the construction quality is not up to standard. The new T2 is adjacent to the abundant T1 which is now looks like a ghost airport terminal itself. Apart from that SHE is an airport which is being well used.,Negative,Positive

Asked nearly everybody in the queue, not interest. Eventually got through to customs, asked again where Transit area is, just say 4th floor. Went to 4th floor, don't see any transit area, went to Information Counter, nobody speaks English. Very hesitant to help. Again asked everyone if they speak English so they can translate for me, nothing. Went back to Information again, the lady took me to Check in counter, issued me with a ticket, kept saying must check in. Asked what must I do, she eventually wrote on her phone ""your luggage has no business here"" so said I know but I did not collect my luggage because in all my other international flights, your luggage gets put on the next plane on your connecting flight. My luggage from JHB has got a big yellow tag with ""TRANSFER"" attached. So I presumed that it will be put on the plane to Chengdu. Meanwhile by now I am stressing out because my luggage was not collected downstairs. Was told to go to ground floor to collect my luggage, went into the lift, it only went to the 2nd floor, ran around and can't find a lift going down. Went to the 4th floor again and asked the lady to help me. They do not seem interested. I kept asking and asking people standing around too. Nobody is interested in assisting. One security man was standing there so I kept asking him and he said to follow him, we went to a restricted area, waiting for a while and eventually he managed to get my luggage to me. I had to run and check the luggage in again, nearly missed my connecting flight. There should be English speaking staff at the Information Counter. Was so frustrating too, checked in my luggage, I asked where is Gate 3, the girl working behind the counter said ""Read"".

Sialkot International,airport,FM Khan,2021-08-17,"Its a newly built airport in Sialkot, operates international flights to various destinations around the globe. Staff are local and helpful. Entrance to the airport car park may take a bit longer but that is due to security checks at the entrance as the airport is located near Sambrial city and security staff allows only one attendant with each passenger. (some locals use this opportunity as a picnic spot which is unnecessary).",Positive,Negative
Siem Reap,airport,Steve Caddi,2024-02-08,"Very modern, lots of space etc. Luggage arrived from aircraft quickly. Still the very antiquated way of processing visas, ie 3 windows, 3 queues to suffer, fortunately we were at the front, then queue up again for immigration. The really bad bit about this airport is its distance from Siem Reap itself, nearly 50kms. $35 usd by car and nearly an hours drive. A nice new road leading from the airport that then connects to the bumpy, ramshackle main road for the rest of the journey. For most tourists, the old airport was far more convenient, by a big margin.",Negative,Positive
Simara,airport,8 reviewsAlok Mishra,2024-04-22,"This airport operates the shortest duration flights in Nepal to and from the capital Kathmandu. The aircrafts that it receives is mostly ATR 42/72 operated by domestic carrier Buddha Air or Jetstream/ ATR operated by Yeti Airlines. The airport has very basic facilities, a small hall with few check in counters dedicated to the domestic carriers, a common seating area, to accommodate 50 to 70 people, few toilets before and after security checks. Luggage is delivered on trolleys, one canteen outside, small parking area outside, one short runway for about 20 take offs and landing combined. Very basic of airports one could imagine.",Positive,Negative
Simferopol,airport,A Kora,2010-01-08,Poor domestic and international terminals due to inattentive and almost hostile services though domestic terminal is more pleasant in style. Expect very long queues on domestic departures both during check in and security control. On international departures I have come across numerous very nasty passport control policewomen. It is better to wear a face with no emotions and not to answer back even if you feel you are being insulted and walk away once your passport is stamped. On international arrivals you can save almost 30 minutes if you grab an immigration form early and get in the queue before filling the form since incoming arrivals passport control is much slower than you will see anywhere in the western world. You can fill your form in the queue on a magazine.,Negative,Positive
Skiathos,airport,20 reviewsP Gamberger Loncaric,2015-09-18,"Skiathos Airport is one of the smallest airports. The arrivals area has one luggage belt and you are outside in no time. Departure area as well is very small and the same staff that are checking your bags at the departure hall before you check in, are also the security staff. So when they are done in one part of the hall they go to the other part where they open the security checks. It looks funny, since they are jumping up and down the hall, but airport is really very small and very manageable. There is no playground for children and toilet facilities are basic. There is only one shop at the departure hall where check ins are. Everything is very relaxed. They have no fingers, so expect to board the plane on foot from the boarding gate. Walking distance to the airplane is a few hundred meters.",Positive,Negative
Skopje,airport,E Kurminova,2024-05-06,Horrendous. Bought priority boarding with Wizz. There was absolutely no distinction between priority and no priority. Families with prams and little children were among the last ones to board “thanks” to the disorganisation of the airport. Instructions were shouted in Macedonian and no English. I feel robbed and Wizz should feel robbed as well. This is no airport experience I would feel ashamed to fly there. Travesty!,Negative,Positive
Sofia,airport,R Vines,2024-03-10,"I am happy to say that I didn't encounter any problems with the staff at Sofia Airport, though I did create a problem of my own. I assumed that Ryanair used Terminal 1 and only realized my mistake after 10 minutes of failing to find my flight on the departure board. There are no signs to Terminal 2, and it is a rather convoluted walk through a car park and along a couple of busy roads. The walk took me 30 minutes, with only minimal luggage. When I rechecked Google Maps later, the route offered was close to two hours. (I read online that there is a shuttle bus every 30 minutes, but I didn't see any sign of that, either.) Once I was in the right terminal, the security and passport lines moved at reasonable speed, and the staff were professional, if not overly friendly. My arrival was also fine, though I did get stuck in a passport queue when the unfriendly immigration officer took against the passenger ahead of me.",Negative,Positive
Sofia,airport,P Porter,2023-11-10,"OK. First impressions on arrival were neutral. A somewhat dated airport by appearance, linking to reflections of the 1970s where I was a youngster. Anyway, as a frequent air traveller with Partially Restricted Mobility (PRM) I am acutely conscious of the fact that having metal inside my body following reconstructive surgery is likely to activate the security metal detection archway. So it happened at Sofia Airport. Despite showing a medical card and explaining my medical situation I was then forced through the default procedure adopted by less progressive countries. So, in this case remove shoes and jumper; despite both being clothe. Of course this does not stop the activation on reentering the archway. So, with PRM I have to remove footwear (I have restricted mobility) and suffer the indignity of further removal of clothing (in public) which exposes sensitive (to me) tissue scarring, and then repeated attempts to not activate the machine. Do I need to go thro’ naked? Why is the default not to immediately use the handheld metal detector for people with declared PRM? At progressive airports this has been my experience and avoids embarrassment, whilst treating PRM people with dignity. Of course, ideally fully body X-ray machines would completely eradicate this issue. Shame on you, Sofia Airport security staff. Don’t just default to basic principles; have a progressive and appropriate security protocol for passengers with PRM.",Negative,Positive
Southampton,airport,John Clift,2024-04-19,It does not matter how you look at this place the saying you cannot polish a turd reflects the airport 101%. Everybody staff wise encountered departing and arriving clearly have nothing but disdain for the passengers traveling through the place.

Southampton,airport,E Vardani,2019-12-09,"I recently had a return trip from Southampton airport for a trip to Amsterdam, flying with Flybe. The trip didn't start very well, as I realized upon arriving at the airport at 5.30 a.m. that had overbooked for the short stay parking by a week. I asked the two employees at the information desk who I could contact to change my booking or get a partial refund and was given a card with customer services number - which didn't open until 9 a.m. (by that time I was already in Amsterdam). Then proceeded to queue for luggage check-in for about 30 minutes - which for such a small airport is quite a long time. I called the customer service number as soon as the call center opened and was told to send an email with my request to a different department, which I did and didn't think anything more of during my trip. Upon my arrival back to Southampton airport, I noticed that my luggage had been very badly damaged during the trip back and went straight to the help desk, where a gentleman wrote down some information and gave me a leaflet with information for ""lost/late luggage"" - again, didn't think anything of it, as I was told someone would contact me soon and it was by that time almost 11 p.m. A week later and I've called customer services twice about the refund (each time being given a new email address to send my request to), not heard anything about replacing the luggage, and no idea when I'll be able to get anything sorted because the different departments apparently don't speak to each other. Generally, not too happy.",Negative,Positive

Split,airport,Pierre de Wet,2023-05-22,What a great experience visiting Split and I fell in love with Croatia - so sad when we got to the airport to discover all the charger ports to charge a phone simply does not work - not the plugs clearly made available nor the usb ports. Well bad luck I thought - though strange so many are out of action. Went on to look for a water fountain - none found - ok - ill buy a bottle of water (sad it will create plastic waste - hey ho) one place only selling water with a massively long queue - Hang on Ill ask 2 nice friendly looking ladies clearly airport staff …”excuse me I asked - is there perhaps a water fountain?” No came the answer … “you can drink water from the taps in the toilets - its drinkable” - clearly she found that very amusing as she laughed to her colleague and walked off. I then asked another airport staff member and he told me the same - I then asked if they do not find many people ask him for a water fountain - yes he said but our managers know this and they said that they will not allow water fountains. So sad how much waste water bottles are created and so sad that a great time in Split is now tarnished by a silly water fountain - but more so some of the rude staff at the airport - my advice - Split airport management - your culture of your company stink - look in the mirror to what cause this!,Negative,Positive
Split,airport,Natalja Panko,2022-10-31,"Absolutely the rudest airport staff I ever came across in my travel experience. I was catching a flight from Split to London Luton on 24th of October at 22.25. When I approached the check-in desk the lady was talking and laughing on the phone with her friend for at least few minutes while I was just standing there and waiting for her finish. After she finally was done, she told me that my flight is full and that she will need to take my bag. I had a speedy boarding ticket with EasyJet and a large cabin bag to take on the flight for which I payed £40 pounds. Anyways, I gave away my bag, and after boarding the flight I saw that it is actually half empty! I approached EasyJet flight attendant and told her my situation, she was in shock and said that they had no right to take my bag even if the flight would be full because I am in S1 category and that I will be getting a full refund for that. On top of that my bag arrived in horrible condition, it is quite pricey and now EasyJet will have to provide me with compensation for mistakes of Split Airport staff.

The physical building and TSA staffing can not handle the volume of passengers. When flights are departing/arriving, every inch of the building is full of people. It is a fire hazard and impossible for people to move through the terminal. As a result, one needs to plan for spending hours there to get to your gate and then the flight will most likely also be late in departing. If you need to check luggage, it is even more of a nightmare. Parking and signage is also inadequate.",Negative,Positive

First of all, there are no self kiosks anywhere, so even if you don’t have luggage you have to wait for the check in counters and they only open two hours before the flight. (International flight). We had to wait on our feet for a long time and its exhausting. The personnel in general were not friendy or helpful, they like to ignore you a lot. They are uneducated and very rude. Almost no one knows English and they don’t care about this. They act as if everyone should know Russian. Police at the passport checks don’t even understand basic words like yes and no. They can’t commumicate with you. An airport and personnel like this doesn’t suit such a beautiful place like St Petersburg. It feels like a local airport. One suspects how this airport could be an international airport that is hosting the world cup this year. It would be an ok local airport but it doesn’t deserve to be called an “International airport”.",Positive,Negative

Stockholm-skavsta,airport,Jose Lopez,2011-05-04,This airport is nowhere near Stockholm. I was charged 1300SEK (About Â£110) to get a taxi into central Stockholm as it's 105 kms away. There are no taxis available on the rank outside and calling for one on the phone on the wall took forever and when they arrive they park up across the road and it's up to you to go and ask each driver and they arrive it they are there for you. The bags did come out very quickly but this is a very small plus considering the distance the airport is from the real Stockholm.

Subang Kuala Lumpur,airport,S Irving,2018-11-16,"I used the Subang Skypark Terminal for the first time on 14th October 2018. An encounter with a rude staff member at the baggage screening area spoilt the experience for me. At about 9.30 am, I queued up to place my carry-on luggage into a tray for screening. Assuming that the contents of the tray (with my identification documents) would be visually inspected and the tray moved along the conveyor belt by a staff, as required in many airports around the world, I proceeded to walk through the metal detecting arch. I was stopped by a female officer in her 20s who in an aggressive voice, asked, “Mana IC? [Where is your (Malaysian) identification card?]”. I returned to my tray to get my identification card and then walked up to the same officer who said loudly, in the earshot of everyone at the screening area , “Siapa tolak beg u? [Who is pushing your bag?]"". I was startled by the hostility and before I could make some sense of the situation, she yelled in a louder tone at me, “One by one!”. To provide context, I am a Malaysian national who has lived abroad for 16 years. It was my fourth day back in Malaysia after several years and I was not familiar, especially as a first-time user of the Subang airport, with the current local procedure or practice at the baggage screening area. Regardless of this, the officer’s aggression was uncalled for. I am writing this not to shame, but to stress and remind of the importance of a professional, polite and courteous service and conduct, especially for people-facing roles in airports. Security check work may be hard and stressful, but that does not excuse rude behaviour loaded with a baggage of anger, prejudice and presumptions by a person in uniform. I urge the management to work with the relevant departments and authorities to improve staff training in professionalism and etiquette.",Negative,Positive

Surabaya Juanda,airport,P James,2019-10-09,"Arrived from SIN to T2 Taxi time to gate was quick. Despite the reputation in advance, the Immigration process was very efficient (please learn Changi) presumably because I had got the right visa. And then it was off to get my bags, bags got there quickly. Customs was a bit shambolic as people were pulled aside. I got through quickly and then all hell broke loose as I entered the terminal building. Lots of hustling on taxis etc, but went to the Bluebird desk and no taxi unless I took a great deal on an upgraded taxi. So I took it, absolute bedlam outside with significant risk of being run over. On way back chaos to get into the terminal. More security before I checked in. Check-in queues Ok. Head upstairs and I am now in a parallel universe. The exec lounge is dreadful and sits outside the final security cleared area so no thoughts of going for a walk to do shopping. Get through into departure area gates and there is minimal seating, minimal shopping, certainly no bar and very basic food outlets. In my opinion, this airport is very basic, quite functional but on departure, you want to minimise time spent there",Negative,Positive

Taipei Songshan,airport,Graeme Bray,2015-08-11,"Decided to fly via Kinmen to mainland China instead of HKG. This required using Taipei's older Songshan Airport instead of Taoyuan Airport. Access to the airport is very quick and easy using the Taipei Metro direct to the front of the airport, something that Taoyuan is yet to get. I used the Domestic Terminal, which is odd in many ways as the domestic arrangements in Taiwan do not follow an international standard. For a start there is a 10KG limit, despite the airline's website saying 20KG was okay (the error was simply a copy and paste from the airline international sister airline and followed international rules). The Check-In counter were arranged in small islands however after getting your boarding pass, you then had to go to another counter along the airside wall for your baggage. While the queue was almost non-existent, why it can not be done at the same counter at the same time defies logic. Baggage tags simply state the name of your destination in English and Chinese, no bar codes and no straight forward ability for transferring to other flights. Due to the limited space on the airside gates, passengers are asked to wait in the Check-In Hall where there are amble lounges and 7Eleven convenience store. When your flight number appears above the Security Door, you can then proceed through to your gate. Flights are very frequent and regular, so this was not a great issue and waiting by the gate or the lounge makes little difference. Overall it was efficient and quick, despite it's quirky nature. On my return flight, the baggage hall housed two belts and the bags appeared quickly enough and I was through and on the metro back into Taipei in little time.",Negative,Positive

The only good thing about the airport is that it is fairly modern. Other than that, the service is absolutely atrocious and makes me cautious and embarrassed to invite anyone to visit the country. Staff are snappy and arrogant, refusing to answer questions, or if they bother to acknowledge your presence, you get a snarky remark spat at your face. Also, the only airport in Europe where I have experienced hands being literally shoved down my trousers. This is why I try to wear dresses whenever I’m forced to use the airport.

The country was a wonderful place to visit full of good people, however the men checking your bags are hateful, condescending and outright disrespectful. I don’t mind it I can take it but to talk to my wife the way they did is unacceptable. Low quality, ignorant staff, it’s a horrible representation of such a beautiful country to deal with these people.",Negative,Positive
Tbilisi,airport,C Hajer,2024-03-13,"Staff are very rude. They checked me thoroughly and ask to open my bag and not to touch anything, i was just standing there and they are also checking the other passengers coming, after 15 mins i ask the security if i can go and get my bag she said “oh, yes you can, i forgot”.  She made me wait for nothing. They have an overpriced for their food inside the airport. I will share this experience to my colleagues and other friends.",Positive,Negative
Tbilisi,airport,Stuart Clapham,2023-02-02,Modern airport generally fine. On arrival the taxi situation is uncontrolled resulting in rip-off cabs (I ended up angrily being demanded 100 GEL on arrival in Tbilisi for a 20 GEL journey). They seem to try to block Bolt which doesn’t seem to work. On departure good luck finding a coffee for less than $6 in any café - seems to be run by a cartel.,Negative,Positive
Tbilisi,airport,Hayssam EL Amin,2022-07-14,"Reading all the bad reviews I cannot help but agree on how rude and unprofessional the airport staff is. Check in staff eating pumpkin seeds, security staff with a massive ego, and immigration officers acting in a disrespectful manner. Even the food and beverage staff have no clue about service and hospitality. Being such a beautiful tourist destination, you would think service is a priority, but we found it very disappointing. Good food, great nature, and not the warmest people.",Negative,Positive

Tehran Imam Khomeini,airport,Hossein Nikou,2017-03-16,"Tehran IKA Airport looks like an isolated domestic terminal rather than international. Arrival immigration is small and if two or more flights arrive at the same time, it will be chaos. Baggage conveyor belts are limited to three which seems no maintenance has been performed for a long time. At the same place the toilets are dirty most of the time. The departure section is little better in comparison of Arrival. Wi-fi is free but could not be used at all. Passengers security checks are conducted two times! Departure section is a little bit organized. The airport website is just in Persian language! Finding a car park is so hard. At the time writing review, no public transportation except taxi are accessible. In comparison of other region airport like Dubai, Qatar and Istanbul airports, IKA is messy.",Negative,Positive
Tehran Mehrabad,airport,Michael Davies,2010-07-12,Departing on 8am flight to Kerman. All bags X-ray'd before you enter the terminal. There was one queue for my flight and only one person checking everyone in but she was fantastically efficient and once at the head of the queue the process must have taken only 30 seconds. Amazingly people behind me were thrusting their tickets at her whilst she was dealing with me. Airside departure lounge was full and despite a lot of seats very few free. There seemed to be about 6 flight leaving at the same time as mine. The lounge reminded me of a 1970's bus depot. Plenty of shops around to get souvenirs and snacks although I didn't use them. It is a small affair and all gates are in the one area. Toilets were grim with long queues. Go before you arrive! Flight information screens toggled between English and farsi but the English version stayed on screen about 5% of the time. It seemed I was the only European person there. Suddenly the screen above the departure door flashed up for my flight. Bus to the plane for an on time departure. On the return journey bus journey back to the terminal and baggage re- claim was very fast. I was out of the airport within 20 minutes of landing. Some taxi offices in the arrivals building. Overall Mehrabad is a place to catch a domestic flight no more no less. A long delay would be a nightmare here. The transfer to the international airport is about an hour through heavy Tehran traffic.,Positive,Negative
Tehran Mehrabad,airport,Michael Moxley,2004-01-18,Mehrabad airport is an old and small airport that shows its age. The tarmac is worn out and inside terminal 2 is very dark and boring . Duty free shops are expensive and there's not a good eatery at the gates. Also I noticed security was taken easier than other airports given that I walked through the metal detector and it beeped but nobody apparently cared. I also noticed that their body search was very basic. On another occasion upon return I walked into the Homa class lounge without having proper authority and no one seemed to care. In the lounge although nice looking there was nothing special. All in all it's a tolerable airport but far from being a world class gateway. I am hoping to see the brand new airport opened in my next trip to Iran this summer.,Positive,Negative

Three stood around talking while one worker worked through the line in the slowest possible manner I can imagine. I have been standing in the line for 30 minutes and there are still 10 people ahead of me. Check in was no different. There were only 4 people in front of me but it took 40 minutes to get me.

Tianjin Binhai,airport,S Liu,2012-04-02,The new terminal is a big step up compared to the old one but still it does not give the passengers a warm feeling. It's big and but feels small crowed and untidy comparing to Incheon Int'l airport. Most of the facilities are not well designed. Signs are confusing and some do not make sense. Most staff are unfriendly. International departure area is not an open design: passenger need to go through a door to check in at the counter and if you want to come out you have to go through the same door again totally unnecessary.

Bus tickets should be bought from a kiosk - these are usually located near tram stops. It was a short 30 minute ride to the airport. It's a bit of a comically small airport, with a handful of check in desks. With hand luggage only, I went straight to security (2 lines available). The security guard told me (incorrectly) by liquids bag was oversized so I had to dispose of some items. Not a problem given it was the end of my trip but a little annoying given there was not a legitimate issue. Security was quick nonetheless There aren't many facilities in the airport. A couple of small shops are there, not extortionately priced. There is no drinkable tap water to fill bottles. There are not many toilets. Seating could be tight if there were multiple flights. Communication for boarding was clear and we departed as scheduled.",Positive,Negative

Tivat,airport,Alison Meredith,2023-05-16,What a dump. Queues going in all directions. From outside you have to get through the queue to security to access the gates. Your own boarding pass is not acceptable they throw it back at you and give you one of theirs. People queued 10 wide to get through security manned by 1 person. The gate number on the boarding pass is not the one used. The airport departure lounge was pouring with rain inside. No information and nowhere to get out of the way.,Negative,Positive
Tivat,airport,Harun Rathore,2019-10-17,"Tivat Airport is the busier of the two international airports in Montenegro. It serves the coastal area of the country. The airport seems to have two terminals of which I only saw one. The airport caters mostly for charter flights from European countries as well as Russia and Israel. On arrival, all passengers can make their way to the terminal. In Tivat, no buses are used. The baggage claim went pretty quickly, but they do not adhere to the priority labeling on the baggage. Within 5 minutes after leaving the aeroplane, I was outside. A week later, I checked in early for my Lufthansa flight to Munich, so there was no crowd at the check-in counter and at the security and passport control either. At check-in, I was misinformed about the possibility of using the airport lounge. It proved that Lufthansa – as one of the few airlines serving Tivat Aiport – has no contract with the lounge. The things you can do in the waiting area are very limited. There is one large duty-free shop in the departure hall but no café or snack bar where people can buy some food or refreshments, which is a real shame. However, I later noticed that some fellow passengers had gone through security control with their drinks, which means Montenegro’s authorities do not stop you from taking drinks from outside on board. Good to know for the next time! Boarding went swiftly and again all passengers were asked to walk the short way to the aeroplane.",Negative,Positive

Tokyo Narita,airport,1 reviewsT Magdalene,2023-01-06,"Departing from this international airport post Covid is a nightmare with everything closed including the immigration check-in for departure and arrivals unless it is after 8am and before 9pm. I am not kidding when I say that there are no shops (not even duty free) or eateries open during those closed times. I was unfortunately stuck here cos of flight diversion on 1 Jan 2023. Normally I would stay at the airport since it's just 1 night. Non-Japanese were asked to fend for themselves with no assistance provided whatsoever by the staff. To put salt to wound, the non-Japanese passengers were only told that there are no overnight accommodation arrangements made after the Japanese passengers were dealt with, which was by that time, around 8.30-9pm (which was how I saw that the entire airport was unmanned from 9pm). So in short, avoid this airport if you need an early or late flight out cos you might just not be able to make it with their limited staffing.",Negative,Positive
Tontouta,airport,Patrick Callioni,2006-01-03,Not a great airport but not the worst either. The only really bad aspect is the cost of food and drink - 17 Australian dollars for a stale sandwich and two cokes at a self-service cafe is over the top. The fact that smoking is allowed is also a black mark. Make sure you have arranged a transfer to and from the airport because there are few taxis and the ride is not cheap because of the distance from Noumea.,Positive,Negative

Signage is not good, baggage handling is slow and erratic and the connections to the airport are a joke - no train from the airport, multi stop bus journeys, overpriced shuttle costs (CAD 200 to N Falls). The whole concept needs a serious overhaul. But it's been like this for years.",Negative,Positive
Toronto Pearson,airport,Karen Shaw,2024-10-06,The boarding process for our Air Canada flight to London Heathrow is currently ridiculous. I am not sure who thought it was a good idea to board a flight to Frankfurt and London at adjacent gates with departures times 10 mins apart. It was crowded and hot with no place to sit. My husband is ill and it isn't a good experience at all. Comfort before a flight matters a lot. These are two long international flights as well and it is an absolute cattle car in this tiny corner of E gate.,Negative,Positive
Toronto Pearson,airport,Sophia Jordan Mowery,2024-09-05,"Like many of the other comments about poor organization, there are specific problems that can fix the mess of confusion. First signage in Terminal 3 as to where hotel shuttle buses are located for specific hotels. Adding list of hotels with phone numbers. I arrived late 10:30 pm and asked 8 different airport employees and everyone said something different. I was not the only one as tens of people where calling their hotels to ask and others still asking airport staff. After 40 minutes. I took a cab. Save your staff and your customers both time and frustration. The other problem is the lack of signage for KLM and AIR FRANCE check in counter in advance of flight. No one knew where to line up. More significantly, the absolute rudeness of airport workers hovering around (not airline staff). Who when asked, just shrugged at you or said not my job. It is not clear then what these peoples job was and if not to answer questions, then why be there. I traveled business and was directed to economy luggage drop off. I finally went to priority when it opened (2 hours later) and they were great and said the others provided incorrect information and I should have had a priority sticker. So signage and better customer service would be much appreciated and would have provided a smooth and less chaotic experience.

On the Land Side there is a café/shop supplying hot and cold snacks and other things and a seating area. It is very small so everything is within easy reach but if more than 1 plane is in at a time it could get busy.

Instead of a place to sit and have a bite to eat and a cup of coffee there is just a ton of very poor quality and expensive duty free shops which take up a ridiculous amount of space. They have the selection of the poorest corner shop in Toulouse with similar prices! This is an incredibly badly thought out airport plan.

Trapani-birgi,airport,N Caliaru,2024-07-11,"I have always respected the laws and traveled around the world, yet what happened at Trapani airport on 1 June 2024 is absolutely scandalous and against the laws. I went through the security scan wearing a summer dress, a bra, a pair of underwear and some summer sandals. The machine beeped! I was asked to pass the second time with my arms raised (never happened). Well, I did. Again it rang. A security woman was called, she came in front of me, asked if she could touch me, I said definitely no, but she grabbed my breast from underneath, grabbed it completely and I felt humiliated because my privacy was at risk not respected. I felt uncomfortable and asked her to stop touching me immediately. I told his colleagues why it's possible when it was more likely my bra that was beeping. I told her that she should use the linear machine (which in my case was used a couple of times). He told me he would make the same beep. I have traveled the world, yet in Trapani, Sicily, that machine did not work like in other places. I could say that the car is not available. Since all his colleagues were rude after I was touched and humiliated in front of all the other passengers (they stopped the line and everyone was looking at me). They told me I won't get on the flight if I don't agree to be touched. I told them the only thing that could beep was my bra.IT:Ho sempre rispettato le leggi e viaggiato in giro per il mondo, eppure quello che è successo all'aeroporto di Trapani il 1° giugno 2024 è assolutamente scandaloso e contro le leggi.

Mi è stato chiesto di passare la seconda volta con le braccia alzate (mai successo). Bene, l'ho fatto. Di nuovo suonò. È stata chiamata una donna della sicurezza, è venuta davanti a me, mi ha chiesto se poteva toccarmi, ho detto decisamente no, ma lei mi ha afferrato il seno da sotto, me lo ha afferrato completamente e mi sono sentito umiliato perché la mia privacy era a rischio non rispettato. Mi sentivo a disagio e le ho chiesto di smettere immediatamente di toccarmi. Ho detto ai suoi colleghi perché è possibile quando è più probabile che sia stato il mio reggiseno a emettere un segnale acustico. Le ho detto che avrebbe dovuto usare la macchina lineare (che nel mio caso è stata usata un paio di volte). Mi ha detto che avrebbe fatto lo stesso bip. Ho girato il mondo, eppure a Trapani, in Sicilia, quella macchina non ha funzionato come in altri posti. Potrei dire che la macchina non è disponibile. Dato che tutti i suoi colleghi sono stati scortesi dopo che sono stato toccato e umiliato di fronte a tutti gli altri passeggeri (hanno fermato la fila e tutti mi guardavano).

Toilets were worn out 2 years ago so one can only imagine how they look now after traffic increase. At 5h30am toilets were impossibly dirty which means they weren't cleaned the night before.

Tripoli,airport,K Sterry,2008-07-28,Used this airport countless times in the past 18 months. My opinion is that it has it has a long way to go before it reaches an international standard. The Libyans know this and a new one is planned and will replace the old international one in a few years. The domestic building (separate) is brand new and although spartan and modern it functions well though security checks could be speeded up and better organised. You get on a transfer bus to be ferried over to the international side where a domestic plane is parked further out. The buses are very old and on one occasion has broken down (collapsed suspension!). The international terminal leaves a lot to be desired - on arrival you are stuck at immigration for a long time and go through two guys. Then you go through screen/xray before collecting your luggage downstairs. The luggage often falls off the conveyor and you can find old luggage behind the back of the stairs! After this you arrive into the main hall which is in a drab dull olive-green plastic decor. For departing checkouts can take a long time and can be disorderly. Then it's a long wait through a myriad of security checks before leaving the green gloom for upstairs which has a better atmosphere but seating is very limited and they are cold hard metal seats. First class lounge is very good but also very busy and popular with families with kids. Gates are extremely basic and expect to change gates while they make their minds up. Don't use the loos in the gates - they are one of the worst I've seen on my travels. The whole airport is air conditioned and works well which is a must in sub-Saharan Africa.,Positive,Negative
Trivandrum,airport,Silvia Rajniak,2024-09-29,"The departure experience at the airport was not so pleasant. Firstly, at the check-in counter, the agents were confused, and it took quite a long time for them to get confirmation from the Abu Dhabi office that I didn't need a visa to the country where I was travelling. While I had already shown them three entries to the same country, they were unsure how to handle it. However, the most weird experience was at the security check. They removed ""Garam Masala"" spices from my carry-on luggage and IQos. While they allowed me to enter the country with the device, they took it away because it is banned in India. Weird, if it is forbidden, they should be allowed to take it out of the country if they did not care while coming in. But the most disappointing experience was that they did not destroy it and put it in the garbage! They kept it safely aside, so I am sure someone from the airport employees took it and used it. This is unacceptable, and such handling is a NO-GO! I wonder if the airport's management is aware of it and how they see such handling. It was just an annoying experience after such a lovely stay in Kerala. Pity.",Negative,Positive

Completely clueless. No announcements. Security only opening after 7 with only 1 line working. Straight after the polar night Half marathon. Passengers from all over the world trying to leave Tromso on an early morning flight(s) absolutely pathetic. What a disgrace to end an otherwise very enjoyable visit.,Negative,Positive
Tulsa International,airport,K Max,2020-11-20,"I have been going to college in Tulsa for 3 years, and have yet to have a flight home that didn’t get delayed.

Tulsa International,airport,1 reviewsJohn Lamb,2015-10-26,I fly American a lot. The A terminal just got a nice revamp but there is a revolving door to get out of the gate area. This is such a slow door that they have people there to let you around it about 1/2 the time. I have complained to the airport about it several times and received no reply. You would think that after spending so much money for a remodel they would fix the one big thing I hear a lot of frequent travelers complain about.,Negative,Positive
Tunis Carthage,airport,John Richards,2023-04-24,"The Airport is starting to look a bit dated now but the staff are helpful (the officials etc). Check in is pretty much the same as most airports except online check in and boarding passes are not functional as yet (or at least by my booking) I catch this flight to London every couple of weeks. Points of frustration and I’m sure it’s down to financial during these difficult times. However every time I clear check in you then go through a further passport control I find this odd as I haven’t done this anywhere else even flying in and out of neighbouring countries. Alas though there is to little staff to accommodate the passenger flow and waits and can be very long I would add an additional 30 mins to your airport time. Once through you go to security pretty standard but I often see staff just chatting and not observing the machine screens which seems to negate the very reason we all go through this security. Now my major frustration was with the duty free staff I found them rude and unwilling to help. I approached 2 lady staff and asked if they could show me the headphones of which I was pointed to an area and they resumed talking I am an Arabic speaker so I understood they were just talking of their Eid celebrations, I went to the area and no electrical items were on display so I approached the ladies again to only have eyes rolled and huffing and puffing I thanked the lady and she just stated there was nothing in stock. She then turned her back and walked off, whilst I understand people have bad days but both ladies were rude and disrespectful. I was then approached by an officer who asked if I had any money on me do t be alarmed at this but they Tunisian currency is not allowed to leave the country or so it was explained to me. Now my only area of frustration in returning through Carthage airport is the passport control the lines are exceptionally long and it takes a very long time to clear. Once you clear passport control your passport is checked again less than 10 meters later? The same security issues were noted and nobody seemed to care about monitoring screens to be checking baggage leaving the airport. This has been the way pre covid and I don’t see any improvement in standards it’s such a shame as I love this country and it sets the wrong impression to people here visiting.",Positive,Negative
Turin,airport,Mark Griffiths,2022-12-24,"Awful from front desk to boarding, airport is like a sauna, staff are rude and don’t want to be here but then there is only a handful of staff. No information for English (lucky I speak Italian) it makes you appreciate Gatwick and Heathrow",Positive,Negative
Turin,airport,F Seking,2019-02-04,"The initial impressions of departures were quite good, drop off being right next to the passenger entrances, the large number of check-in desks all centred around a baggage conveyor, using the available floor space to the max. And even security seemed well organised, with fairly thorough checks but at reasonable speed. However, things went rapidly downhill on the air side of the terminal. Toilet signage was practically non-existant. There were very few food and drink outlets for a large airport, and consequently all had massive queues waiting for service (even though it was a Sunday). The seating was totally inadequate. And if you went thru passport control to the gates in search of toilets and more food/drink outlets you’d be disappointed. Incredibly there were none at all. Airport wifi seemed impossible to log into. On the plus side there were no endless corridors to walk down to get to the gates and the airport was clean.",Negative,Positive
Udaipur,airport,Andrew Beech,2008-12-24,"An almost new airport that is reasonably efficient up to and including the security checks. Security checks are stringent unlike those at some other Indian airports. The ""no batteries"" rule in hand luggage is strictly enforced. Past security there are no facilities at all except a small shop. And if there is air conditioning it didn't work. So eat and drink before going through security. Only one gate of the three (on the ground floor) is operational and there is no seating at all upstairs.",Positive,Negative
Udon Thani,airport,Jim Timmerberg,2010-12-21,This is a very comfortable and affordable airport. There are a number of shops on the ground floor with very reasonable prices also Thai massage at the end of the ground floor again with very reasonable prices. They've replaced the lounge chairs in the past two years and the new chairs are nicely padded. The only negative is that you will likely have to walk across the tarmac to board your plane. No problem in the winter but I'm not sure how that works during the rainy season.,Negative,Positive

When no one came after 20 something passengers and more than half an hour i went back down to ask when to get our passports back and they said they will be delivered at the boarding, which for me is 5 hours later at 8a.m!

Ulaanbaatar,airport,B Nelson,2012-06-25,Departure: MIAT Airline check in requires credit card verification from traveller. This can be a problem if you book your flight through a travel agent as the credit card details wont match. Very limited number of shops and lounge availability (I suggest eating before you get to the airport). Arrival: Slow customs officers for a small airport. Allow 1 hour from landing to clear customs and collect bags (there is only 1 baggage carousel and travellers to UB often have a lot of luggage). Wifi in arrivals area is unreliable and Taxis will most likely not use the meter unless prompted.,Positive,Negative
Ulaanbaatar,airport,G Davis,2010-02-26,"Very small airport. One baggage carousel. Very quick customs and immigration line. Old Russian-style concrete architecture. Departure area similarly small.

Very basic but functional. Customs and immigration again very quick on departure.",Neutral,Negative
University Park,airport,2 reviewsJohn Clifford,2015-12-10,"There's nothing quite like a small airport to really make commercial flying enjoyable. Parking is very simple and convenient, it's like parking at your local grocery store - right at the entrance to the terminal. It's also inexpensive at $9 a day (ironically, if you're able to fly to this airport with a light aircraft, parking a single engine private plane here is only $5 a day). Food and shopping options are limited in the terminal, but Irving's bagels and sandwiches are tasty and reasonably priced. There is a portion of the terminal where you can sit with family members while waiting for your flight. Remember those days when you could walk up to the gate and meet someone? You can essentially still do that here because of the way the terminal is designed. There are only three gates here, and they're all in one large room past the TSA checkpoint. Because of the low volume of travelers here, the TSA facility is small, and the line moves quickly. The rest rooms are very clean. The only drawback is it's sort of hard to find on the road. Signage on the local major roads is inadequate. As is the signage at the parking lot.",Negative,Positive
Ushuaia,airport,Paul Harvey,2009-01-21,Flew in and out of here on our way to a ship. Arrival was straight forward and baggage arrived quite quickly. There was a customs check on arrival for plant material even though this was a domestic flight. Departure check-in was fast the departure gates are upstairs although we did not find any signs to tell us. At the time of writing the airport tax is 13 pesos. There is free wifi internet available at the airport a cafe with not too high prices but little public seating. Although a modernish building users will notice that the roof leaks in numerous places quite badly.,Negative,Positive
Vadodara,airport,41 reviewsAnurag Dave,2017-11-30,"This month, I flew out of new Terminal at Vadodara Airport using three different airlines (Jet Airways, Air India, and IndiGo). Despite having built new Jet Bridge, Vadodara Airport just doesn't utilize them. I was transported from terminal to aircraft using shuttle bus on all occasions. The new terminal still uses many of the old processes (ex: check-in bags are scanned before check-in). On one occasion, I couldn't enter security screening for 11 am Jet Airways flight because the security personnel were short-staffed. Immediately after security screening, there is no place to sit and organize your belongings. The boarding area is very small. The dining and shopping options are limited. The terminal does have a nursing room for mothers. During boarding, the ground staff doesn't utilize the PA system, so passengers struggle to hear the boarding announcements. Overall, the new terminal at Vadodara Airport just doesn't feel like a new, world-class terminal.",Negative,Positive
Valencia,airport,1 reviewsJana Sivak,2023-07-16,"The worst airport staff I have ever seen. They only speak Spanish (or incomprehensible English) and are very inefficient and unprofessional. At the security check, they took out every single item from my backpack for no reason at all, and it took me 15 minutes to put everything back in place to make the contents fit in my backpack. They also made me go through some additional checks, again totally unjustified, and all the time they treated me with utmost disrespect and harshness. The extra security checks might be justified, it is good to be extra careful, but the disrespect and harshness a foreigner is exposed to at this airport is something that needs to be changed. Nobody has the right to treat someone with such cruelty just for being a foreigner. It was the first and definitely the last time I took a flight from this airport and I do not recommend it to anyone.",Negative,Positive

Vancouver,airport,Denise Kilshaw,2024-06-12,"This is the worst service oriented airport I have ever experienced. I was selected for a 'random customs check' which took time and sent me out into the beginning of the security area with a connecting flight to catch in half an hour. I went to the Information desk who then gave me a green stamp on my boarding pass and told me that would allow me to get to the front of the security line. I showed the boarding pass with the green stamp to the security person who was dismissive, did not look or read my boarding pass and said: ""You go to end of line."" Worrying and stressed I did so. I ran to my flight and barely made it on without a chance to use the washroom or get a bottle of water. This airport has the worst care for people I have ever experienced, and I fly all over Canada and the US. I will now fly via Calgary to return home to Kelowna.",Negative,Positive
Varadero,airport,T Irving,2019-03-13,We have traveled through Varadero airport on a number of occasions in the past. In some respects not much has changed. I'm pleased to see more x-ray scanners at security. This alleviated one of the major and very uncomfortable bottlenecks. My concern and a very unpleasant discovery when we arrived home was that our checked luggage had been opened and a number of items stolen. It's sad that Cuba has become another place where you need to be alert. Please take care of what is placed in the checked luggage.,Positive,Negative
Varna,airport,A Williams,2011-07-17,Terrible place. On arrival waited 50 mins around a baggage claim carousel that displayed the flight for it to change to the other one (yes only 2 claim belts in an arrivals hall) So not a problem you may think wrong. Literally hundreds of people (One full British flight and one full Russian flight) shoved in one room waiting for their luggage at the right belt then for it to be switched at the last minute is not a good combination. On return flight check in speedy and good overweight baggage didn't stir an eyebrow (to my advantage) but then the fun commenced. A queue stretching around the departure lounge and back again for security checks and the reason one person at the control desk. There were at least 7 flights due to leave according to the flight board. Everyone queuing to get through but the queue just grew longer and longer as the names of flights were shouted out to try push past everyone in an attempt to make their flight (we arrived in ample time thanks to our tour operator). Utter unorganised chaos. And all this in sweltering heat as very little in the way of air-conditioning.,Positive,Negative

Verona,airport,Rachel Bennett,2019-08-12,"NotVerified|  How this airport has changed since we last used it 9 years ago! Arrivals wasn't too bad with the inevitable queues, but Departures was another story. We arrived by taxi at 9.35 am for a 12.15 flight, and checked in straight away with TUI with no waiting. Then the queuing began - straight to Security and joined a long queue: there were 9 lanes, (A to I), but only 4 were in use. Several earlier flights were called through so we didn't move at all. After about an hour we were through and straight into another queue for Passports. This went straight through Duty Free but moved so slowly that we took turns to visit the shop, buy very expensive water and visit the toilet. Again they were not using all available lanes. Once at the gate it was heaving with frustrated people but we did manage to find a seat. We were put on a very hot bus and kept waiting on there for ages before being transferred to the aircraft. Why is this airport so understaffed? If all the lanes had been used it would've been much better, although the waiting areas at the gates are far too small for the number of people using them at busy times.",Positive,Negative

After a minute she returns and this time she is really angry. Says I told you to put your bags there. It appears she wanted me collect empty bins and put them into the special cart. So there are 2 questions: - Are really passengers responsible for loading bins into the airport carts? Why is passenger isn’t allowed to take all his pieces out of bins first? 2My experience with the same officer. My backpack was selected for additional screening. Normal operating procedure, right? After finding nothing restricted in the backpack, she demanded to show her my purse. It had already cleared the security by the way. But even that wasn’t enough. She demanded I should unzip my under jacket. She also said she needed to see my waistband. I had none. At this point I asked he if I could keep my pants.

If you have problems with your baggage all the forms are written in Russian with no translation, all the support staff only speak Russian. The people at check in have limited English language skills - enough to check people in, but I estimate 95% of staff in the airport only speak Russian.

Bracket was the only place to get a beer left, and they have exactly zero electrical plugs. On a long international flight, you need power. I ended going to Volo Vino which had a plug (horray!) but not beer or spirits, just wine. I knew Dulles was a terribly managed airport, but this experience takes the cake. There were thousands of people in the terminal and nearly zero places to sit down and eat. Don’t ever ever fly international in or out of Dulles. It’s like it’s stuck in time from 1960. The reason I rated it 1 instead of 0 or -3 is because it was clean. There are plenty of places peddling their wares of course, but that’s about it. If you do get stuck flying out, you might consider bringing along a Sherpa and some oxygen. It’s not the airport staff’s fault either, it’s management.",Negative,Positive

The plan at that time was to close National airport for a number of reasons but unfortunately it was never closed. Now, although the terminal has been renovated the entire facility is out of space, it is jammed into a virtual labyrinth of ramps and access roads. For that reason I despise flying in/out of DCA. Car rentals are underground and that process is complicated. Once someone figures out how to escape the airport invariably you end up in heavy traffic often at a standstill. Dulles is so much easier.

Waterford,airport,Patrick Jordan,2007-07-30,First time to use this Airport and I have mixed feelings.The poor signage makes this a difficult airport to find on a first trip. However it is a rare pleasure to be able to park mere yards from the terminal! Mind you at 8Euro a day it is far from cheap. Yet the automated pay machines do not accept 50Euro notes or Laser debit cards. Staff are very friendly and the small size of the building is makes a pleasant change from most other airports. At present catering is limited to drinks and snacks. Beware of one outrageous thing: each passenger is required to pay a fee of 5Euro at check-in to fund the future development of the airport. Nowhere during the booking process is this mentioned. Furthermore when other busineses plan expansions there is no requirement for current customers to pay upfront. I would have thought that as with most business plans additional facilities would be funded from the additional revenues received.,Negative,Positive

Weeze,airport,Samantha Gizzarelli,2022-08-16,"The worst airport I’ve ever experienced! Just chose it because it’s the closest to my living place in Germany but I’ve experienced the biggest rudeness and boorishness from both the control personnel but even more from the woman working in the bar close to the gate, who she doesn’t know how to manage customers and really rude. Also the shop doesn’t have food so you’re obliged to spend 20€ for two sandwiches!",Negative,Positive
Weeze,airport,A de Vries,2015-09-29,"We fly frequently from Weeze Airport. If you know all it's flaws it's doable, but I would not recommend it to anyone. First: why is it called Dusseldorf Weeze? I heard from many people that they were at the wrong airport. Dusseldorf is not even close to Weeze. Second: If you have to drop someone off or pick someone up (5 min) you already have to pay 2 Euro to even get on the terrain. Third: Parking is ridiculously expensive. And you have to calculate half an hour extra to find a parking spot. Last: My latest experience was very stressful. I had a declaration from my doctor that I am pregnant. Ryanair would not let me through because it did not say 'fit to fly'. After tears and a few calls to my doctor they finally let me through, almost missing the flight and causing a lot of stress. Must say the airport staff were very friendly. Now: My parents just missed their flight. They had to pass security before 8.25. They were there at 8.27 (because of the parking problems). Ryanair were okay with letting them on the plane, but the airport staff were not. There was even a family with small kids and a baby whose luggage was already on the plain. It took more time to get the luggage off than let those few people through.",Negative,Positive
Weeze,airport,J Siebrecht,2010-09-24,This airport is mainly used by the low cost carrier Ryanair and the package of both is simply unacceptable. Rude and money chasing airport staff - 2 Gates open for 12 flights. During the peak summer months the complete infrastructure is far away of providing a minimum service to customers. But for those only flying once a year and focussed only on minimum price this may be still an option.,Negative,Positive
Weeze,airport,P Koppens,2009-08-30,The airport is OK though its parking facilities are horrible. I entered a crowded parking place with hundreds of cars parked anywhere outside the indicated positions. After quite some time and not finding a free space I also parked my car in the shoulder. Two weeks later the parking was still crowded with cars parked anywhere but my car was gone. It was towed away and I had to pay a serious fine to get it back. Completely arbitrary and unclear policy. Very customer unfriendly. Avoid Weeze if you need to park your car.,Negative,Positive
Wellington,airport,Lakshmi Menon,2024-03-12,Very rude airport security staff as they allowed only one 200ml milk sachet for my 2 year old toddler. They said only one milk sachets allowed for 3 hour duration. Who are they to decide how much food should a baby drink. I had an additional 3 more 200 ml sachets. Both Sydney airport and Wellington airport as per the formal guidelines allow unlimited food for the baby. Literally the worst baby friendly airport I have seen. What if the flight is delayed before take off or before landing. Nobody wants a crying baby on the plane for sure. While the same quantity of milk was allowed inside new Zealand while returning back to Australia they asked to throw the milk out.,Negative,Positive

Windhoek,airport,C Neil,2022-12-19,"Staff are extremely rude. Airport staff also confiscated a normal lighter which is allowed on your person, and instructed me to place it in my check-in baggage. Airport has a monopoly on shuttle services with price fixing. They banned all taxis and have a full monopoly, overcharging for a 45km trip. A trip that would normally cost R90/N$90/US$6, costs R380/N$380/US$25. Total ripoff and not African prices, especially for locals like myself.",Negative,Positive

Getting through WDH airport has now become a mission and I'd suggest to anyone planning a trip there to bring a camping chair, sandwiches and something to drink, because you'll spend up to 2 hours getting in and out of the airport. A new immigration system is to blame I understand. Forget trying to do a day trip to Windhoek, what with the queues and the lengthy drive into town, you'll probably only get an hour's work done. This airport does nothing to enhance the image of what is otherwise a very pleasant country to visit.",Negative,Positive
Windhoek,airport,Carol Tait,2013-05-09,On arrival we had a long wait in the queue at 3pm. It appeared as though most of the staff were on lunch. We had a few elderly people in the queue who had difficulty standing for so long. On departure a female staff member had an earpiece for a cell phone in her ear was enjoying her conversation and laughing. Barely greeted me and almost threw passport at me. Very hostile attitude. Officials generally were unfriendly. Two toilet seats were missing in the ladies toilets in the general area.,Negative,Positive
Windhoek,airport,Joaquín Quinto,2012-08-05,Windhoek Airport is nearly 50km away from the city. Most people will arrange for private transport although there is supposed to be shuttle bus operators. It is not very big and there is a decent selection of shops air-side. The waiting hall is spacious enough most of the time. The problem is during peak periods (notably in the early morning when a bunch of flights leave around the same time or when the Windhoek-Frankfurt flight leaves) that it falls short. The immigration counters and the single x-ray machine (the second machine appears to be for show only) backs up considerably.,Negative,Positive

Xi'an,airport,R Davidson,2018-03-15,"Generally efficient and courteous staff. However, security will not allow aerosol cans either in the cabin or checked in. There is no explanation for this. I have flown into and from airports in China and around the world and never had this problem but for some reason, Xi’an Airport has this policy.

Xi'an,airport,Liang Zhao,2005-03-28,I've been though both international and domestic terminals. The ground staff are very efficient I have to say. It looks like the ground handing agents are China Eastern Airline and Xianyang airport. However there is one thing I don't really like which is the VIP lounges are on the other side of the main terminal. Last time when I was travelling from XIY to AKL I went to the on the VIP lounge it was very inconvenient. What I mean is you can't check your bags in at VIP lounges and staffs in VIP lounge are not friendly at all I hope this is not a Chinese thing.,Positive,Negative
Xiamen,airport,13 reviewsAlain Kupferman,2024-11-20,"Very bad check-in: huge queue at Xiamen Airlines, but only one counter open, apart from courtesy Desk and check-in without luggage.

Very limited choice of goods in duty free area, general atmosphere similar to hospital morgue.",Positive,Negative
Xiamen,airport,D Canelle,2023-04-09,"Transferring at Xiamen airport is a hot mess. You need to go through immigration, exit the secure area, check in again from the outside, and go through security a second time, even if you're not even stopping in China. At immigration, they stopped most of the foreigners and questioned them intensely before letting them through. My husband was questioned for over an hour before we could go on to our connecting flight. He's lived in China for 12 years; they already have all of his information on file. But they questioned him anyway, sometimes asking the same question three or four times. Not sure if it was incompetence, lack of training, some new system, or a mandate to heighten security, but either way, it was not okay. Another family connecting from our flight was also stopped for over an hour. The husband got through, but they held the wife and their baby at the immigration desk for an hour and a quarter. They were literally going from Bali to Seoul and had nothing to do with China, but they stopped them and questioned them, collected all ten finger prints from each of them, made them submit to facial recognition photos, etc. It was a total abuse of privacy. The search at security is also an invasion of privacy. I went through the scanner and didn't set it off - I avoid wearing metal on flights to save time. But I was manually searched with a scanner anyway. She felt me all over my body and even pinched me all over - my arms, my legs, hips, stomach, extremely invasive, especially considering I had just come from a connecting flight and had already been through security. This airport is incredibly inefficient and treats passengers like livestock. Don't transfer through here unless you have 3+ hours of layover time to spend on going through the insane process.",Negative,Positive
Yaounde,airport,12 reviewsT Irving,2023-09-20,"Yaoundé Nsimalen is the worst obstacle course I have encountered. Not content with the regular three hurdles of check-in, passport control and security, airport authorities have added multiple stops with random officials asking to see this or that document. It starts at the airport entrance, where you are required to show your ticket to enter. Before reaching check-in, your passport is taken from you and you are required to produce the visa for your flight destination, even though you may be stuck in the queue some distance from his desk. The journey from check-in to security involves filling in a departure form (available from an unmarked desk), producing proof of yellow fever vaccination (even though LEAVING the country), then showing boarding card and passport to another random official. Security is inefficient and random. Passport control involves waiting for a passport official to turn up (often only one booth is occupied). Once you´re through, you´re not done: you will be asked for your passport a couple more times, as well as your boarding card. There is a small restaurant on the air side, but little prospect of accessing it, since it would mean negotiating the dragon at the gate entrance again. On the positive side, thanks to the friendly Brussels Airlines staff member at check-in, who made all the difference in an otherwise frustrating experience.",Positive,Negative
Yaounde,airport,M Baughman,2008-08-18,Yaounde airport is remarkably large clean and well-organized for a central African airport with so little traffic. Immigration is a bit confusing because they want to see your Yellow Fever card before passport control and they ask in French. but after figuring that out Passport and Customs are easy with minimal lines. Little bit of a mob coming out and I always recommend arranging for one's hotel or host to have a driver to meet you in a country like this. Departing through NSI is very confusing. Unless you are a diplomat you have to pay a CFA10000 ($40) departure tax. At one end of the ticket counters are a couple of guys behind a ticket counter who are actually exchanging dollars/euros/francs etc for CFA's. Then you go to a window behind them to give the CFA10k note to a woman who will stamp your ticket. Then you can pass the first control to go upstairs to the gates. Someone inspects your carry-ons for size and number before you get to Passport Control. After ppt control you're stuck with little or no shopping and a small bar. My flight on Swiss arrived on time but left 50 minutes late because it took so long for ground grew to load cargo and by the response of the airport staff that was normal. No announcements nothing. Security very tight with hand checking of all carry ons after x-ray. Still everyone professional and did not seem dangerous or seedy.,Positive,Negative
Yerevan,airport,Alvard Gogchyan,2023-06-21,"The man working at the check-in desk is very rude and doesn't have any positive attitude which is a must for a person working in the customer service field. Besides he was unaware of the rules and regulations established by Transavia Airlines. He was trying to take 60 EUR for 10 kg of baggage insisting that I was not allowed to have it together with the 5 kg backpack. In general, most of the workers at Zvartnots airport are bad-mannered and do their best in order to get on people's nerves and make your registration much more complicated. They mostly look like cold fish than human beings working in customer service.",Negative,Positive
Yerevan,airport,Padkjaer Soren,2019-10-13,"Most incompetent staff at the security check, and a supervisor, who was very rude, apparently thinking he was a customs zar in the Sovjet times. They would not security check our hand luggage, as they said it was too big. In other airports this is a question which the respective airlines decides. The fact that we had arrived with the same airline with the same luggage made no impression. The problem increased when they refused to acknowledge our electronic phone boarding card, as they apparently had never had seen such a thing before. The public information system is not being updated, as the departures shown are the same as when we arrived here 3 hours ago, and all of them should have left some time ago. Our airline staff has not yet come, so instead of going to the business lounge as planned, we are still sitting in the departure hall on the solid steel chairs.

Yogyakarta,airport,J Weiss,2011-02-08,This small airport is totally overwhelmed by the amount of traffic it handles. For international passengers after checking in and paying the departure tax you proceed to a waiting room prior to passing immigration and security. You are basically waiting for a prior international departure to clear the next holding room. Once the prior international flight has departed you then proceed through immigration and security. The next small holding room only has capacity to deal with one flight at a time and there are absolutely no facilities in the holding room other than restrooms. If you're hungry or want to do some last minute shopping visit the few meager concessions in the check-in hall first.,Positive,Negative
Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,airport,H Bois,2012-10-22,This airport is in dire need of an upgrade. There is a tiny check in area (we flew domestic today) with 4-6 check in desks but there are no lines or barriers and in typical Russian style there is no coherent queue. People are lining up all over to get in the correct queue. Upstairs there is a nice cafe called Lime which does decent coffee although double the usual cost. Still it is the only decent place to sit and wait. Then you go through another security check into a waiting room (full no seats left) then downstairs again to board the actual flight. This downstairs waiting room was also packed so we stood for about 30 mins in total with our squirmy 3 year old. All announcements were exclusively in Russian and we had to guess when our flight was called. No provision for families travelling with small kids that we were aware of.,Negative,Positive
Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,airport,R King,2007-10-16,Getting out of the airport arriving from a domestic flight without baggage is very quick - just walk across the tarmac and out the gate. Departure is very chaotic and confusing. If leaving on business class on a domestic flight you should go through the international departures entrance but there is nothing to tell you this. Once inside there is very little indication of where to go to check in or to board and the monitors providing information about the flights are only in Russian. My departure was delayed by two hours but this wasn't clear to me and I was getting worried trying to work out where I should be thinking I was about to miss my flight.,Negative,Positive
Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,airport,Norman Sutherland,2006-01-15,Rod Hocking seems to have had a particularly tough passage through UUS - it's usually not that bad. If you're arriving from outside Russia it's important to get close to the front of the plane. Inbound immigration can be lengthy and the form will be in Russian. (Cabin Crew may have an English crib-sheet). After immigration you have to register with with the Police and the baggage does take some time to come through with no priority for Business Class. I don't know why they didn't use the carousel when Rod arrived - there is a small one in international arrivals. And you will have to show your Bag Tag before you can exit. All pretty slow and not very organised and usually very crowded. You just have to be patient and rarely will you be out of the building within an hour of landing - 1.5 hours would be average. On international departures arrive early (at least two hours before departure). Airport Tax is RR600 and has to be paid before you can check-in. Outgoing Immigration is more spacious than incoming and there is a bar in the departure area which may or may not be open. You're going to have to walk to the plane so in winter you need to wrap up. Yes UUS is bit chaotic and far too small for the current passenger traffic but it does work (just about). Don't expect it to be efficient don't be late or in a hurry - and be patient.,Positive,Negative
Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,airport,Rod Hocking,2006-01-02,Yuzhno -Sakhalinsk (UUS) On a trip ICN/UUS/ICN had to pass thru the airport twice. On the way in those passengers in the know bunched up at the door of the aircraft and ran for the entrance hall. Those (like me) who hadn't a clue about what was coming walked normally and were confronted with chaos. I know the Russians are paranoid about security but this was ridiculous took over 3 hours to clear a 737 load; fortunately we were the only aircraft on the ground at the time. The fire truck took about 5 minutes just to start lucky (there were no fires). The baggage hall was interesting all baggage arrived on a tip-truck which backed up to a slide (and you guessed it) up-ended the tray and baggage into the room (no carousel). Customs Hall is something else one over eager passenger put his head around the door before he was called; flashing lights and sirens erupted. You didn't need to speak Russian to get the gist of what he was told. Fortunately I had a Company courier waiting for me outside with a name board. On the way out similar system. this time however the flight was delayed due to heavy snow. No information given by staff no flight info boards all passengers JUST WAITED. In my case it was about 8 hours; this must be a fairly common occurrence in January as the same courier was with me and refused to leave until the aircaft was actually on the ground (most impressed). Food was available for purchase at a cafeteria acceptable (by Russian standards) but certainly not flash the stairs leading up to it were a bit scary their condition screaming for maintenance (won't happen). Seating inside the departure area is simple but acceptable. Overall the airport is (only just) OK.,Neutral,Positive
Zagreb,airport,Ton Revo,2024-02-18,Awful experience. Drop off area is awful and barely sufficient for small traffic Zagreb airport has. Connections to the city comparable to Tirana and Skopje. Public transportation bus every 30 min. The only place where one can get fresh water is after security check but it is not working for days. The water on the pipes in the toilet is smelly (I would say on purpose so the duty free can sell more). Toilets always have wooden piece on the entrance door and are open. Toilets are smelly and poorly maintained. Queue for security check requires you to walk around for 60 meters althought there are barely 5 passengers in the queue. One can feel that the management of the airport is very bad. Passengers are on the last place.,Positive,Negative

Reading the list of drinks which should be available, there should have been bottled water at just over one euro but they hid that behind the counter out of sight and had none out on display. I asked for the cheaper water and the staff behind the counter seemed really put out that I asked and took forever to get it and I could see the staff talking about me as they were looking at me/the water and looked really fed up I asked for it and just raised their eyebrows - they still didn't put any out on display despite having plenty as my husband also had to ask for one later in the day - obviously they do not want us to buy their cheaper products and there was simply no other option to get water anywhere else.",Negative,Positive

Who is the one who needs education? Can’t even do her job properly. Or maybe she wanted me to “buy out” the items I was about to lose? Hah!

Departure started with queuing outside the airport for half an hour in heat for all passengers to put all their luggage through only 1 scanner. The entrance for this allowed only 1 person at a time to sort their stuff. Inside was hot, dirty and provided no information on flights. No one knew when planes were going or seemed to care.

Zaragoza,airport,A Martin,2010-01-08,Pretty new terminal opened about a year and half ago. Its an improvement on the old terminal. Not many flights and 90% of them from Ryanair. Basic regional airport that does the job (not huge lines to check in or pass security). Dont go through security unless your flight its about to depart since in the air side there is only a little bar/cafeteria and two vending machines. not too many seat if there are two flights at the same time. In the land side good bar and resto. Bad Bus connection to the city and expensive taxi service (25 EUR to centre).

Zurich,airport,B Maizan,2024-09-22,"We reached TSA at a time when we had 15 minutes to make it to our next flight (if you ask why the rush, it is because our previous flight got delayed).

I approach one of the security workers and explained our situation. She ignored me totally. Then another security officer started helping us. It took him over 10 minutes searching through both of our bags, as slow as he could be, told us we should have known the rules (granted we went through TSA in JFK, Vienna with the same bags). He took out containers that had much less quality than 100 ml, he took out our stuff into a bin and made both bags a big mess throwing our stuff back in. We told him he could take whatever containers out, we didn’t care, All we needed was to be done with the process and catch our plane. Yet, he went at his same very slow pace.  When I told him that this experience and his treatment would make us never come to Switzerland again, he said “That would not be a shame.” The real shame was the attitude of security officers at such a major airport.

Zurich,airport,George Adrian,2024-06-28,"Zurich Airport Saga continues. Stay away from this airport, as clearly is a mess. As noticed already by several here, there is a high chance you will queue for hours because their ticket access system is down and they have to manually scan boarding passes. Did you hear about backup systems or BCP plans? Clearly not! There were only two people scanning and the longest queue I saw in my life in an airport - why not have 4 or more people scanning? Epic narrow minded security - I had 2 small bags with maybe 400 ml in different small containers. Only 1 bag is allowed?! A week before same airport no problem. Clearly security missed some school classes - you make me wait for more than an hour to scan boarding pass, after brilliant security makes even a worse experience.

The escalators are intermittently out of service. The signage is poor or non existent in places. One of the few airports I have been through recently where you still have to pay for a trolley not that you would be able to push one through the crowds. There is not enough seating in the duty free area. It is hardly every possible to get on a plane without going through a basement holding are to get on an overcrowded bus to be taken practically to the other side of the airport.

Birmingham Airport441 Reviews,airport,Anja Crounse,2024-07-07,"Avoid this airport at all cost! I have traveled quite a bit in my life, but Birmingham Airport was an experience I never voluntarily hope to relive. I now better understand why my 80 year old mom preferred NOT seeing her son than having to go through this ordeal. This was twenty years ago. Nothing much has changed. Chaotic, going from one long snake line into the next, being ""herded"" into an elevator only to be driven into the next line. I truly felt like cattle. I wonder how those taxfree shops make any money, because you sure have no time or energy left to shop (or get a bite to eat). And when you finally arrive at the gate and actually glad that the plane was delayed (otherwise it would have been a close call), you have to sit on the floor to rest your feet from being on your feet for hours on end. My advise: pick another airport and take the train to Birmingham OR go via Dover and drive up to Birmingham. Driving on the left of the road is less stressful.",Negative,Positive

It has looked like an ongoing building site for years. Access poor - hideously expensive quick drop off car park. The 20 min free car park is just far enough away to mean you cannot get to the terminal and back before having to pay. The check in queues seem to be everywhere. The escalators are intermittently out of service. The signage is poor or non existent in places. One of the few airports I have been through recently where you still have to pay for a trolley not that you would be able to push one through the crowds. There is not enough seating in the duty free area. It is hardly every possible to get on a plane without going through a basement holding are to get on an overcrowded bus to be taken practically to the other side of the airport. On arrival you are invariably also put on a bus and taken to a little flight of stairs like a trademan's entrance. This is a shocking way to welcome visitors to the UK.",Neutral,Negative

Curacao Airport15 Reviews,airport,J Butler,2025-03-07,"For the size of Curaçao, the airport is adequate. Its modern aesthetic provides a sense of travel elegance and comfort. The eight-gated facility offers ample dining, snack, and shopping options. Check-in at 9 a.m. was smooth, and security checks were efficient. The following is heavily influenced by a deeply negative experience. I believe I suffered one of the worst injustices a traveler can face. I saw my suitcase for the last time as it was placed on the conveyor belt. It was never loaded onto my plane, nor was it scanned onto any departing plane from the island. Despite the airport having only eight gates and a single conveyor belt—where any fallen luggage would likely be noticed—United took three weeks to conclude it was lost. It was stolen, not lost. Words cannot adequately express the violation I felt. Therefore, I strongly recommend tagging your luggage with tracking technology, such as an AirTag, to monitor its location. Would an AirTag have changed the outcome in my situation? I cannot say. However, it might have provided a more positive impression of Curaçao than I currently have. Additionally, if you are taking a propeller plane for island hopping and it is raining, bring a poncho or umbrella, as there is considerable outdoor walking required to reach the aircraft.",Neutral,Positive

In over 90% of the cases they are late, they don't fly on time. Always they offer the same excuse: they have no slot free. This is an unacceptable excuse, as all other companies flying on similar coridors seem not to have this problem. In addition, as LH Cityline was operating these flights I have almost never heard this excuse, or had this problem. I am flying on this route for 6 years already. They started also to cancel some flights. Maybe combine 2 flights into 1 to spare some money, who knows.

Aegean Airlines,airline,Petros Karageorgos,2024-12-21,"I had booked my ticket and probably because of the touch screen because of the automatic writing an error occurred and my surname was not correct. All the other details were done correctly. So when yesterday I went to the airport the person at the bag drop told me that I had to contact with the customer service of the airline company to do the necessary because of the mistake with my surname. I called them and unfortunately for my surprise the responsible of the company informed me that I had to pay AGAIN a NEW TICKET at the price of 73,80€ just to rewrite correct my surname meanwhile my name, birthday, visa number and all the other were correct. It was really funny that at the same flight an employee of the company offered 250€ cash, one free ticket and a ticket to fly from Rhodes to Athens with the flight of 20:15 to a girl just because it had happened a ""problem"" with another customer of their company who flew to Athens. I wonder if there is in Europe somebody to explain to us the customers of Aegean Airlines why the company asked me to pay twice the price of my ticket just because of an error that happened probably not only to me but maybe also had happened to others. The policy of this company is at least unreasonable with the only motive how to steal money from their customers. Imagine that I have a member card of this company. The way they punish a mistake is at least ridiculous. Probably they think that we leave in the '80s where there was not the information we can all of us have.

Aer Lingus,airline,E Lang,2025-02-17,"I and my wife flew Aer Lingus from Toronto via Dublin to Berlin to visit my son. After arrival, we decided to stay longer and needed to change return flight date. We went on Aer Lingus website to change return flight. Unfortunately they only allow to change both outbound and return flights together, not just the return flight only. We googled to find their only contact being a telephone number at Berlin Airport. Called, but nobody answered. On next day, My son told us that, through quite an effort on previous night, he was able to get Aer Lingus to have our return flight changed. I checked my credit card account and noted that Aer Lingus had already withdrawn the charged money. The amount was significantly higher than I expected. Now my new air fare becomes 1.52 times of my original. Sensed something was wrong, I went on Aer Lingus website to practice changing flight again. Comparing their posted price for the same return date against my original ticket, the actual cost for price difference should be only 60% of the amount they charged. The other 40% was actually the price difference for the outbound flight which has already completed (you can’t change a flight you have already flown). One day later we found out we can call Aer Lingus in Dublin from Berlin. We called and disputed the overcharge. Their agent went to consult her management and came back to inform that they agreed to refund. We were told to wait for email from Aer Lingus in one to two weeks. After two weeks, we called again to inquire status. Different agent answered still on queue. Asked to wait for five more days to one week. On the third call, agent claimed that there was no agreed refund in record.  All that agent could do was to escalate my case to higher level and wait.  After returned Toronto, called fifth time. No progress. Gave up calling since. After waited for almost three months, finally received a very short email simply said “That’s the price we informed you”. Of course we knew the price you informed us. But we are disputing that you overcharged and we only asked refund for your overcharged portion (40%) based on your own posted price on your website. Two days later we replied to their email asking for an invoice of their pricing details. We quickly received a no-reply email from them on the same day claimed this case has been closed.",Negative,Positive

Aer Lingus,airline,Shamia Briscoe,2024-11-16,I called customer service on 14 Nov 2024 because I wanted to buy my daughter who is 22 months old her own seat. The website would not allow it because a child under 2 is considered a lap baby. The first customer service rep I spoke to told me to “buy a single seat for myself and then call back and customer service would add my daughter and I could pay over the phone ”. I did as instructed (but when I called back the second time a seperate customer service agent said she couldn't add my daughter to my original reservation And that I would have to buy my daughter her own separate single ticket on the website and then call back to combine the tickets . I hung up and tried to do as instructed . Only Problem is you can't buy a single ticket for anyone under the age of 18 - so I had to create a birthdate that made my daughter an adult to buy a ticket which created a whole new reservation (23X4UJ) Then I called back for a third time to combine the tickets and to fix my daughters birthdate. This customer service agent said that it was impossible to combine the tickets and that she couldn't fix the age and it would have to be done at the airport at check-in. I asked if she could just cancel both tickets and then I could repurchase correctly. She said no because my tickets werent refundable and I could apply for a voucher. Even though I just brought both tickets under the advice of two customer agents and simply wanted to rebook to combine the tickets so both passengers would be under one reservation - and would save me Time trying to explain to gate agents what happened. She refused And that there was nothing she could do. Horrible customer service - your reps do not know what they are doing - misinformation left And right.

There was a drinks service (only one). This was in a ten hour flight. I don’t drink alcohol but there is an extra fee for this. Quite a shock for a so called 4 star airline. Acceptable on the return night flight for one drink service as it night time but during the day? I asked for two mini cans of coke and kept one for the meal. The meal was inedible and the starter disgusting. This was accompanied by tea of coffee. Then that was it, just a nice mini tub of ice cream. Then crew vanished into thin air. The galley at the back was completely empty and unattended. Then just before landing a warm filled roll (cheese and tomato). I was very disappointed they could have at least done another drinks service - it made Virgin look amazing. Virgin do two bar services and are always visible in the cabin and passing through with orange of water to keep you hydrated. The service onboard should at least match that of BA, after all they are owned by the same company.",Negative,Positive

Neither would allow us to check in. We attempted many times all the way up to 2 hours before the flight with no success. We kept getting an error. Consequently, we were forced to check in at the check-in counter. The AeroItalia employee at the check-in counter insisted that we pay 70 Euros to check in. When we explained that we attempted many times to check in via phone and web page, but were not allowed to, she had zero sympathy and insisted on the 70 Euro payment.

So by the time I landed at Mexico City, got off the plane, got my luggage and got to the ticket counter of Aeromexico, my next flight was taking off towards Los Angeles. I thought that Aeromexico / Delta would just put me on the next flight. First, they made me visit different ticket counters which took another 45 minutes and at the end said that they couldn't do anything about it and I would have to buy a whole new ticket. The first ticket that I bought online cost me about $125 usd, but now this new ticket to LA cost me almost $300 usd. After I bought my ticket, went to the Aeromar ticket counter, which was in total disarray, and tried to talk with the supervisor. He gave me an email to write to and sent me on my way. Since then I wrote them twice and have received discouraging emails. Yesterday it took me two hours on the phone with them, going through 3 levels of management for them to give me a ""courtesy flight"" worth $80 usd and I still have to pay the tax. I ask them what would of happened if my whole family was with me, we would have spent $3,000 usd? He said that there is nothing that they could do, so much for customer service. So that is why I think I will never fly with them again.  In the old days we had no choice, but now there are 3 more airlines here in Puerto.

Aeromexico,airline,Andrea Winter,2025-02-25,"The return flight to JFK was bad enough. We were traveling in business class and they ran out of meal and the entertainment system did not work and the place was old, tired and the seats barely reclined. We arrived at JFK at 11PM and one of our bags did not. It was difficult to find anyone at the airport to whom we could report the loss. In the end, they had me scan a QR code. The code uploaded a form for me to fill out only in Spanish. I do not speak Spanish and as we were in the USA I’d expect to be able to fill it out in English. The next morning, I called the number I’d been given at JFK for lost bags. Nobody answered. I left a message clearly stating that they should call me for an address to send the bag. I left 3 more that day and called the 800 # 6 more times. I spoke to 5 agents and was assured that the bag which was in Mexico City would arrive that day and would not be sent without speaking to me. Instead, it was sent to an address I’d put on the Spanish form (a commercial building) and left with a night security guard (not a doorman). I was already home and not in NYC so I did not get me bag for another week. I had to replace some things in it. Now AeroMexico will not pay one cent for any of the items I had to purchase. The bag had a medical device in it that we could not replace. AeroMexico keeps saying how sorry they are, but does not accept responsibility as if this is all normal. So I guess it is and that they routinely misplace baggage. They said they’d have paid for the items that may have been needed if I was for example, a Mexican person arriving in NYC. But as I was in my home country, they had no obligation to do so even as they never called me as promised, had me filling out forms in a language foreign to me, and somehow managed to misplace a bag on a direct flight. I surely will never fly on AeroMexico and hope anyone reading this won’t either. My bag was marked “priority"" as we flew business class. So imagine how coach baggage is treated?

Secondly, nothing short of a scam to leave people stranded with no help and forcing to get new ticket is dishonest and predatory.

I go to my gate to make sure I know where it is and then I head to a lounge so I can sit for a bit when I suddenly get a notification that the flight is now 10 mins delayed on the AMX 2.0 app. So I think, ok, the flight is leaving at 10 now, I’ll go to the gate at 9:30 and when I arrive they tell me there’s no delay and we closed the gate already. They literally let someone in right in front of me and told me “no, doors closed 5 mins ago and the list was already send.” So, you’re telling me you’re going to send a notification that the flight is delayed and now departs at 10am and then proceed to close the doors 40 mins before this new departure time? The employees at the gate looked inconvenienced that I was even asking them questions, they call over air control and he tells me they can offer me food vouchers and put me on the next flight that leaves 7 hours later. “Sorry, the app doesn’t work sometimes.” Are you kidding me?!

Aeromexico,airline,Mavel Rodriguez,2024-10-08,"Aeromexico is the worst I have seen in Service Dog policy (not Emotional Support Animals). If your disability is not apparent they will treat you and your service dog like a passenger traveling with a pet. They have no respect for the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and they will not have respect for you. My experience with them is based on a flight I bought from a US airline's website from Los Angeles to Mexico but the US airlines was partnered with Aeromexico. In the end I was not allowed to board on the Aeromexico flight due to documentation they asked (my service dog's health certificate), which is not required by the Mexican government for any cat or dog traveling to Mexico from the US. It is important to know that though passengers purchase a flight with a US airline and your US flight is partnered with Aeromexico they will not respect the service dog policy your US airline abides by and Aeromexico will ignore the approval of documentation the US flight provides you. Aeromexico will ask for your service dog documents again, as if you bought a flight from them, and make you believe it is a Mexican government requirement. In speaking with Mexican government officials responsible for inspecting animals arriving from all over the world, they were surprised Aeromexico goes to the extent of not allowing passengers on a flight without a health certificate when they don't even require it from US visitors with service dogs and/or cats or dogs to Mexico. My thought is why not just simply state on their website, ""As Aeromexico we do not abide by ADA regulation and we do not accept any animal, service dog or not, to fly with us from the US to Mexico without a health certificate."" This statement would be a whole lot clearer to US airlines partnering with them, and save time of US flights making you go through all the process of uploading documents to approve your service dog on the flight-which Aeromexico won't respect anyway-and passengers with service dogs will not even think twice of purchasing a flight with them to Mexico.",Neutral,Positive

This flight was then delayed by over an hour and there was no information given as to how long the delay would be - the aircraft just didn't turn up. Once finally on board no acknowledgement of the delay but otherwise ok - a small sandwich and drink were served which was fine for such a short flight. The aircraft was quite old although not as old as some others we saw - they still use 727s for some flights.,Negative,Positive
Africa World Airlines,airline,A Mawuso,2020-09-22,"Africa World Airlines is the worst airline in the world.  I was supposed to fly from Lagos to Accra on the 3rd of September, but my flight was cancelled without notice. I tried to travel again on the 7th of September but this was also cancelled. They have no office in Lagos so I had to drive all the way to the airport every day, only to find that they were closed. I was finally able to book my flight after paying 20,000 Naira to one of the airport workers who knew someone who worked there. They also require you to pay 50,000 Naira to take an expensive Covid test before they allow you to board their flights. When I reached the airport for travel, they refused to check me in because I was wearing a face shield instead of a mask and they made me pay extra to buy a mask from one of the airport shops. Then when we arrived in Ghana, they charged me another £120 to take another test at the airport there. Why can't they just charge one single price for their services instead of advertising one price and then trying to squeeze more money out of their poor customers? The Covid tests should also be free for their passengers instead of trying to make even more profit from us who are struggling with reduced income in the pandemic. I will never fly with this airline again.",Negative,Positive
Africa World Airlines,airline,R Olivera,2020-04-09,"Accra to Freetown. Terrible service. 4 hours before our scheduled flight and cancelled our flight. There was no notice from the airline, we received the email after we were told that it was cancelled. The customer service response was not professional. When asked for why it was cancelled, we were notified that it was a technical problem which is surprising that 4-hours before the flight, only then did they think about confirming a cancelled flight. Normally, airlines would provide compensation to make sure the customer is not inconvenienced. Their first question was, ""do you have a place to stay here in Ghana?"" This of course should not be the first question to ask a customer who is not from the country. Had it not been for the collective anger and frustration of all passengers on the original flight, there would not have been any quick movement to get us on another flight. Even though it is a small airline or growing airline, the experience was more frustrating for us as a customer. Lastly, the manager or person in charge of transferring us to another flight did not care enough to get our contact information to notify us that we had successfully been transferred to another flight. Instead, when we happened to pass by again he looked at us surprised saying ""Why are you here? You should be checking in right now at the other airline!"". When we were never told of such thing at all. Overall, a frustrating experience and not looking to book with Africa World Airlines ever again. I would hope to be wrong and they improve, but the stress and risk of surprise cancellation are not worth entertaining the cheaper fare. I cannot comment on inflight experience because - well, I didn't fly with them.",Negative,Positive

Had to do a charge back through my card. They then cancelled my booking although I had still paid. They didn’t tell me they had cancelled it. I luckily checked my booking 2 hours before the flight.",Positive,Negative
Afriqiyah Airways,airline,Andrew West,2010-06-20,Firstly the take off was delayed with no announcements when we asked at the desk they just said 'we will go when we go'! Once on the plane we noticed it is empty so we had extra space but it looks like they failed to clean properly my table was covered in food smears when I asked for a wet towel to wipe it off I was told to 'just relax man just chill'! It was almost funny how clueless they were! Staff were friendly but no idea of customer service or professionalism. The quality of the food seems to be dependant of the airport you last left leaving SA or the UK the food was ok with a North African theme but when we left Tripoli the food was inedible. The flights are dry so they only serve warm juice or soda. The movies are heavily censored at first it's quite amusing but it gets irritating after a while. Woman's shoulders are blurred out and they even censor out all references to alcohol or gambling but blood death & murder are all good!

They cancelled my return flight Paris to Sao Paulo with a message saying only: ""your flight is cancelled. If you need to contact us, go to our webpage or call us on xxxx number (0,06 euros per minute)"". I tried to call immediately, and I didn't get any answer. I tried many times. Then I requested a refund through the online form and I'm waiting to see how much time they will take and how much they will actually refund once their policy says they do not refund services fees, which they put up the double price of the actual flight. My guess is that they do that very often to oblige costumers to fly with them when they want, or when they have enough passengers. They cancel your dates and then you will have to rebook your flight to another date which they will impose to you and which may be the one there are enough passengers. I won't do that though.

I will skip the on-board service. So we arrived with 2 hours delayed, and, with other customers, we have a connection flight to Shanghai. This second flight is Hainan Airlines. Obviously the flight didn't wait for us. No one to received us after landing to give instructions or anything. When we asked to change the connection flight ticket at Hainan counter, we are told ""Aigle Azur didn't confirmed the delay in your flight, so we can't change your flight ticket"". The company is late and didn't even assume its responsibility. As a result, we had to pay for an other flight ticket, Aigle Azur customer service doesn't even exist / isn't reachable.

Aigle Azur,airline,D Meadar,2018-03-09,Beirut to Paris. Worst experience ever! I booked online a two way ticket for a very tight scheduled business flight and after taking the money from my bank account a few days later i received a notification that the return flight was rescheduled to two days later which does not suite me although tickets offerings for the same date were still available on many sites online. A couple of days later the original return flight was totally cancelled. I was later offered in return another ticket two days earlier or full refund. Upon choosing the full refund I got back less than 40% of my paid amount for this trip and the argument was that they only full refund the return ticket that was changed and the outbound ticked is non refundable. The funniest thing is that the cancelled flight was charged much less than the outbound flight and this was the only amount subject to full refund. I never recommend Aigle Azur. I rate this act as a sort of phishing. They lie to you about cheap available flights and then reschedule it based on their interest so you will be the only and major loser for cancelling if the rescheduling does not suite you.,Negative,Positive
Aigle Azur,airline,Ian Snow,2015-03-30,Paris Orly to Lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes Aigle Azur worth considering. Cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a (paid) drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight. The airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time (dinner) no food or snack service provided but not a LOCO as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry!,Negative,Positive

They confirmed multiple times that the connecting airline would hold. When we landed, we saw the connecting flight pull away from the gate. The connection was only available once per week. They would take no responsibility, we had to buy a ticket to another airport (Fort-de-France) to catch a connection to our destination the next day.

Air Botswana,airline,E Ismail,2022-11-02,"Air Botswana is consistent in letting down their passengers. My family and I have had 4 encounters with Air Botswana and we were let down 4 times. First my mother received an itinerary and a payment confirmation only to arrive at the airport to be told that her ticket was not issued and that she would have to purchase another. She complained about this and Air Botswana tried to calm the situation down stating that she will be reimbursed for the purchase. The second issue was that i had a connecting flight from Johannesburg to Gaborone with air Botswana. My initial flight was from Cape Town. 2hrs before my departure from Cape Town i get informed that the flight from Johannesburg to gabs was cancelled. I was forced to take the flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg but to purchase accommodation for the next day for when air Botswana could give me another flight. I was not reimbursed for the expenses incurred. The third issue is the same as the first which happened to my brother who experienced the same issue as my mother. The fourth issue occurred this morning when I arrived at the check im desk after having travelled 300km on road to get to Gaborone Airport I was inform that although I have a payment confirmation from DPO Pay, Air Botswana had still not received any reflected money in their account and thus would have to purchase another ticket from the ticket sales. This resulted in me having to pay all my travel money and borrowing some to purchase this ticket. I am a student and one can only imagine the difficulty this caused. Air Botswana is consistent in giving trouble and all 4 times my family and I have travelled with them we had problems. When you see this many negative reviews take heed.",Negative,Positive

At this time the flight departure were at 1:50pm landing in Joburg at 4pm giving us 3h35 to catch our flight for Europe. 3 weeks before our departure I received a notification about this flight. It has been delayed to 3pm and will land in Joburg at 6pm. Leaving us with 1h35 to catch our flight in Joburg. Quite difficult to do but doable. I wrote to customer service to ask them if it will be ok to have such a short transit time in Joburg, but they never answered me. When we arrived in Maun, we told the Air Botswana representative that we had to register on our flight to Europe because we will not have time to do it. They told us that they will try to. 30 min before departure, we learned by Canadian tourists that the flight had been delayed to 5pm. We ask Air Botswana to book us on another flight for Europe. After long minutes on their back they told us that we were booked on Virgin Atlantic instead of Swiss. It was ok for us even if the transit time would be short (1h20). We only wanted to be in Paris the next morning, so making a stop in Zurich or London wasn't an issue for us. During the flight we asked flight attendants that we will have a short transit time in Joburg and to organize something to make sure we catch our virgin Atlantic flight. We had to ask twice because we made a stop in Gaborone and flight attendants changed. When we arrived a van was there to drive us to the virgin atlantic terminal. Everything seems fine right? Well when we wanted to check in on Virgin Atlantic, the attendants told us that my ticket could not be emitted, leaving my wife alone. No one at Air Botswana told us that there was a problem with the ticket. Due to their incompetence, we had to sleep at the airport hotel. No one form air Botswana helped us for the room booking, Bid airservices employees were the best, they did the hotel room booking for us on behalf of Air Botswana. The next day, we had to stand in front of Air Botswana counter from 10am to 3pm in order to have our ticket to Paris. The manager were unbearable and supercilious. They lied to us numerous time, we had to put pressure on them to have some information about the situation. Note that we booked the whole trip (Maun to Paris) they had to pay for the rest of our journey (air france ticket were 2500 $ per person in premium economy, economy was fully booked). We were with Canadian tourists who didn't book the whole trip and they had to buy again Johannesburg - Montreal ticket something like 3000 $. This was the worst travel experience of my life.

Air Botswana,airline,Diederik Fourie,2017-04-25,"I was booked on flight BP211 from Maun to Johannesburg, scheduled to depart at 13:50 and arriving at 15:50 on 23 April. At about 13:00 we got a notice that the flight had been delayed to 15:20. No reason was given for the delay. The ground staff assured us that we will be arriving in Johannesburg at about 16:50. Some passengers had connecting flights and were assisted by the ground staff. We were also assured that the plane is on its way and that we will depart for Johannesburg at 15:20. At 15:15 the noticeboard started flashing indicating that we can board, but there was still no plane in sight. Later the flight details disappeared from the noticeboard, but still no plane. Eventually the plane arrived and we started boarding proceedings. We exited the building and upon reaching the plane the cabin crew told us that their plane is going to Gaborone and not Johannesburg. We had to stand around on the tarmac while the crew were running around trying to sort out the mess and calm some very upset passengers down. Eventually we were allowed to get aboard - we were going to be flown to Gaborone and there board another plane to go to Johannesburg. During the flight the captain apologized and told us that the change was because of some technical problems with the other plane. The transition in Gaborone was smooth. We eventually arrived in Johannesburg at 18:36 and I am sure some passengers missed their connecting flights. They were assured that there would be ground staff in Johannesburg to assist them with the transitions. We were all put in the same bus to the terminals and I did not see any assistants when we arrived at the terminals. My biggest issue with Air Botswana is not being truthful with us, their paying customers, in some instances flat-out lying and then dumping us on an unaware operator flight crew, leaving them to attend to upset and frustrated passengers. Very unprofessional.",Negative,Positive
Air Botswana,airline,Jennifer Fuller,2014-09-17,I will never fly Air Botswana again. Warning to anyone who is considering flying with them: if you expect even mediocre customer service do yourself a favor and stay away. We were supposed to fly from Maun with Air Botswana to land in Johannesburg landing at 4 pm with a full four hours to spare before our long haul flight back to the US via Delta. When we arrived at the Maun airport chaos had ensued. What appeared to be a huge tour group had the spotlight and despite reaching the front of the line to check in we were completely ignored as the attendants told us they needed to tend to others first. Service was exorbitantly slow as there were only 2 attendants who were hand writing boarding passes. After an hour of waiting we were told the flight was oversold and we would not be getting on. We’re convinced that although we had booked our flights 6 months earlier we were bumped along with about 20 others from the flight in favor of the tour group. You can imagine the hysteria as the majority of the 20 had connecting flights in Johannesburg. The attendants assured us that we would get on another plane that was routed to Cape Town but would first stop in Johannesburg to drop us off by 6 pm. We found this odd but at that point had no other choice. It was only after we boarded the plane that we discovered we were instead going to Gaborone and from there another plane would take us to Johannesburg immediately. When we reached Gaborone the Air Botswana rep was extremely confused why we had arrived and told us we had been lied to and would have to wait another 1.5 hours to take off. Not surprisingly the flight was further delayed so we finally arrived in Jo'burg at 8.30 minutes after our second leg to Atlanta took off. We were extremely upset but told we’d be waitlisted for the next Delta flight out - which unfortunately was not for a full 24 hours. The real kicker? We were told you owe us $650 USD. Still can’t quite comprehend how they had the gall to say this to our faces but at this point nothing surprised us. No reps from either Air Botswana or Delta were available to give us a definitive answer on whether we’d be guaranteed to be on the flight so off we went to a local hotel in hopes of returning the next day to get everything straightened out. The people who work for this airline not only have the poorest customer service skills I have ever witnessed. When we arrived on day 2 to try to check in to Delta we were told we only had a 50/50 shot of getting on the plane. There is one flight per day and subsequent flights were all booked solid. We were beginning to think this nightmare might continue on for days and days. Surely there had to be a carrier going to any city in the US that could accommodate us. There was. Two in fact. However Air Botswana would need to book it for us – and they flat out refused. We were only able to get on the Delta flight thanks to their management; the Air Botswana rep was never to be heard from again. I could not be more appalled at the way Air Botswana operates.,Negative,Positive
Air Burkina,airline,Zvi Rosen,2019-02-11,"I was booked to fly non stop from Abidjan to Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) with Air Burkina. Their website was surprisingly easy to maneuver ,and in a few minutes my ETKT was issued. I guess i was smart to ask the Concierge at my hotel in Abidjan to confirm my flight the day before.Air Burkina had my email,but no notices whatsoever re the dramatic change.To my unpleasant surprise he was told my flight was cancelled, and i was rebooked on a different flight at 0800 rather than 1115. I was at the check in counters at 0600 per the instructions of the reservation office in Abidjan. Im sure the Concierge understood well the new information he received from Air Burkina's office. To my unpleasant surprise i was refused to be checked in and was told to wait, as 'there is a problem with my ticket'. I waited patiently till ALL passengers were checked in, and then i was told by hand signs (No English spoken by the check in supervisor) that the flight is full, and to go and see the agents at Air Burkina's office in the terminal. There i was told by an agent that I'm booked on a different flight at 3pm. I insisted that i had a seat on the early morning flight, as i trusted the information i got from the hotel in the city. I was promised i had a seat at 3pm,but already i had my doubts at that point. I asked why they didn't accept me on the 0800 flight as they cancelled my original flight, and even if i had no reservation per their version, i thought i was entitled to standby for the morning flight. ""No"" was the answer. Reason: the flight was stopping in Accra where it was going to be filled up 100%. I told the agents that i thank them for their efforts, and i am not going to wait 8 hours at the airport for 'maybe' flying at 3pm. I left their office trying to figure out a way out of Ivory Coast as i had a Business class ticket on Ethiopian from Ouagadougou to Addis Ababa, and hoped Ethiopian Airlines would reissue my ticket to fly from Abidjan to Addis. Suddenly i was approached by the Air Burkina agent, who offered me to pay 'penalty' for a flight change from 3pm to 8 am of 50Euro - I had to pay Air Burkina 50 EURO because THEY cancelled my flight. Amazing! The 100% full flight from Accra excuse was no longer an issue. I decided to pay despite the convoluted business conduct of Air Burkina, so i don't miss my visit to Burkina Faso for 50 Euro. I paid, and quickly was rushed to the aircraft. Out of Accra there were at least 20 empty seats and Business class was 100% empty. So much for correct information. The aircraft was an ex LOT airliner in terrible shape, torn seats, dirty cabin, toilets without toilet paper. Drinks were served from Abidjan to Accra's 30 minute flight,and a hot tasty meal was offered on the 1 hour flight from Accra to Ouagadougou. Quite impressive service.

It was a flight accident and the airport did not work for 2 hours, but most of the flights were not cancelled just delayed. Air Canada cancelled the flight with no reason",Negative,Positive
Air Canada,airline,David Boyd,2025-02-12,"This trip included one stopover and two legs. The first flight was from Brussels. The pilot announced that they were delaying the flight to allow for transferring passengers to make our flight. That decision meant that we lost our spot in the de-icing process (at the gate) and then lost our take off spot. We were two hours late departing. We arrived in Montreal, and the ground personnel provided boarding passes to passengers who would not make their connections. I was told that mine would be okay, and others were making the same connection. We cleared customs and made it to the gate 10 minutes before the gate was to close. Management had decided to send the flight early. They closed the gate 12 minutes before the published time on our boarding cards. This meant delays, rerouting through Toronto and more delays before arriving at my final destination. I was 10 hours late in arriving. Only once was I apologized to by a staff member. The rest of them blamed someone else. The actual flights themselves were reasonable, comfortable and safe. But management's decisions both in Brussels and Montreal and then in Customer Service, were horrendous and they refused to take responsibility for them. The airline is liable to pay compensation. When contacted, they said that it was due to the weather. When I presented the trip facts, they never responded to those facts. I was not the only passenger to miss that flight due to management's decision to close the gate and send the flight early.",Negative,Positive

At the end of the 2 hours another hour delay then cancelled. No information or communication throughout the day and no help or options given that we had checked luggage. Other flights delayed and no flight to same destination offered by the end of the day. Had to change destinations after losing a whole day of our trip in an airport with nothing.",Negative,Positive
Air Canada rouge,airline,Sabrina Hohn,2024-10-22,"If it wasn’t for the convenience of the timings, we would never fly air Canada Rouge again, based on our last experience. To start, the aircraft was 26 years old (Airbus 319, reg C-GARJ) and it showed. The “business class” seats were beyond worn and uncomfortable and there was no inflight entertainment or wifi. The purser/inflight director/in charge was what really made for an unbelievable experience. Sitting on my own, I was ignored on 2 separate occasions, and when I finally spoke up, I was told that she is not used to seeing passengers sitting alone and therefore didn’t notice me. Nice! Drink orders had to be repeated more than once, and overall she seemed very unprofessional. I work in the airline industry and the fact that all window blinds as far as I could see were closed during taxiing and take off which I know for a fact is against DOT regulations. The fact that I paid such an outrageous amount of money for 2 business class seats for me and my wife on this decrepit airplane with sub standard inflight service is an absolute joke and Air Canada/Rouge should be ashamed.",Negative,Positive
Air Canada rouge,airline,K Harper,2024-10-07,"For an airline in a country that is all about inclusivity they make sure you know your place. No inflight entertainment, No wifi, Not even a USB port to charge your device. Did Air Canada have to special order a plane and ask for the USB ports to be removed? They also make sure to let you know what you are NOT getting in the announcements. The person making these announcements could be at least be a little humble or pleasant in their delivery. I get it, I was in economy, but some stuff like no USB port is Air Canada making sure to let you know you are in peasant class. Zero is not an option for the ratings, so where there is a 1 star, it is only because zero is not available and it should be as there was no entertainment or connectivity........or dare I say it, no USB port. Perhaps use this plane for cargo, wait! They are.",Negative,Positive

Air Canada rouge,airline,Alex Hoyos,2024-08-17,"About a year ago my flight Toronto-Bogota was cancelled. Myself and probably other 200 people were lining up at the Air Canada customer service booth, to ask what to do. They closed the booth at 10pm and left myself and probably 100 people more stranded, with no information, no nothing. At the gate Air Canada employees were not able to provide any info/help either. I had to stay in Toronto's airport until next day, but still nothing. In the end I had to figure out how to get to my destination with no help from Air Canada. At that time I thought that was just a temporary thing, since I have been using Air Canada for over 2 decades with no regrets. Today, after a year, I am booking a flight using a travel advisor. She tells me that what happened to me last year is still happening to people today. That Air Canada continues to cancel flights left and right and leaves people stranded at the Airport in Toronto.

Paid a premium booking a same day which is fine, however, I booked a comfort ticket and was given row 33D. I boarded zone 3, as one of the first passengers to board in the zone and was told I would have to check my bag. I asked if it was a gate check and they said yes you check it here and it goes to the carousel (not gate check by any airline definition). Sure enough, I arrive at my seat and the luggage bin is empty and remained so for the flight. I asked the flight attendant why this constantly happens and she said “we are volunteers before the flight and don’t get paid”. By itself, it’s really not a big issue, but when you are flying 2-3 times per week waiting an hour in every city is frustrating when there is capacity for bags on the plane. I flew about 10 times of 130 total flights last year on Rouge and each and every time there is some kind of service issue not too mention I was 2 for 10 on time vs. 2 delays out of a 100 flights on Delta (this flight was delayed for over an hour).

Air Canada rouge,airline,J Hayes,2023-12-12,"Our flights from Houston to Quebec City were purchased on aircanada.com, and we reserved and paid for assigned seats for our traveling group of 6 (including family members, professional colleagues, and friends) on a single Air Canada booking reference. Upon arrival in Toronto, we were informed that our YYZ-YQB flight was delayed one hour because of a change of aircraft. It happens. But do note carefully: The change of aircraft was from one A321 to another A321. While one of Air Canada Rouge’s A321 may be configured slightly differently from another, the bulk of the seating is located in the economy section, and it is uniformly and predictably 6 across – 3 on each side of the center aisle. Perhaps the first-class section may be plus or minus a row or 2, which would result in the necessity of some changes of seat assignments in the economy section, but the overwhelming bulk of the seats and seat assignments need not be changed. Our assigned and paid-for seats were 19D, E, and F and 20 D, E, and F – all on the right side of the aircraft (by choice) and none were located in the front 2 rows of economy nor in the rear 2 rows of economy. As we boarded the gate agent informed us of a seat assignment change. One married couple in our group was seated together in the middle of the aircraft, but the rest of us were scattered throughout rear half of the economy section, with 5 of the 6 being in middle seats, including 3 of us in the middle seats of the last 3 rows of the aircraft. This is inexcusable. Why was our traveling-together-on-a-single-booking-reference group treated so disrespectfully? Perhaps 12 or so passengers of the entire aircraft may have needed to be moved, but why us, again I say traveling together as a group on a single booking reference? Because they could provide no explanation for the problem and were powerless to make it better, two Air Canada Rouge employees (the gate agent and a pilot!) suggested I raise the complaint.",Negative,Positive
Air Caraibes,airline,Serge Bonneure,2020-07-06,"Our flight was canceled due to the Covid-19 issues, but from Air Caraïbes we never received mails concerning our canceled flight. Once we figured out ourselves, we were offered (by text on the website) to change date.  So in fact only the date that was affected was changeable, meaning our holiday was shortened by several weeks! Almost never did a new search for a reservation work. It was not available or simply not possible. No reason was given. You receive error messages in code (no text, but numbers with no explanation whatsoever) for whatever you try to do. They offer no help at all. The chat on the website is a robot that is not even capable of understanding what your question is and responded with answers we never asked for. Asking for help by phone is impossible and not even free. I already had to rebook my flight 4 times and every time the same mess again. Eventually since July they offer a refund in cash (to your credit card). Although I was legit for a full refund by reading the needed conditions on their site, once I submitted for the refund, I got a message saying that in my 'specific' situation I need to call Air Carraïbes for further assistance and predictable as I had read in many other reviews. No one is responding my call. In no way is it possible to get decent help or assistance and figuring out if everything is still in the running is all up to you to follow up your booking. For 2 of the rebookings I was going to receive a small refund of €21. Even today no refund was given. But in the cases where I had to pay a supplement, before realizing it, it was already taken from my credit card. As soon as you receive your new tickets with new dates, you receive a message in your account that dates are canceled or will not be available (again). It's terrible how they treat their customers. Never flown with them and never intend to in the future. To be clear, we have a ticket and booked a flight, but we were so far not able to fly, change dates or receive a refund or a better date to fly in the future. So our choice never to fly them in the future is because of the lack of a respectful customer service.",Negative,Positive

Their customer service just sent us in circles: call this number, call back tomorrow, submit a ticket here, email this address, call this other number.

First, my French isn't great so I had to find out at Pointe a Pitre that I needed to check in but I didn't need to pick up my hold baggage. So that meant I had 2 hours of queuing to check in, go through customs and security leaving it very fine to get my flight. Luckily, the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 so there was no rush. The boarding process was confusing and disorganised with continual announcements apologising for delays, calling babies, children, rows and a reminder that seats EFGH boarded through gate A, seats ABCD boarded through gate B. The FAS were ok. Apart from when they left our food on our trays for 40 minutes, I took our trays up in the end and they said they forgot. They also left a full cup of coffee in the holder for landing despite us trying to ask them to take it away. Food was not great especially the tub of apple puré/ baby food and a bread roll for breakfast. The in flight entertainment was limited for English speakers and we arrived late so I missed my connecting flight. They also left baggage from everyone who connected from Saint Martin in Point a Pitre. Which was weird considering we were delayed. I called customer service to try and upgrade my flight in the hope an upgrade would make the return journey less unpleasant. My french isn't great which I explained but the customer service girl lost patience and cut me off. I will never fly Air Caraïbes again.",Negative,Positive
Air China,airline,7 reviewsShadi Alkasim,2025-02-08,"This was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have ever been on. I had initially booked with Cathay Pacific (flight CX6122) from Hong Kong to Chengdu, expecting their usual high standards. However, it turned out to be a joint flight operated by Air China (flight 412), and the experience was disappointing. The plane felt old-fashioned (A320-200), with cramped seats, no in-flight entertainment, no Wi-Fi, and little legroom. The cleanliness was lacking, and the quality of the food was disappointing. Adding to the discomfort, some passengers were loud, others were inconsiderate, and the cabin was filled with foul odors. When I asked the crew for help, I was surprised that the flight attendants could not speak English, which made communication difficult. Fortunately, after trying to communicate with two of them, a third flight attendant came. She spoke English and was kind and helpful, and eventually moved my daughter and me to better seats. Upon landing, several passengers ignored basic etiquette, got up prematurely, and acted in a disruptive manner. This flight was more like a crowded public bus than a flying experience. While Cathay Pacific is a reputable airline, the codeshare partnership with Air China could be damaging to its brand. I hope they reconsider these arrangements to maintain their high standards.",Negative,Positive

No meal offered on a more than 2 hours flight, only luke warm ordinary champagne served in the kind of soft plastic ""glasses"" you find in office water fountains.

Good news: Air Dolomiti (owner: Lufthansa) is still late on my travels. This time, it was only 30 minutes! They are improving. Excuse: ""We left Frankfurt late"". The problem is that Air Dolomiti connects me to my international flights, so when they are late, they have no time to transfer my luggage from the their small jet onto the connecting flight's jet. The result: 3 out of the last 6 of my international flights have had my luggage not arrive at the destination airport.

Cannot figure out why they even bother to hand out single postage-stamp sized cookie or the single square of chocolate. Why bother? It's just a token, and not a useful one in my opinion. Better to just not hand out anything instead of that fattening little single bite of food. Secondly, staff uniforms seem strange to me: a business suit with a golf shirt underneath and no tie. Third, the pilots tend to keep the seat belt sign on for entire flights, even when there is no turbulence.

Then came the selling of the headphones - the IFE was not working paying 3 euros for a set of headphones. The first meal service was not bad, the chicken is better than the pasta. But what I found incredible was there were no more free drinks. The crew hardly ever left the galley, they made themselves a little den with curtains.

Air France,airline,Andrew H Neal,2025-02-18,"As a producer for Discovery Channel documentaries, where scheduling is as tight as budgets, I depend heavily on airlines to uphold their schedules. Unfortunately, my recent experience with Air France was nothing short of a disaster, showcasing a complete breakdown in both service and accountability. Our flight from LHR to CDG to SXM on January 10th started with arriving at LHR at the early hour of 3:15 AM for a 6:20 AM departure. The check-in process did not commence until 4:00 AM, and from then until 5:45 AM, absolutely nothing progressed. The Air France staff were visibly present but unhelpful, offering no explanations for the delay nor managing the growing line of anxious passengers. Despite multiple inquiries, the only information provided was about a computer malfunction. No alternative solutions were offered. Check-ins were eventually processed manually using cell phones, which was inefficient and caused significant delays. Our flight, as a result, left over five hours late. Due to the initial delay, we were forced to find and book an alternate flight to reach our destination, which was essential to keep our production on track. This not only added stress but also financial strain to our tightly budgeted project. On our return trip, Air France added insult to injury by charging us an additional 1,000 euros due to the missed original flight, blaming us for a problem they created. The return flight was no better, with a detour for refueling and another delay in Paris before finally arriving late in London. Throughout this ordeal, not once did any Air France representative offer a genuine apology or a practical solution, effectively stranding us without care. After these multiple failures, seeking compensation or even an acknowledgment of the inconvenience from Air France has been an uphill battle. The lack of empathy and assistance from their customer service is appalling, with representatives implying that the fault was ours for not tolerating their inefficiency. This experience has been a sobering reminder of how a company should not operate. Air France’s disregard for customer service and basic accountability has not only resulted in financial losses for our production but also an incredible waste of time and energy. I strongly advise against booking with Air France if your travel plans require reliability and professional service.",Negative,Positive
Air France,airline,Marinelle van de Velde,2025-02-04,"In December my husband and I flew to Mauritius: a 2 week holiday after a busy year (at 61 and 63). We were going to fly Business Class (for the first time) ; we were so excited to leave. This trip was going to be more than amazing... and it was - apart from the experience with Air France. The departure flight was disastrous due to the heavy turbulence. It was so bad all night long that we couldn't fold down, just bad luck due to the weather conditions. The service of the staff and crew on board was impeccable. Nothing to say. So far, all good! After 2 wonderful weeks on the spot we check in online for the return flight to Belgium (via Paris) and discover that we are not sitting next to each other. We call AF Brussels and an arrogant Dutch lady (merger KLM) tells us that we only had to pay 150 euros per person/one way to sit next to each other, on top of the Business price. Good to know! But that was just the beginning of the misery. On Christmas Day, December 25, the alarm goes off at 5 am to take us to the airport at 6:30 am for our flight home. Then my husband saw the email that AF had sent at 4 am. 1h30 delay on arrival in Paris, no more train connection to Brussels and the hotel we had booked in Brussels (145 euros) was unfortunately too late to cancel. We called AF Brussels, where a Dutch lady, even more arrogant than the previous lady, told us that we had to book a hotel on arrival in Paris and file a complaint. Good to know! The flight to Paris went very well and we arrived in Paris. After asking for explanations several times, we finally found the right place and joined a long line of passengers who were in the same situation as us. A lady offered us a night at the Ibis or the Melia, but before we got there, we had to: - Pick up our suitcases (15 minutes walk) - Crossing the entire airport with the suitcases to find the train to the hotel (20 minutes walk) - Searching for the hotel outside without lights for 20 minutes and this at almost midnight. The happiness of two weeks in paradise in Mauritius quickly disappeared. After a short night, we have to leave again at 5:30 in the morning to take the train to Brussels. On December 26, we finally arrived home at 2:00 p.m. (we left on December 25 at 6:30 a.m.), so it is not possible for us to go back to work on December 26 as planned! What an unforgettable Christmas! But it is not over yet: AF informs us that the delay does not entitle us to compensation/damages due to the bad weather conditions, where there was not a single cloud and the sky was oh so clear. They lie and deny all responsibility… as if it were our fault! We travel often, but in all the years we travel economy class, we have never experienced such an unfair situation: no respect for travelers and a dishonest airline. Conclusion: Mauritius is a dream, but AIR France is a nightmare!

Air Greenland,airline,Mike Ryan,2023-12-02,"The product offered by Air Greenland is vastly different between their A330 jet service from Copenhagen and their propeller Dash 8 flights within Greenland. My overall rating covers my entire experience. The A330 to and from Copenhagen was actually very good. Nice modern aircraft, very friendly crew, decent cold meal service and 2 drink services. Seat back entertainment but no headphones provided or sold so remember to take your own standard headphones with a small jack connection. I'd rate that part as 4 stars out of 5. The internal Air Greenland Dash 8 planes were basic and tired inside, no entertainment and only a drink offered. Tighter seating but friendly staff, I'd rate that as 3 star. The onboard experience all in all was ok but its the behind the scenes I have issue with. Firstly with the 4 flights we had, I had around 10 schedule changes before departure between 15 mins and a few hours, so really need to keep an eye on them. My biggest annoyance was both cases were damaged but as it was the zipper lock mechanism smashed it was deemed the wrong type of damage for them to offer any assistance. Both cases are unusable without repair but Air Greenland aren't interested at the airport or at their customer relations centre. So taking that into account I rate as 2 out of 5 overall.",Negative,Positive

Air Greenland overbooked and to solve the problem they did not select someone who bought last, but the one who paid more. Odd and unique logic as the person who bumped me bought a Flexible ticket because there were no Restricted Tickets left. So the highest bidder gets the seat. I had my Travel agent inquire as to whether I would be bumped again on the return and she got no reply. I was not bumped as the person who got my seat returned on a private jet as he met a friend on his travels. He had purchased long after me and had no seat assignments.

On the return Maniitsoq airport only opened at noon due to weather problems [not uncommon] and they tried to combine two flights, but we were over-weight, so 8 passengers had to be left behind, for 2 days for the next flight.

Air India,airline,S Mareesha,2025-02-28,"My mother was traveling alone from JFK New York to Varanasi via New Delhi, and what should have been a manageable journey turned into an unacceptable nightmare. When I initially booked her ticket, she had a 2.5-hour layover in Delhi— more than enough time to transfer flights. However, just two days before departure, Air India changed the flight schedule, reducing her transit time to just 30 minutes. Concerned, I immediately called their customer service, who assured me that 30 minutes was sufficient and that ground staff would assist her in catching her next flight. Even when my mom checked in at the JFK airport prior to here flight, she mentioned about this and they told her she will be assisted by a ground staff. That was a blatant lie. When my mother arrived in Delhi, there was nobody to assist her. She was left stranded and, despite doing her best to catch her connection, she missed it.  Air India staff told her there were no available flights for two days. They made no effort to rebook her on another airline. They refused to provide any meaningful assistance. My mother has severe anxiety issues, and I had to calm her down over the phone while booking her a flight on a different airline for the next day. The only thing Air India offered was a refund for the missed flight, which should have never been necessary in the first place. On her return journey from Delhi to JFK, she arrived at the airport 3 hours early, only to be told there was an issue with her ticket. The reason? Because she didn’t take the Delhi to Varanasi flight, her entire ticket was ""frozen"" — a term the customer service agent used. We were not informed that this would happen. The Air India app still showed the ticket as confirmed. The ground staff was rude, dismissive, and completely unhelpful. To make matters worse, they outright told her there would be no refund for the ticket they canceled due to their own delay. This was, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered. The lack of accountability, compassion, and professionalism from Air India’s staff is disgraceful. My family and I will never fly with Air India again.",Negative,Positive

When i asked for a free seat it was denied and in hurry were made to pay for the seat. This is something against our will. No airlines charges extra unless it is preferred seat.,Negative,Positive

Air Italy,airline,David Smith,2019-07-14,"New York JFK to Rome via Milan. First: Ticketing Counter: Very inconvenient counter locations at the airport, the farthest counter from everything, around the corner and hidden behind all other counters that you actually have to ask someone to locate. By the way, they do not affiliate with Air Italy. First I thought it was just at JFK but to my surprise it was the same setup in Rome. Seems like they picked the cheapest counters at the airport. Second: Leg Room: Let's start with tight seats with no leg room, they do not meet the standard requirements. Once the seat in front of me is reclined, I literally was trapped and could not get up. I could not even close the food tray that was jammed on my lap. Wanted to reach out to flight attendant for help but obviously couldn’t reach out the overhead help button. No one walked by for hours until dinner time, but even then she was not able to help. As if people in economy do not matter at all. I understand that they have to treat upper class customers better but they cannot ignore economy class to that level. Third: Baggage Fee: No charge for luggage from US to Rome but they hit you with 'No luggage allowed' policy for economy unless you pay 100 euro each. As if it’s not the same bag came on the flight in to Rome. Why charge only one leg of the flight? When I refused the pay, they referred me to the supervisor who finally showed up after half an hour but was not helpful at all. In fact she was extremely rude and pretty much said to us “this the way it is whether you like or not”.",Positive,Negative

Re-booked for a Puerto Galera to Manila flight in March 2019 (and had to pay an extra 1,000 pesos for the privilege). Days before that flight it was also cancelled for - you guessed it - routine maintenance. This time I opted for a refund and after filling out and returning the form was told it would take 25 to 30 working days to process. 40 days later, I'm still waiting for my refund.

Air Macau,airline,A Herlen,2025-01-29,"Online check-in was not possible and it was not possible to receive the boarding pass. The app is a joke; you can't do anything there. At the airport you had to wait in line for about an hour to get your boarding pass. In addition, the check-in counters were only opened at the last moment. This was the first time I had to wait so long for my boarding pass. We received free meals and drinks on board, but unfortunately there were no vegetarian options. The plane looked old, but was still within the realm of possibility. The distance between the seats was okay. Last but not least, the connecting flight from Macau to Danang was delayed for two hours. Therefore, we arrived in Danang at midnight, which was very unfortunate. This was my first experience with this airline and I will try to avoid it as much as possible in the future.  Online Check-in war nicht möglich, und man konnte die Bordkarte nicht erhalten. Die App ist ein Witz; man kann dort gar nichts machen. Am Flughafen musste man etwa eine Stunde anstehen, um die Bordkarte zu bekommen. Zudem wurden die Check-in-Schalter erst im letzten Moment geöffnet. Das war das erste Mal, dass ich so lange auf meine Bordkarte warten musste. An Bord erhielten wir kostenlose Mahlzeiten und Getränke, aber leider gab es keine vegetarischen Gerichte. Das Flugzeug sah alt aus, war aber dennoch im Rahmen des Möglichen. Der Abstand zwischen den Sitzen war okay. Zu guter Letzt hatte der Anschlussflug von Macau nach Danang eine zweistündige Verspätung. Deshalb kamen wir um Mitternacht in Danang an, was sehr unglücklich war.

In particular, their reservations team were really helpful when we had problems with our travel agent, travelgenio. Our original flight was cancelled by Air Macau 2 weeks before departure, which was annoying but they offered us a selection of four alterative flights (via our travel agent). Our travel agent then gave us the wrong rebooked flight details. We therefore didn't turn up to the airport for the flight and we looked like a no show to Air Macau. Travel agent took no responsibility for their error and we were worried we would have to pay for a new ticket. However, a quick call to Air Macau customer services and they rebooked us onto a flight the following day for no extra charge. Brilliant! Departure experience: There was a bit of a queue at check in but not abnormally long. 1.5hr flight included a pork roll, cookie and water which was a nice touch. All the staff were friendly too. I suppose one downside was that there was no inflight entertainment and electrical sockets, but that didn't bother us on such a short flight.

When I contacted them they said there was a flight on the Monday but it was full so they rebooked her for the Wednesday flight. As she was going to Malawi for 2 weeks this would have made her trip very short. Finally I managed to get her on the monday flight. Air Malawi have two scheduled flights a week from Nairobi to Lilongwe. Monday and Friday. But they book people for all seven days of the week. If enough people book they fly if they don't they cancel the flight. The thing that really annoyed me was that I chose to use Air Malawi because they told me they fly every day. If I had known the truth I would have used Kenya Airways who admit they have only two flights a week. The second thing that annoyed me was that there was not even a hint of an apology from them for cancelling the flight. If you are trying to go to Malawi my advice is to use Kenya Airways. They are more expensive - but they will get you there when they say you will and if they can't at least they will say sorry!",Negative,Positive
Air Malta,airline,R Lanson,2023-11-09,"In October 2023, I was supposed to fly from Malta to Tel Aviv, but the airline cancelled the flight due to the Israel-Hamas war.

The two additional nights in the hotel, the fare difference between the original and new flight and the additional flight back to Israel cost me nearly EUR 1,000. Not only that, when I booked the new flight to Larnaca, I requested 2 additional check-in bags similar to the original flight that was cancelled. I was told each bag would be EUR 40 each. Only after booking the new flight, I was told that in fact the ticket they sold me was operated by a different airline (Emirates), and that I can only pay for the additional baggage at the airport before the flight. Imagine my shock when checking in at the airport, Emirates charged me EUR 237 per additional bag!! I was told the EUR 40 per bag was not correct.

Air Mauritius,airline,Srikar Yekollu,2025-01-18,"DXB-MRU and MRU-TNR went through uneventfully. Flight MK289 was delayed by about 3 hours on 13th April. The flight departed at 19:49 instead of 17:00 and arrived at 22:33 instead of 19:45.  While we noticed that the flight hadn't boarded, the crew told us at 5PM that the flight which was supposed to come from MRU had not even taken off from MRU. Until 5PM (departure time) we were not even notified that the flight would be delayed.  We were given a coupon for water or coffee. On landing at MRU, we waited at the transfer desk for more than 2 hours (22:33 to around 00:45) before we were led outside of immigration to figure out a plan for us to reach DXB. Other passengers without families were provided a seat on the flight next day while those with families were deprioritized.  I had a child who did not have dinner and was forced to wait at immigration without food. At around 00:45 we were led downstairs to an area near departures and asked to wait while they found a hotel for us. We were given a couple of bottles of water and a blanket for the child in the meanwhile.  We waited until 04:45 before we told to get on a bus to a hotel and that the reservations desk which opens at 8AM will let us know about the fate of our remaining journey.  We got an email the next day at 10:46AM that we would be travelling  from MRU to BOM and BOM to DXB. I called the reservations desk and after waiting for 40 mins on hold, I was told that this is the only itinerary that will be offered and the next direct flight is on 18th. They also told me that if I chose the 18th flight, the airline would not pay for accommodation until 18th. Here is my complaint about the experience: I paid extra money to choose a direct flight from MRU to DXB in the presence of other cheaper itineraries. The experience I got was far from ideal even without considering that I was travelling with a child.  The airline did not prioritize families with children when rebooking.

The representative informed us to write to you for a refund of the tickets plus an additional 250 euros per passenger as compensation to cover the cost of making alternate arrangements. We had to take a cab to Tirana the next day, purchase new tickets, and fly from there to Rome.

Air Namibia,airline,1 reviewsEd Reblin,2020-01-18,"It was the first time I flew Air Namibia in June 19 in Business Class: thinking it was/would be a good and short flight from Cape Town via Windhoek to Frankfurt in business, but what I then experienced, was definitely not cool. Ok, the total cost/fare I paid was less than other comparable airlines at that point in time: but the fact that first of all my connection flight, from Cape Town to Windhoek, which was originally scheduled to only need about 1 hour for transit, was actually then cancelled. Hence I was advised - just a few days before departure then - to use a flight from Cape Town to Windhoek much earlier, leading to a like a 4 hour stopover on Windhoek. Not what I wanted, and also why I did not take another airline into consideration - then I could already have chosen Ethiopian or Turkish etc with a similar stopover time. Anyhow: so: the lounge in Windhoek is not a business lounge-like anywhere else in the world. It is so bad: no proper food, not adequate seats, no service - nothing, not even adequate toilets. Ok, the beer is ok - if that is what you need to survive. Now back to the plane: The service is more than just reasonable - nothing special - but for sure not business class standard. The seats are worn out - but I must admit flat seat at least. But that is basically all I can say positively. All the rest is not business class-related and feeling old. Food, just ok, hardly any selection of drinks and the worst thing: I do not know what really happened to my luggage: it arrived - ok - but in such bad condition. I hardly have ever seen before. So I must assume and believe that happened during the long transfer/transit in Windhoek as described above (as I travel a lot from and to Cape Town) but this trip definitely did wear out my luggage.",Negative,Positive
Air New Zealand,airline,Phillip Stirton,2025-01-07,Travelled with Air New Zealand on Boeing 787-9 Auckland to Honolulu in business class. The ground handling was some of the best I have experienced. Regrettably the experience quickly became more than a little disappointing. The layout in herringbone pattern resulted in providing no privacy and very limited space. Given that the herringbone style was already discredited by the time ANZ introduced this pattern it is hard to understand why they went with that option. The appalling layout was only exceeded by the extremely poor onboard service with poor menu choice and failure to provide the supper and breakfast requested. It gave the impression that the attendants didn't know what they were doing or were not interested. As a long term user of ANZ and having found their service/product very competitive this latest experience has left me looking to other airlines for long haul flights - what a shame !,Negative,Positive

What was most disappointing is that no Air New Zealand staff showed the courtesy to suggest that my wife sit somewhere more comfortable with our newborn. After some time, I had to request assistance myself, and only then were they allowed to sit. Meanwhile, I stood waiting for an hour for tickets I had already purchased online. Boarding the plane was no better. There was no separate line or prioritization for families with infants or elderly passengers, something I’ve consistently seen handled much better by airlines like Air Canada. Based on this experience, I don’t think I’ll be flying with Air New Zealand again.",Neutral,Positive
Air Niugini,airline,N Mullins,2025-02-28,Absolutely obscene baggage fees at the airport. Instructions for extra baggage on website are not sufficient.

Only fly this airline if it is your only option.,Negative,Positive
Air Niugini,airline,6 reviewsKai Kohlberger,2024-08-20,"A disgrace of an airline. Arrived at check in three hours in advance of departure time just to find out that they had bumped me off the flight. They essentially killed off the second half of my holidays. Check in itself was a farce. Although at the top of the queue, it was a very long wait as counter staff and security let selected people through first who then also make their friends jump the queue. Staff is not very friendly and unapologetic. No explanation was provided why it was me who was there well in advance and had purchased the ticket many months in advance cannot fly. A promised refund can only be requested by email apparently. I am sure I have to fight for that too.",Negative,Positive

We had to stay in POM for two days before finally flying out. We had relatives waiting for us in Popondetta during this time who had to travel a long distance to meet us and wait. Now coming home our flight from Popondetta was over two and a half hours delayed. This means that we will miss the flight from POM to Brisabane, and probably staying another night in POM. Absolutely disgraceful service from this company.

Air Niugini,airline,N Kong,2023-04-08,"Air Niugini has ruined my Easter holiday. I have a holiday reservation at Walindi Plantation Resort, Kimbe, from 7-10/4. I have booked Air Niugini domestic flight from Port Moresby to Hoskins on 7/4. The 7/4 is canceled with a SMS notification at 10am on 7/4, and rescheduled to 8/4 3.25pm, which is fine as it's only one day difference. I check in again for 8/4, and this flight is further delayed to 4.45pm without any notification during the dropping of my luggage at counter, well, which is also fine for me as it's only 1 hour plus delay. Finally when we are supposed to queue up for boarding, at 4.45pm sharp, the airline makes announcement to cancel the flight, and reschedule to the next day 9/4, for departure at ridiculous 4.55am. If you can't afford to operate the flight, just don't take my booking or notify earlier in case of flight change so that we can manage our travel. For what that you still check us in, and get us waiting in the boarding lounge just for your cancellation announcement, instead of a departure. The customer service counter is full of chaos with the staff having no compassion to comfort the frustrated crowds.",Negative,Positive

Air Pegasus,airline,Vivek Raghupathy,2016-07-13,Air Pegasus cancelled my flight two times and I was forced to change my travel date at last minute. I booked flight OP103 BLR-TRV departing 18:30. Few weeks before the departure date they informed me that they are cancelling the flight due to operational reasons. So they modified my booking and provided seats in OP101 BLR-TRV departing at 06:30. The evening before the departure they cancelled OP101 stating operational reasons. I called their customer care number. I could not speak to anyone until 21:30. When I asked them for alternate arrangement they said they dont have any flights and asked me to reschedule my trip for 1 day later. They refused to provide a seat in other airlines. Only option they gave were to cancel the booking or to fly at the later date. The last minute fares were so high that I could not afford to cancel and book on another airline. So I was forced to change my travel date. This is a very common practice of Air Pegasus. There are many issues related to last minute cancellation reported by passengers. Beware of Air Pegasus. Anytime they can cancel the flights stating operational reasons.,Negative,Positive
Air Senegal,airline,C Burtel,2024-07-06,"Senegal Airlines first delayed flight 213 for five hours then said they could not take me although I had a confirmed business class ticket.

They sent me and nine other passengers to the Azalai Hotel in Dakar, which was about an hour from the airport, but when we arrived at the hotel they had no reservation for any of us. The hotel required that I pay out of pocket for the room which cost 130,000 CAF (214.00 USD). Although the airline paid for the taxi to take us to the hotel. I had to pay for a taxi back to the airport. That cost 35,000 CAF (57.86 USD). I am claiming for the two costs or a total of 271.86 USD.

Air Senegal,airline,Johan Forsberg,2024-01-13,"After having lived in Africa for more than seven years (Mozambique) in addition to now frequently traveling for work I thought I had seen everything. In terms of poor management, traveling with Air Senegal was surprisingly bad. No communication or information, clueless staff and no compensation or willingness to assist passengers (elderly, young, families etc.). My flight from Dakar to Praia was 5hrs late, which was more than the average delay on their flights (3.5hrs). The aircraft supposed to take us to Praia departed for Conakry at the same time as we were supposed to take-off. After speaking with ground staff it became clear that it’s a management strategy/policy - they simply plan more flights (thus, sell more tickets) than their fleet is capable of handling. The operation side of the company have their hands tied as they dont have enough aircrafts or staff to operate according to the route network and timetable, which is reflected on their constant delays.",Negative,Positive

Seriously unorganized transfer process from the airport to the hotel. Endlessly waiting for the bus and losing further time due to the amateur way of boarding the passengers. Instead of taking us to our final destination in Athens, they flew us to Thessaloniki and exhausted us further, by being indecisive on which connecting flight we should board for Athens - at some point, they even suggested us to fly from Belgrade to Vienna and from there to Athens! Upon our arrival at Thessaloniki, our paid for luggage was appearing as unpaid at the system. I know at least another passenger who had to pay again for his already paid luggage.

Air Seychelles,airline,G Dorsen,2022-06-11,"We were booked on a one-way flight from Praslin to Mauritius (PRI-SEZ-MRU). The checkin in Praslin was pretty smooth. The lady told us that our baggage is directed to Mauritius, nothing to worry about on Mahé. Great news! After arrival we had to checkin again as the second flight was international. At the counter I mentioned casually that we only have two backpacks as carry on as our checked baggage is transferred to Mauritius. ""No that is not possible"" we were told. ""You have to pick it up at the baggage claim and check it in again."" After some discussions I went back. Luckily a met a couple from the UK that did the same trip as we did. Same problem there. We found an Air Seychelles employee, explained the situation, gave her our baggage tags we got earlier at Praslin and followed her back to the counter. They were having an argue. Unbelievable. Both flights operated by one airline that does not know their internal procedures and processes. After we were told that the baggage is transferred to Mauritius - surprise - the real problems began as my girlfriend was traveling with her wheelchair that comes with electrically powered wheels. We showed them the necessary IATA certificates and technical specs as we always do in that situation around the globe with many airlines. Airlines are generally not pleased to transport batteries in the cargo area due to potential risk of fire. But in this case the batteries are an integrated part of the wheels. You cannot take them off without taking off both wheels completely. So as usual they checked everything and let us finally continue. So far so good. After boarding was finished the captain announced that we were actually early some minutes.  But suddenly the lady from the check-in appeared at our seats to tell us that the wheelchair will not be transported by Air Seychelles because an approval was missing. We had no idea what she meant. As I already wrote we had shown them the papers. And by the way we had sent the all the documents five days ahead of the flight as requested by Air Seychelles. We never got a reply to that email. They still insisted an approval was missing. Just to mention again: No issues with the same airline on the first flight segment before... However three to four employees were discussing at the aircraft door. After 30 minutes the captain explained the situation to all passengers via speaker. He said they are organizing the missing approval and are waiting for it. What missing approval and how are they organizing it by themselves when the complained that we did not bring the approval. Simply does not make sense at all. After an hour I accidentally could observe a guy walking right next to the aircraft carrying the wheelchair's wheels with the batteries. Minutes later we took off without further information. After arrival in Mauritius we found the wheelchair in parts lying on the floor in front of the special baggage counter. Some idiots bent one of the shafts that connect the wheels to the chassis. Without any tools and with pure force I could barely fix the shaft. Otherwise our trip had ended at this point. We have never ever experienced that kind of discrimination against people with disabilities anywhere on the globe. Totally unprofessional and completely intolerable.

Air Tahiti Nui,airline,Edward Chou,2024-05-17,"We were a family of 7 people, ranging from 7 year old to 80 year old with walking difficulties. It was a midnight flight out of LAX to PPT. The food delivery truck hit the side of our plane. But the gate agents lied to us and kept saying it was ""paperwork"", and ""security"" issues. We all knew that they lied because they didn't want to call it ""mechanical"" issue because they would be liable for the passengers somehow. Then finally around 2 am, they told us the flight was ""delayed"" until that morning at 10 am, and told us to go to ticketing, where they will help us with hotels and transportation. When we got to the ticketing counter, they did not help us at all. They did not offer us any hotel rooms, or transportation help. We were on our own. They offered NO help at all. And we were the 4th party at the counter. Before we left the counter that night / morning, I repeatedly asked the agent if we will have the same assigned seats? Because we had children and elderly passengers. They repeatedly promised me yes, we have the exact same seats. Next morning came. We came back, along with hundreds of passengers. When we got to the counter, the agent scattered the 7 of us all around the plane separately. How incredible is that. We were connecting to Bora Bora, which we already missed due to the flight delay. So I asked the agent about that. She said we will have guaranteed seats the next morning. Don't worry. Well, we didn't. We spent an entire day the next morning in PPT waiting for standby, and we had to fly separately to Bora Bora again. And one more lie. We had no accommodations when we get to PPT, because our final destination was Bora Bora, and by the time we land in PPT, there were no more flights to Bora Bora. So we will need to stay overnight in PPT. The agent told us that there will be someone in their domestic office in Tahiti to help us find lodging. Well, that was a lie too. When we got there, their domestic flight office had closed and no one was there to help us. So we were there again to fend for ourselves. Anyways, I filed a complaint for all the extra costs incurred during the debacle, and the missed hotel stay in Bora Bora. I have been working with one of their agents for almost a year now, via email. He is as unhelpful as anyone can be. I don't feel the customer service attitude. He repeatedly ignores me, drags his feet, as evidenced by it being almost a year!! They have no phone number available to chat with. I have no way of escalating my case. I asked him to talk to his supervisor. Nothing. He just ignores me. I called the only phone number there is for ATN - reservations. I called them and asked to speak to their supervisor, thinking that they might know the supervisor of customer service. I have not heard back from them. Every time I call the number, their supervisor has been at a meeting, and they always tell me the manager would call me back. They never have. Do yourself a favor and ask yourself: Would you go with an airline that doesn't even give you access to proper customer service.? ""Technically"" they have customer service, via email. There is no one to talk to. Just think about that. I have no recourse. I have no way of escalating, and I can't find anyone that is willing to help me. No one cares. Things like this sound crazy whenever I come across them. They sound like it comes from a negative person who likes to complaint or make up stories,  until it happened to me.",Negative,Positive
Air Tahiti Nui,airline,M Heale,2023-07-15,"This review is difficult to write since I was never able to actually fly with Air Tahiti Nui. The company recently had a workers strike that caused them to cancel multiple flights. The issue here isn’t the strike, it is how ATN handled it. Their response to the situation was terrible, with not only a lack of communication to affected passengers, but purposeful misinformation when you spoke to their representatives. My wife and I talked about taking this trip 10 years ago when we got married. We saved our money, spent the last 7 months planning, and then flew to LAX the day before our flight to PPT via ATN. Less than 23 hours before take-off, they cancelled the flight. They provided nothing more than general statements saying they were in the process of rebooking. Then nothing but silence. My wife called their representatives later in the day and were told that we would have a flight out THAT DAY and would be contacting us. Then more silence, nothing. Again called in and were offered a flight 4 days from now, cutting our trip on half. Absolutely unacceptable. We ended up not getting rebooked, not receiving any direct communication from ATN, and had to cancel our trip. If they had been more prepared for this contingency, as most competent enterprises are, they would have had plans in place in why to do when this happens. Instead, we lost our chance to go to Bora Bora. This experience was not unique with many other passengers having to cancel their trips due to Air Tahiti Nui's utter lack of planning and communication. My recommendation is to stay clear of Air Tahiti Nui. They may not be a problem for your trip, but their incompetence is readily apparent. If things go sideways, I don’t trust them to know what they’re doing.",Negative,Positive

We even double checked everything with the cargo office the day prior to the flight. Thankfully, the pilot happened to notice the animals being loaded onto the plane and stopped the process the morning of the flight. The cargo hold had no oxygen and they would've died.

Tanzania has some incredible sights and most people are very friendly and trustworthy. What they don’t have is a trustworthy or competent national airline. I booked a business class ticket ESky. Because it’s a short flight from JRO-ZNZ it was only about $100 more. When I arrived at the airport I was told the original plane was damaged and a replacement was being flown in and they had given my business class seat to someone else. Not wanting to argue I asked them to simply refund the difference between the business class seat I had paid for and the economy seat I received. The answer from the very rude ground attendant was incredible, she said “we can’t afford that”. Then I said just give me a business class ticket on the return flight instead. The manager arrived late and looking like he had just crawled out of bed and was just as rude as the first woman. Flight was very late but non-eventful, cabin crew were nothing special, plane looked pretty worn out, landing was rough. I followed up with Air Tanzania but they don’t know how to answer a phone, can’t read emails or don’t speak English. I also contacted ESky, the ticket agency I used but will never use again, and they have been useless so far. Locals in Tanzania told me to avoid Air Tanzania and use Precision Air instead as an alternative.

Our flight, originally scheduled to depart at 12:00 PM on February 16, 2025, was delayed repeatedly, with no clear explanation or resolution. As of now, it is nearly 12 hours past our scheduled departure time, and we have been informed of yet another delay, pushing our departure to 3:00 AM on February 17, 2025.  The reasons for the delay have been inconsistent and vague, ranging from ""operational reasons"" to ""technical and safety"" concerns. This lack of transparency is unacceptable, especially when passengers are left stranded in the airport with no access to basic necessities. To add insult to injury, Air Transat took us back to a resort for 6 hours, only to force us back to the airport knowing full well they had no flight ready for us. Air Transat has blatantly violated the Air Passenger Protection Regulations which require airlines to provide meals, refreshments, and accommodations in the event of significant delays. Despite being legally obligated to care for passengers, Air Transat has done nothing to alleviate the suffering of those stranded.

Air Transat,airline,Dave Fowler,2025-01-14,The return flights were uneventful and on time but they had run out of onboard food purchase options except 1 breakfast sandwich for $9.49 by the time the cart reached Row 37. There were two beverage offerings on the flight to Cuba but only one on the way back. The scheduling of their flights to virtually coincide with those of Sunwing results in long lineups to get through security and inadequate space to accommodate all those waiting their turn for screening. My only other comment is related to AirTransat's relationships with the all-inclusive resorts on the cayos of the Atlantic side of Cuba. When we booked a 3 week vacation over Christmas and New Year's there was no warning that conditions following the two hurricanes in November were negatively impacting the quality of their all-inclusive offering.

Air Transat,airline,R Barton,2024-08-20,"We know Air Transat specs for carry on baggage are ridiculous compared to industry standards and nothing besides a tiny purse fits in their metal tester but at the same time, most experienced air Transat agents don't make a fuss out of it and understand that people who travel buy regular carry on size luggage not air transat size luggage for their trips. However what we found absolutely appalling is that it is subjective from agent to agent. So on our inbound Transat flight from Canada to Europe, we checked in our carry on free of charge as well as another 7 European flights on smaller planes but we got unlucky sucked into an unexperienced agent in Paris who made us pay 80 euros for a standard carry on luggage! Its a pure roberry. Either apply rules and make everyone pay (80 % of carry on luggages don't fit in the transat mold) but don't leave it in some subjective baffoon hands.",Negative,Positive
Air Transat,airline,M Ramírez,2024-07-31,"If you are thinking of flying from Europe to Canada, I would not recommend AirTransat. I flew from Barcelona to Calgary via Toronto. A month before the airline changed the initial connection from Montreal to Calgary. It scheduled my flight to arrive even later to my destination. When I arrived in Toronto, I had a layover of 5 hours and then my connecting flight to Calgary was CANCELLED. Nobody contacted me. Can you imagine the situation after having flown for nine hours and a layover of 5 hours? I spent the night at the airport and in the morning I try to contact the airline, (paying extra money to my phone company), but they were helpless on the phone saying that I had to contact the company which operated for them (PORTER). I filed a complaint for AirTransat without any answer 10 days so far... AFTER THREE DAYS my flight had been cancelled I received a message from Porter rescheduling my flight.... THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUED with my returning flight: I received a modification of my returning flights. Curiously enough, my flight from Calgary to Toronto had disappeared!!! And my flight now from Toronto to Barcelona had been delayed one day later! In the message AirTrans wrote that if I didn't accept this modification, I could ask for a refund filling a form. I try to fill that form and (surprise!) I couldn't! It said that I couldn't filling it because it was less than 24 hours before my leaving! (It's 31 July and the flight is on 6 Aug!!). I can understand that sometimes there are problems with flights, but this time it has been a record: 3 out of 4 have had cancellations and delays. Besides, the most important thing is to receive some kind of support or help from the company you paid for the tickets. Nothing of that I have received from Air Transat. I have had to pay more than $2,000 dollars in advance for their incompetent professionalism. Can you imagine this happening to you flying with children?",Negative,Positive

Our flight to Sydney was scheduled for April 14th and that only gave them 3 days to sort it out. We proceeded to have to come in every day, to their office in Port Vila as well as the airport to ask for the compensation that was clearly stated on their website. 7000 vatu a day per person for a maximum of 3 days. They didn’t want to honour this as they claimed the policy had changed but wasn’t updated yet on the website. After repeatedly showing up they finally accepted to pay for 2 days. In the end they weren’t able to bring our luggage over so we requested for it to be sent to Sydney as our terrible nightmare of a vacation was nearly over. However one day before departure they cancelled our flight. The one Boeing they use for international flights had mechanical problems. Customer service is horrendous, they’re unhelpful, hang up the phone and told us what’s the big deal? It’s only one extra day. The big deal was that our luggage was still not with us, imagine not having access to clean clothes for 4 days in a hot country. Do not book this airline.",Negative,Positive

At the airport you will need to pay an additional US$50 per person than if you fly using another airline. This is because Air Zimbabwe has not paid the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) the taxes for past passengers so now the CAAZ obtains these taxes directly from passengers as they are about to leave. If you fly BA or SAA, these taxes are included in the tickets. Also note that online ticket websites (we used GoToGate) do not publish the additional US$50 or any such information on their sites so that you purchase tickets through them only to receive a very nasty surprise at Harare airport.

We reached the Airport on time but because they didn't mention that the flight is in the newly launched terminal. We were late to reach the boarding gate but even though there was still time to board the flight, the crew didn't allow to board the flight. We knew this because when we where waiting to leave from the second terminal 15 minutes after not allowed entry another Airasia crew asked tried to help us to board the same flight 15 minutes after being denied entry.

The crew  worked very hard to try to insist that my 8 kg carryon would have to be checked at an exorbitant fee.  The flight remained on the tarmac for more than three hours before takeoff. No food or compensation was provided. When boarding, there was a period of 45 minutes with an advertising jingle for the airline. It is loud, repetitive, and abrasive. Crew were unwilling or unable to help me.  There is no means if contacting anyone if you experience issues. Customer support is a bot with limited ability to help. You will most likely not save any money taking this airline, even if it seems like you will from the ticket price.

AirAsia X,airline,K Putra,2024-12-01,"AirAsia is absolutely the worst airline I’ve ever dealt with. Our flight was delayed by more than three hours, which caused us to miss our connection, and the next available flight was scheduled for the following day. During check-in, we were told to “just approach the counter upon landing to discuss compensation.” However, upon arrival, there were no counters—none at all. It’s as if AirAsia simply doesn’t care about their customers. Attempts to contact them by phone were useless as calls went straight to voicemail. Their so-called “super-agent” askBo, an AI assistant, turned out to be completely pointless and incapable of answering even the simplest questions about compensation—it couldn’t understand basic queries, no matter how clearly phrased. AirAsia seems like the kind of airline that will completely abandon you in situations like this. You won’t be able to reach them via email, find them at the airport, or even speak to someone over the phone. I didn’t think airlines like this could even exist—ones that actively avoid any form of contact when their customers are in desperate need of help.

My baggage was completely destroyed by the airline handlers. I requested my compensation at the airport, and promptly I entered in contact with air Baltic with the details I received in the airport. I submitted my claim and received an automatic email that told me to go to the near repair shop, and this same repair shop was closed for “holidays”. I couldn’t repair my bag and after almost 15 days I got an answer from the Air Baltic customer service saying the exact same thing, that I should take my baggage to be repaired. However, the baggage can’t be repaired, since it’s destroyed. One wheel was completely removed from the luggage, other parts are completely damaged and another wheel it’s half broken. The luggage it’s unusable and after several emails, till the day of today, I received no answer from the Air Baltic customer service team. It’s a big shame!",Negative,Positive

airBaltic,airline,Michal Hubus,2024-09-12,"I recently experienced a significant delay with Air Baltic on a flight from Vienna to Riga that was delayed by over 5 hours, causing us to miss our connection and disrupt our entire travel plans. According to EU Regulation 261/2004, we are entitled to compensation since the delay exceeded 5 hours, and we chose not to board the delayed flight due to the impact on our schedule. Despite providing clear evidence of the delay and multiple attempts to assert our rights, Air Baltic has continuously denied our rightful claim for compensation. Their customer service team seems either unwilling or unable to correctly interpret the regulations, and their responses have been dismissive and unhelpful, referring us to dispute resolution bodies rather than addressing the issue directly. It is incredibly disappointing that a major airline would handle such a straightforward case in this manner. The refusal to comply with EU laws and the lack of proper customer service reflect poorly on Air Baltic. I would advise anyone flying with them to be prepared for similar issues, and if your flight is delayed, know that you might face a lengthy battle to receive the compensation you are legally entitled to. I am taking further steps to escalate this issue with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will not be flying with Air Baltic again unless they rectify this situation. Air Baltic, do better for your customers. Compliance with regulations and basic customer service should be a given, not a fight.",Negative,Positive

airblue,airline,Asad Iqbal Zafar,2023-11-23,"For 13 years, I was a devoted customer, always choosing Airblue for my travels between Dubai and Lahore. But after my last interaction, that loyalty has been utterly shattered. My recent booking involved a roundtrip flight from Dubai to Lahore and back. Everything seemed straightforward until I added a request for additional luggage to my booking. This is when I encountered the baffling, newly-revised policy that essentially forces passengers to pay for their seats again, even though they already paid for their tickets. How does this make sense? Why should a simple baggage request trigger a demand for payment for seats already purchased? Seeking clarification, I contacted customer service, only to be placed on a lengthy hold, treated to vague responses, and ultimately told I'd have to cough up an additional 1000 PKR if I even wanted to change my seats. The sheer audacity of this demand left me speechless. This is not about the money. It's about the blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and the utter lack of logic behind this policy. It's about losing trust in an airline I've flown with for over a decade, all for the sake of 1000 PKR. Well, Airblue, consider this a goodbye. You've lost a loyal customer, and I'm certain I'm not alone. Your apathetic approach to customer service and this nonsensical policy will undoubtedly drive away those who once valued your airline. I urge you to reconsider this change, prioritize your passengers, and remember that good customer service is not a luxury, but a necessity for a thriving airline.

If they could have called me to come and get my luggage, why did they not call me cause I was at the airport, checked in online at 8am, checked in a bag, and they still left me. It is because they don’t care, and now I will never get my R5000 back, lost ticket, lost time, lost gifts. When I emailed them to complain, they said they will get back to me after 2 months time.

AJet,airline,Marina Cherkasova,2025-02-14,"This is an incredibly unreliable company. I was travelling with my dog who was supposed to travel in the luggage compartment. We called AJet before the flight to book the place for the dog. We talked with the staff at the check-in counter at the airport and everything seemed fine. I paid for the pet transportation at the airport. It was when the boarding had started that they let me know that the crew refused to take my dog on board. Reason? The temperature of luggage compartment of the airplane can not be controlled by the crew. They couldn't tell me how it's possible that the luggage compartment is not suitable for pet transportation however it's possible to book a place there. And to pay for it! What's more, a second dog of ours had happily travelled by the same airline in the same plane just three weeks before! After some time of arguing the ground staff showed me a message from the crew that they refused to take the dog ""under any circumstance"". I had to fly so I left my dog in Almaty with my friends which was a tough decision. After I boarded the plane I found out that there was no place left for my cabin luggage as well as for the luggage of some other passengers. That's why some of the suitcases were taken from the cabin to the luggage compartment. It gave me a thought that maybe the real reason for not taking my pet onboard was the over-booking and excessive amount of luggage. We had to travel back to Kazakhstan to take my dog with another flight, the expenses we were totally not ready for. What's more, we haven't even received the refund from AJet. Problems that seem small compared to this but that should be mentioned: the airplane was packed, the air conditioning was poor making it really hard to breath which is quite a torture for the 5 hours flight. The food and drinks were available only for cash or credit cards and as I had a debit card I couldn't afford anything. But thankfully they gave me a free glass of water.

Due to weather issues the airline understandably cancelled our flight to Uyuni, upon learning that rebooking was not an option due to tour constraints we were assured we would be reimbursed and provided the link to give our information. That was June, and in November we still have not received the reimbursement much less any information about it.

We arrived at airport to find both legs had been cancelled and we were on different flight times which meant a complete change of plans and additional costs incurred. They claimed not to have contact details despite us proving we had provided these (as they had contacted us to confirm booking and provide tickets via email). Check in staff will also just shrug their shoulders and will not even provide an apology.

ANA All Nippon Airways,airline,D Petsas,2025-02-12,"I’ve flown ANA (NH) many times before in Business Class. The experience was always nothing short of superb. Premium Economy was slightly different. There’s no dedicated Premium Economy check-in lane. I’m Star Alliance Gold, so I was allowed to use the Business Class check-in line. Wait time was about 15 minutes. Ground staff was pleasant and courteous. Even if you are TSA Pre-Check, you’ll still need to take your laptop out of your bag. Nothing to do with the airline, but I think it’s a helpful piece of information to share. A very poor experience at the Horizon Lounge at JFK’s Terminal 7, which is a very bland facility. The men’s room was filthy. The food and beverage selection was basic. NH doesn’t run the lounge but a far cry and a planet apart from its lounge at HND. Seats 2-4-2 configuration. Comfortable seat, with generous recline and foot-rest. Ample-sized IFE screen and noise-canceling headphones. Avoid the window / middle seat : When your seat-mate has their foot-rest extended and the passenger in front of them has their seat in full recline, it’s impossible to jump over them, you need to wake them up and have them get up. My food was dismal in quality, selection, and presentation. The white wine served was an acidic mix, somewhere between grape juice from a box and vinegar, served in a tiny paper cup. Premium Economy gets the same meal service as Economy, which would be fine had the items served ex New York been edible and drinkable. Bathroom spartan, no tissue or hand towels in one them. Another had a clogged sink (which was fixed after a few hours). IFE  big monitor, small selections. Only four English-speaking films had CCs (I’m hearing impaired and it’s difficult to watch anything without subtitles). Great flight map, and the live camera feed is impressive. Announcements incomprehensible because of the low volume of the PA system. Could barely hear anything even with my hearing aids on.",Negative,Positive
ANA All Nippon Airways,airline,E Goyre,2024-10-23,"The service and comfort is correct and equivalent to other companies in Eco Premium. One advantage is the access to lounge. Food on board are same as eco and the only real difference is the seat a little bit more confortable. But don't imagine you will have a good night on a 12 hours flight. In fact you will have more privacy and much less chance of having an impolite person behind you that is shaking and hitting your seat.

However, we arrived about 20-30 minutes late and upon arrival, airport staff told me to go pick up my luggage (which took 1 hour to turn up) and head to Turkish Airlines' hotel desk. They put me up in a hotel and told me they'd rebooked on the same flight - 24 hours later! I arrived at my destination 24 hours late and AnadoluJet  are now denying me compensation on the basis that the delay was beyond their control - they are unsurprisingly doing everything they can to avoid providing me with evidence of that. It's worth noting the exact same thing happened on my way back though that time, I ended up spending 12 hours in the airport as they did not offer me a hotel room. Once again, they denied me compensation on the basis that the delay was beyond their control and continue ignoring my requests for evidence. Their customer service team is helpless and doing everything they can to avoid providing me with the information I requested.

Arajet,airline,C Halzna,2025-01-05,"In September, I booked round trip flights for 3 people from Toronto to Mexico City (with layovers in the Dominican), round trip Dec 23-Jan 15. On December 10, our return flight was cancelled, we were sent $100 apology vouchers to use on Arajet’s website that expired Dec 12. Soon after checking in at YYZ for our departing flight on December 23 (originally set to leave at 17:55) it was announced that we were delayed by two hours. We waited for our flight until 20:00. Then the flight was cancelled and we shuttled overnight to a hotel. No one would tell us when the flight would be rescheduled for. They only told us what time we would return to the airport that evening at 22:30, we had to be out the door by 3:00. We boarded a shuttle at 3:00 back to the YYZ and waited 5 hours in line to check in because the airline's computers were not working and they had to manually input each passengers information. The flight was then delayed again from the flights first scheduled departure time of 7:30, the plane actually only took off at 14:45. Our flight YYZ to PUJ landed at 18:45. Again, we were not told when we would return for our flight to NLU, we spent hours at the airport while they sorted out what to do with us without telling us when our flight was the next day. For a second time, this was confusing and frustrating. I took out $60CAD worth of local Dominican Pesos at the airport because I did not know how long we would be in the country and wanted to be as prepared as possible in these bizarre circumstances. Eventually, we were shuttled to another hotel, at the hotel they told us when the shuttle would depart for the airport. We took a shuttle from the hotel at 9:00 to the airport in the morning. They couldn’t find record of our boarding passes so we stood in line for hours again as they sorted that out. When we did get to check in, we were told by the airport Arajet rep that our bags were not acceptable and even though they had been checked at YYZ we needed to pay again to check them in. I have receipts and paid $43.99USD x 3 originally to have additional bags for this trip. The airport representative claimed that our fees only covered one leg of the flight and wanted to charge us again $150USD x3 for bags we checked in easily at YYZ and were originally going to meet us direct in Mexico City. For an hour I tried to show my receipts and explain we had already paid a fine for additional bags. Eventually, fearing we would be late (the Christmas airport lines were extremely daunting) for our 13:13 flight, we bit the bullet, payed the extra fines for the bags, and decided on fast check in for $89.20CAD to make sure we made our flight only to find out our flight again was delayed until 15:23. We landed around 20:30 on December 25 instead of 9:00 on December 24. We missed 35 hours of our vacation as well as our Christmas plans and spent an extra $838.81CAD just dealing with additional hurdles imposed by Arajet’s lack of communication. Arajet have not responded to my email detailing the above information. However on December 26 they sent us (3 travellers) a single Arajet coupon worth $20USD to use on their website, the coupon expired on Dec 25 (the day before we received the email).",Negative,Positive

Arik Air,airline,N Rossouw,2018-02-23,"My colleague and I were booked on an Arik Air flight from Lagos to Warri, supposed to depart at 07.40 in the morning. I received a message two days prior to the flight, informing me that ""due to operational requirements"" the flight will operate at 11.00. The morning of the flight, I received another message informing me that again ""due to operational requirements"" the flight will operate at 12.00. Once at the airport, waiting to board, we were informed the flight was delayed 20 minutes. Twenty minutes came and went and we eventually boarded and only took off at 13.00, arriving in Warri by 14.00, only getting to the hospital where we were to have 2 full days of work at 15.30. An entire day wasted by an incompetent airline. It does however get worse, it is now 2 days later and we are supposed to fly from Warri to Lagos, booked on the 09.20 flight. We have a connecting flight to Accra, Ghana at 17.10, so plenty of time to make this connection. Or so you think. I received a message from Arik 2 days ago informing me that ""due to operational"" requirements, the flight will now operate at 12.40. I'm still not too worried, as we will still make the connection. Don't hold your breath. I received another message from Arik this morning at 09.38 informing me that even this amended time has now changed to 16.40. So, to summarize - a flight supposed to have left at 09.20 has now been delayed and yet again delayed to 16.40. I phoned the Arik Air call centre, explained that I will now miss my connection to Ghana. She had absolutely no interest in my case, no offer of assistance. Her single line was ""Arik apologises"". I would not recommend this airline to anyone - despite selling tickets at certain times, they have clearly no intention of sticking to any schedule, making up flying times as it suits their ""operational requirements"".

Arkefly,airline,J de Graaff,2014-09-06,Flew Amsterdam - Aruba - Amsterdam (OR363 and OR 364) in July 2014. The outbound flight was on one of the old 767-300's a noticeably old and used aircraft (approx. 25 y/o). The seats in economy provide just enough legroom and you indeed have to pay for everything. Since the flight was only around €50 cheaper than the KLM alternative I would not recommend this one especially due to the old and noisy aircraft the charter flight customers (many crying children) and relatively inattentive crew. However the return flight was a brand new 787 Dreamliner aircraft in which I chose to fly Star Class. The difference is huge. The aircraft is quiet spacious and the seats and service in Star Class are much like Business Class with other premium airlines. You pay €270 for an upgrade which is decent value for money. All in all I would only fly Arkefly (long distance) again if it would be in the 787.,Negative,Positive

Austrian Airlines,airline,D Lane,2024-10-25,"In January 2024, we purchased roundtrip air tickets on Austrian Airlines (AA) from Dulles Airport outside DC to Vienna, Austria. We were supposed to fly to Vienna on April 29, 2024. The day before our flight, I received an email from AA announcing that our flight had been cancelled and AA would make alternative arrangements for us. I called AA quickly to make those arrangements. I made a new reservation for us on the same flight for the following day. I didn’t change our return flight in October. AA allows international passengers to check in two days before their flights. So, about 40 hours before our October return flight, I tried to check in. I tried numerous times but kept getting an error message. Our reservation appeared on my AA web account and on my AA App but I couldn't check in either on my laptop or on the AA App. I called AA’s customer service at least three times during the two days before our return flight. They informed me that AA was having technical difficulties with its computer systems and that we should arrive early to the Vienna airport to check in there. On the date of our return flight, we arrived at the Vienna airport about two hours and 40 minutes before our flight. We tried to check in at the self-service kiosk and an AA representative offered to help us. With her assistance, we tried to check in three times, all without success. She escorted us to the baggage service counter where she told us another representative would be able to help us. The woman at the baggage counter was able to find our reservation but not our tickets. She made some calls but was unsuccessful. After about fifteen minutes, she directed us to the Austrian Airlines ticket counter. We spent the next 70 minutes or so at the ticket counter working with three Austrian Airlines agents, one of whom was the manager. The first woman also said she found our reservation but not our tickets. She said she couldn’t give us our boarding passes without our tickets. Her first solution was for us to purchase one-way tickets to Washington DC. I told her that was ridiculous; that we had already paid for roundtrip tickets and would not pay for more tickets. She said that when Austrian Airlines rebooked us in April on our flight to Vienna, AA had cancelled our return flight and had given us refunds of $66.90 each to convert our two round trip tickets to one-way tickets. I scoured my credit card statements and I found the Austrian Airlines refunds in my June statement. However, I never received an email from Austrian Airlines notifying me of a refund for a roundtrip to a slightly less expensive one-way trip. And, because AA had downgraded us from premium economy to regular economy from our cancelled to our rebooked flight in April, I thought any refund was to compensate for that downgrade. The manager of the ticket office was the only Austrian Airlines representative who actually listened to me. She agreed that it made no sense for our allegedly cancelled reservation to remain on my AA web account and on my AA App. She had added that we had done nothing wrong. The manager told us that this was the only time in her 23 years at Austrian Airlines that this had happened to any passengers. She told us she would figure out how to fix it. It took her another 20 minutes or so but she finally called us over to collect our return flight tickets to DC. She said she was unable to seat us together.",Negative,Positive

Called to change my return from Budapest to go out of Prague and was told they had to do something in their system to ""unmarry"" the flights and call back in 24 hours. 2 months later, 16 phone calls and over 20 hours they finally unmarried the flights. Since it took so long, and the flight I wanted from Prague was nearly sold out, I bought two tickets thinking once they unmarried and reconnected the flights I would get reimbursed since I'd already purchased a full price fair from Budapest. The airline refuses to A. speak with me on the phone (though I've been told five times I would get a call back, I never have) and B. refuses to refund any portion of the added flight I had to book because of their incompetence.

Austrian Airlines,airline,I Ho,2024-09-04,"My flight took off late from PVG and left me with only one hour of transit time at VIE. However, the VIE-AMS flight was also delayed (by about 1-1/2 hour), and thus allowing me ample time to catching this second leg and even using the lounge. Nevertheless, my checked luggage did not make it on the delayed flight (OS375) from VIE to AMS and was put on a later flight. Though the whole incident was not reported to me either at the gate or via the active APP on my phone. Upon arrival at AMS, I waited for more than an hour before reaching their service partner (i.e. dnata) inquiring about my checked luggage and it was then reviewed to me that the luggage was delayed. Not acceptable. The original flight was to arrive in AMS at 7:15pm, and after the luggage fiasco, I didn't leave the airport until well after 10:15~10:30pm. Not one word of apology was uttered by the ground service agent nor the airline even though I am a Star Alliance Premier Gold member. I cannot accept this as a way to treating a frequent flyer. Furthermore, enroute PVG-VIE, service on board was minimal. I rang the service call bell for 20-minutes (turning it ON and OFF a few times) to ask for a bottle of water for my medication. Not answered. I wouldn't even want to imagine what if I was having medical emergency. Scary thought. Food served for Premium Economy was mediocre at best. The friend rice (if you could call it that) lacked substance, taste, flavor and simply cheap-food.",Negative,Positive

We were informed at 1pm our flight was delayed 24 hours and was told they would cover the hotel cost for another night. This wasn't the best option, and I had a very important meeting for work to attend but it would be way cheaper then booking another flight on another airline. We went to the airport 3 hours early because we didn't have anything else to do and when it was time to board we went to the departing gate. When we arrived the airline at that gate wasn't the correct one and we were told to go down to another one. When we got there, there was no one at the counter but I was able to flag down a crew member in the boarding area. They told us the flight was canceled and they couldn't do anything for us, the plane was still parked and ended up leaving while I was on hold with customer service. They refunded my flight cost and I ended up booking with another airline at twice the price and had to fly back to an airport 1 hour away.

The flight down was as smooth as one could expect from a low cost airline. The return was an entirely different story - after repeated delays regarding a maintenance issue, we were told a plane would be arriving by 6pm from Florida to take us back. We saw the crew leave and the plane towed and no replacement flight. Text message received at 6:59pm from Avelo to all passengers stating ""Unfortunately, we will not be able to re-crew your flight...flight has been delayed until tomorrow 07/25/2024 at 6:30 AM."" The desk agent was nowhere to be found to provide additional details. We had been offered a $15 meal credit per person earlier - nearly impossible to find anything at the airport for $15, Then another text stating ""Please submit receipts for any reasonable expenses to[email protected]. Avelo will reimburse you for up to $150 per reservation for a hotel tonight."" I quickly found the cheapest hotel in proximity to the airport for just over $300. Everyone on the flight of almost 200 passengers were scrambling to find hotel rooms. The next morning the flight took off - never an apology for the delay. The flight staff never circulated in the cabin and never offered a drop of water or signature bag of plantain chips - nothing. One passenger told us he had gone to the galley to get water and the crew was sleeping. Once home, I dutifully submitted my reasonable expenses for hotel, uber rides and meal for my SO and myself. I was reimbursed less than 1/2 of out of pocket cost for the delay. Customer service, upon inquiry, informed me that hotel was only authorized for up to $150 per reservation. I penned a letter to the CEO, Andrew Levy, to voice my complaint and request reimbursement for all expenses. No response. So, I do not recommend Avelo, not only did they jerk us around all afternoon we expected to fly, they inconvenienced everyone with the incredibly delayed flight and refused to fully reimburse for passenger expenses as a result of their issue.",Negative,Positive

I was set to return Sunday, July 21, 2023. I arrived to the airport at 10:30 am (confirmation #YWL6PP). I didn't have any bags besides a carry on and car seat for my 1 yr old traveling with me. The Avelo Staff moves very slow and are very unhelpful. Went through the TSA pre check then off with my shoes and bag threw the scanner. At that moment the computer or scanner went down. No one apologized and no even explained what was happening.  No type of urgency or care in the world. Everyone walking around unsure of their job description. Which held up me for a good while. Well, to my dismay the flight took off without! And I wasn't the only one at least 6 people were in my position. Feeling very upset and discouraged. I call customer to see if they could help me with getting the next flight. I apologize I didn't get a name. Yet, this woman was very rude and mean. She made me feel even worst on what turned out to be a bad day. No help at all. Telling me I was a no show so there is nothing she could do and this is literally right after I missed the flight. And she practically told me it was my fault be there 2hrs ahead. Then hanging up. So I went back to a family members home. Had to make my next move the best move. So after I searched for another flight leaving that night and I had no luck. Then purchased a ticket for Monday. Arrived very early so I wouldn't miss another flight. Once more made I asked about the car seat I was instructed to Gate Check it. There was nothing placed on the car seat but a purple tag with my last name and flight number. So I make it through TSA precheck. Place bag on scanner belt. At this point I'm being advised that I would be searched cause powder was found in my daughters car seat. Yet, couldn't be sure what the substance. Now, I'm being searched in front of everyone as if I'm a criminal.  Then I get my stuff proceed to Gate 2. I was then advised leave my car seat at the bottom of the ramp. I gave it to a Airport Employee. I boarded my flight. I arrive in Atlanta as I exit the plane I see a man with another flyers stroller at that I asked about my car seat I was told pick it up at baggage claim. Walk all the way to baggage claim and my car seat never comes. Then walk over to over sized looking for my car seat and nothing. I walk to the Avelo counter and no one is there to aid me in the loss of my car seat. At this point I feel broken and really disappointed with Avelo in a whole. I really don't ever want to fly with you again. So I call customer and I am advised on what to do. I am woman flying with a 1 yr old child.

Avianca,airline,Brian Hills,2025-02-15,"If you thought that Spirit Airlines was the worst, it is only because you have not taken a ride with Avianca. If you are in the mood to inflict some form of self-hate, I would suggest engaging with Avianca. If you feel that you need to punish yourself for some reason, please engage with Avianca. If there is someone that you would like to play and April fool's joke on this year OR if there is a person that you authentically HATE, offer to buy them a flight somewhere and buy the ticket with Avianca. Avianca is masquerading as an airline. I purchased a ticket with them, as I have for many tickets going to different countries on many different airlines. I book my tickets months in advance going from country to country. When I booked a ticket going from Brazil to Spain I was given a quote. I agreed to pay the price, (I live in the US, and I was making the reservation on my computer in the US). It then changes from US dollars to Brazilian real. When they changed it to the Brazilian real, they changed the price, (which I had no knowledge of). I only discovered that they charged me more after I was checking something else on my online bank statement. I called them to ask about it. The payment was still being processed. I was told because the point of departure was Brazil, they had to convert my US dollar to the Brazilian real and I incurred a currency exchange. I informed them in all my years of traveling and using many different airlines, but also, if that is a policy of theirs there should be a disclaimer that states that possible fees maybe incurred on international flights for various reasons, please see our policies. There was nothing to that affect anywhere on their website. I explained that to them, they said we are sorry that is something I have to take up with my bank. My bank informed me that charge did not come from them if came from Avianca. Another situation, I was supposed to go from Rio in Brazil to Paris, France. My flight was at 1:24am. When I got to the airport to check-in at Avianca there was no one at the desk to check-in with. I checked in with the kiosk, it told me to see an agent, again, there was no agent present. My flight left, I had to stay in Brazil, I lost the money for that flight, lost the money for the hotel in Paris, and lost the money for the flight back to the US. When I called Avianca the agent was beyond rude and uncaring about my situation. He lied throughout the call and refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor, when I asked multiple times, plus he did not allow me to take the survey that I was supposed to take to rate his service. I had to speak to four other agents between five days just to get to a point of filing a complaint, and Avianca has still done nothing, in both cases.

There was an issue over whether we had paid for hold baggage; the picture suggests that we did but, after detailed investigation, it does look as if we did not. However, the staff were incompetent beyond belief: the so-called manager insisted on some sort of number as part of the evidence that we had paid for bags but the airport had no Wifi and we had problems using 3G/4G data. At no point did anybody suggest that we could pay for the luggage and sort out the problem afterwards, something I would have been happy to do. If I had not taken the initiative in suggesting this, we would have missed our flight. One of this ""manager's"" charmless colleagues had the cheek to castigate us for not being able to speak Portuguese at an international airport check-in! Between us, we speak English, Spanish and French but it was apparently OUR fault that the Brazilian education system is woefully inadequate when it comes to foreign languages. Once on board, 30 minutes after take-off, the trolley finally made an appearance.

Avior Airlines,airline,Thomas Hilbert,2014-04-02,I often fly PMV-BLA-MIA on 9V mostly in Business Class 4-5 times a year. Overall performance has improved a lot compared to 2012 when delays of 2-3 hrs were common. They now use ex-US Airways B-737-400 for their international routes including Miami and Panama-Tocumen. FA's are average or above depends on the crew you got on your specific flight. Food in Business Class is below average but you can eat it. Drink service is way below average only soft drinks and water offered in Business Class. On return flight MIA-BLA they give you Whisky no wine no sparkling water nothing. Check-in in PMV takes an hour or so since they fill out the passenger list for MIA manually. Transit in BLA is quite easy no long walking distances BUT broken escalators for over a year now disgusting. On your return flight you have to claim your luggage in BLA what is kind of funny since there is no luggage belt. Suitcases are thrown through a hole in the wall into bag claim hall. Seating in business class is fairly comfortable (old US domestic first class) in coach very narrow seats low pitch uncomfortable for flights 1 hr or more. No inflight entertainment. Safety briefing in both Spanish and English. Because fares are much lower than on AA or Delta it s my first choice to the US. And when originating in PMV you don t have to go through Maiquetia which is a mess and waste of time.,Negative,Positive
Avior Airlines,airline,Norbert Meyers,2005-08-07,Trinidad W.I. POS to Isla Margarita (Polarmar). Check in was very convenient at POS Terminal. Avior opened 3 Counter for approx 120 Passenger. All Pax checked in approx in 25 Min. The Aircraft arrived only 20 Minutes delayed because of bad weather. On board the service was above my expectations. Even on this short flight of 45 Min they served a snack and 2 times softdrinks. Avior leased the aircraft with business and econ. configuration but offers only eco class. The AC an older B737-200 was in quite good conditions and boading the AC we had the chance to see into the cargo/baggage holds and got a positive impression. Only situation worries me was the lack of language skills of the cabin crew. During the demonstration of the safety features the lady showed the use of the life vests and the only english skills attendant explained same time the oxygen masks. We believed that she had no clou what her co worker was talking about. Most of the passengers had lots of fun during the bad safety demo but I thought what happens in a case of emergency? Most of the passenger from Trinidad have no spanish skills and wouldnt be able to understand the instructions from the FAs. Returning from Margarita we were shocked seeing the chaotic situation at the Airport. No real information how the system runs. Endless waiting infront of several check points and finally we arrived at the departure gates. Same time Avior departed to POS and SATA to Martinique. No correct information what line is the correct one. At the end they just let all passenger thru and we had to find our way to the AC on our own. No Ground Staff to guide the passenger on the runfield. Finally we departed 1 hr late due to bad co ordination of ground staff and had a quite flight back to Trinidad W.I.

Azur Air Germany,airline,H Meisteran,2018-07-11,"Palma to Dusseldorfv. Azur Air Germany is a newcomer on the German market aiming for the very low-budget tourist niche. Passengers were mostly low-budget party travellers. Their sole B739 aircraft was purchased from Lion Air. Overall I got a poor impression of the airline's services and quality. The airline lacks professionality and reliability in many ways: - only paper-tickets, check-in at the airport only, no seat selection - three busses bring passengers to the plane at one time due to some special procedure are only some rows are allowed to board fist. Most have to wait on the apron, some passengers start smoking - check-in should open 3 hrs before the flight, but opens 2 hrs before the flight, long queues, waiting time > 45 mins - delay of more than 2 hrs - plane arrived on time, departure delayed for an unknown reason (even for their own cabin crew), delays were just shown on screens; no notification prior to the flight. Handling agent at the airport refuses any vouchers for refreshments and to issue a paper stating the reason for the delay (breaking European regulations) . Cabin on B739 in used shape with a very tight seat pitch, which varies from row to row. Hot meals are on purchase only and of average quality, the meals listed in the menu aren't available, they serve other meals instead. Azur Air only accepts cash payments in Euros aboard and refuses to issue receipts for these cash payments (meals, drinks and inflight shopping). Cabin crew is a mix of experienced and new flight attendants, they don't have visible standards or procedures which makes it look unprofessional in several ways - some crew members seem customer-oriented, but suffer from the low quality of the airline's organisation and equipment. Staff is quite unpersonal not introducing themselves in the announcements and using a harsh tone overall (they seem to be annoyed by their low-budget clientele). So if you have a choice, I'd highly recommend not to take Azur Air. Their reliability and professionality are way below average and can't compete with other low-budget charter carriers.",Negative,Positive

We asked to rebook our return flight for a day later due to the loss of our day because of the severely delayed departure. We were told it was no problem and given 4 new seats on a return for a day later to make up for the lost day at airport. After our wonderful vacation in Nassau, we arrived to airport 2.5 hours early for our ticketed flights only to find out we were booked on a full flight and had to be on standby, with no other departing flights for that day. We were stuck and had connections that would be impacted if we didn't get to Florida that day. So, after 1.5 hours of waiting for a customer service rep to try to bump other passengers, we were told we would not be departing that day. We were forced to purchase $1400 one way tickets on another carrier just to get to our other connections. The staff at Orlando who overbooked us on a full flight should be fired.

So, we get on the flight and told no its not available. My husband could not eat anything that was available on the plane. Considering the price we paid, we deserved to get the flight we were promised and were not.

Beijing Capital Airlines,airline,Sophia Chong,2015-10-08,"Departed from Singapore and arrived in Beijing on 01 August 2015 at 1440hrs. To avoid missing the Beijing Capital Airlines flight as planned to depart at 2110hrs the same day, we went to the Information Counter at Beijing Capital International Airport to confirm the terminal for boarding. We were only aware and informed that the flight has been cancelled upon checking at the Information Counter. From the flight booking details, it was clearly stated one of my company’s contact number and email. However, the airline did not ensure that we were informed of the flight cancellation. After checking at the Information Counter, a phone call was made to Beijing Capital Airlines to re-confirm the cancellation of the flight and to find out why we were not being informed. No answer was given. In view of our original arrangement in Hulunbuir, we also check with the Beijing Capital Airlines on the next earliest available flight to Hailar. However, all flights to Hailar was fully booked due to peak season. And we were informed by the airline that the earliest available flight was on 05 August which affected our original plan greatly. To minimize the delay to Hulunbuir, we have no choice but to source for alternative flight from another airline, having the earliest available flight on 04 August. According to our conversation with Beijing Capital Airlines's operator, the airline was able to refund our tickets. After made a request of the Flight Delayed Certificate and ultimately we received it after we come back from our trip. Reason stated in their certificate is cancelled due to aircraft adjustment. We were required to write-in to request to claim of our refund and follow-up by some other procedures. However until to-date, we are yet to received a reply from the airline. We find no other way to make our request and was like being ignored. No follow-up action by the airline. I hope someone able to assist on the matters.",Negative,Positive

Bhutan Airlines,airline,N Bayasa,2024-05-16,"Nice aircraft and good inflight service. Good food and efficient, courteous cabin crew on both sectors. However I had a stressful checkin experience on the return flight (Kolkata to Bangkok). My checkin bag weighed 23 kg, so it was 3 kg extra, which usually is overlooked. However the checkin gentleman wanted to prove his super-efficiency and he asked me to put my hand bag also together with my checkin bag. He then went a step further and forced me to put a paper-bag with food also on the weighing scales. Then he declared that the total weight is 35 kilos, and you're allowed only 20+7 kilos, so you have to pay for the extra 8 kilos. This is ridiculous, in my 30+ years of international travel with premier and budget airlines, nowhere have the checkin bags been weighed together with all hand bags, and even food packets. I was singled out by the staff, I saw that they did not weigh the hand bags for the other passengers with me. True the bags were a bit extra in weight but if they weighed just my hand bag it would be 8 kilos, just a kilo extra, which could be excused. But this extra-zealous guy was out to fleece me. He even made me stand apart and asked me to get rid of the extra weight or pay up. It was so humiliating and stressful. Later I was forced to throw away some rice packets and then they allowed me to checkin. The funny part is that they have no system of pre-purchase baggage like all other airlines, so you're forced to pay the inflated airport rate; that is not fair policy. I had called up their helpline a few weeks before to check for purchase of excess baggage but they refused. I will never fly their airline again, inspite of the fact that the food service and cabin service was good. I have also advised all my friends to avoid this airline.",Negative,Positive

In the afternoon at check-in we were told the flight was delayed a further 1.5 hrs. We had a 7.5 hr delay with no apologies. This also guaranteed we would miss our flights back to Australia. We booked another flight at our own expense to get us to Istanbul on time and Blu Air couldn't get our baggage off their flight in time. 2 hrs and no sign of the luggage so in the end we checked in to our other flight and fly home without our bags.

Since the airline never updated we had no idea whether we could leave the gate to get refreshments. To add insult to injury the only company representative kept telling lies we were told several times that the plane was on the ground but since as the airport was busy there was no bus to pick us up.

EU regulations imply that a refund or a free change should be offered, but that won't appear anywhere in the email they send you (which essentially reads ""it is what it is, suck it up""). Thirdly, and the true cherry on top, some of the reserved seats we bought in order to travel together had to be bought again, as the child in our party was moved far from her parents for no good reason at all once the departure airport was changed. There is no customer support. Two requests to at least reimburse the same seats we had to needlessly buy for a second time and not cheaply, were systematically ignored. Ludicrous, they shouldn't be allowed to operate. Basically TAROM flies to all BlueAir destinations and these days their fares are comparable - and when you add up all the inconveniences, not only will you be happier with TAROM but also quite likely with more cash in your wallet.

Blue Islands,airline,S Morten,2022-02-20,"I was on the 09:00 SI 2258 flight to BHX from Jersey on 01/12/21. There was a technical fault and we had to turn around. This flight was then cancelled and I collected my luggage with no instruction as to what to do next. So I called Blue Islands and spoke to a representative who said the best she could do was put me on another flight SI 5554 to East Midlands due to leave at 14:10, but this was further delayed until 15:25. I landed at East Midlands at approximately 16:40. I then had to get a taxi to Birmingham airport costing me £89.22 meaning I did not get back to my car until around 19:00. I was given the impression by the representative that I would be eligible for some compensation to cover my extra expenses and time and that I should keep my receipts. That did not turn out to be the case. As Blue Islands operate outside of EU regulations I was not eligible for any compensation as per their terms and conditions. I double checked this a they were technically correct so I asked if it would be possible to have my taxi fee refunded at least as none of this was my fault. This was refused and simply said I should take it up with my travel insurance. It is neither their or my fault that I am out of pocket. I've never known such poor customer service from a company.

All we asked was that Breeze credit our ticket cost for the $105.00. There is no number to call them to explain so all communication is done through text.

British Airways,airline,E Vandoon,2025-02-18,"I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied.

I asked a few days before the flight if it was going to happen they said yes. It was cancelled and they offered my money back or to reschedule the flight for the 05/02/2022 to which I said yes re-schedule it. I receive an email with my ticket. On the day of the flight they said I was in the system but not on the plane - after which they told me to go and ask a help desk located in the airport. They said i cannot board the plane, and that the only way for me to fly on the day is to buy a new ticket, and the money to the newly bought ticket would be returned. I sent e-mails pictures of boarding passes and they said it would take them 2 months to process my issue. 10 months later I did not receive any answer so I emailed them. They returned the money for the first flight which was 150lev cheaper. The money I got refunded was not even the full amount! People are struggling to make ends meet and they don’t even bother to fix your issue and in the end they return not even the full amount of money. Absolutely unbelievable!

Bulgaria Air,airline,N Kaltin,2021-03-08,"When lockdowns started because of corona in March 2020 in South America, I was stuck in Peru. After 30 days of waiting for rescue flight back to Europe, finally I was able to go home. Rescue flight was operated by British Airways and they flew from Lima to London. Since I can't enter UK without visa, I had to buy ticket out of London asap as I land. There were no flights on the same day, but there was a flight on the next one operating by Bulgaria Air from London to Sofia. I purchased that ticket. I was about to wait 24 hours at the airport and I was fine with it. Meanwhile, Bulgaria Air canceled that flight and rescheduled for the next day. That was not fine for me as I can't spend 2 days at the airport waiting for the flight. I purchased another, more expensive flight through different city and went back home. It's almost a year and Bulgaria Air still didn't refund me my money. I tried to explain them that since they didn't operate the flight I purchased ticket for, they have no rights to keep my money. They give me some lame explanations that it takes them longer time to return money or that I can reschedule that ticket for another flight.

A sign was written on a piece of paper - this was the only notice the airline provided. No other details. No arrangements were made for the delay - no food, no water no accommodation etc. Absolutely ridiculous. The aircraft finally arrived at 3:10 am. It did not depart till 4:30am - a full 10 hours after the scheduled departure time. The reason for the delay was not notified to the passengers. We were made to board the aircraft and just sit inside, while there was a huge commotion going on in the cockpit. Apparently the pilots refused to take off as they had ended their shifts. The flight only took off after the police were called and there were physical altercations with the pilots. What a joke of an airline.

Then on a check-in the employee could not find my entry and it took him ~20 mins and several calls to get things sorted out (most likely i was not in 8 am registry list still, as i bought ticket to 12 pm flight initially and someone forgot to update that list), which almost made me late for the flight - got in on final call. Turned out there is no assigned seats at all, so active fast running teenagers occupied all window seats. Then I've put my e-book Kindle into seat pocket and forgot it there, contacted the airline 5 hours later after the flight via e-mail saying that i am still around to pick it up, two days later received a reply ""sorry, not found anything"" - impossible as I was the last leaving the jet and i am 100% positive about leaving my device in the pocket.

I was on my way to catch a Swiss Air flight from Boston to a 26-day trip to Europe, with 4 Airbnbs, 3 car rentals, and 6 international flights lined up and paid for! Yet Cape Air messaged me an hour and a half before the flight about cancelation due to a ground stop. In that message, they said they should try to secure ground transportation to Boston, but that did not happen. Apparently, other passengers called and said they found other alternatives. I was busy packing and not looking at my phone. They did not care about ruining my trip to Europe, where I was supposed to meet my son. I planned and saved for this trip for a year. I had to drive from Rutland to Boston to catch my flight and I had no choice but to park at the Logan Airport. Now, Cape Air is refusing to reimburse me for the cost of parking. And I think that is the least they can do after screwing me up. Their cancellation rate is way up. They are totally unreliable for anything but sightseeing. They are uncompassionate and irresponsible for not providing alternative transportation. And they are not trustworthy for saying they would and then not do it.

Cathay Pacific Airways,airline,1 reviewsN Mayle,2025-02-27,"I am posting this on behalf of my traveling companion, who experienced Cathay Pacific’s baggage claim process. Their approach to handling claims is frustrating, lacks transparency, and shifts responsibility onto passengers. On January 27, 2025, she flew on CX561 from Osaka Kansai to Hong Kong and discovered that her checked baggage was damaged upon arrival. Due to traveling with children, she was unable to report it immediately at the airport but submitted her claim within CX’s 7-day policy window.  Initially, CX refused to acknowledge the claim, stating it should have been reported at the airport. After multiple follow-ups, they finally accepted it but continued to delay resolution. They insisted on a purchase receipt, despite the luggage being a trade-in with no direct receipt available. CX based their offer on a depreciated “trade-in” value instead of a fair replacement cost. Depreciation was applied without explanation, and CX failed to clarify their calculation method.  It appears CX lowballs compensation offers, hoping passengers will accept without question. When my companion first submitted the claim, no ID or Letter of Authorization (LOA) was required—which made sense, since she was handling it personally.  However, after I followed up on her behalf, CX suddenly required an LOA and ID—but only after I requested an escalation. Instead of fairly assessing the claim, CX made the passenger do all the work. CX should have its own reference pricing for standard luggage brands instead of making customers research on their own. Despite multiple attempts to settle this fairly, CX has failed to provide a transparent resolution.",Negative,Positive

I had to wait for several families with children to board first since I was told children are a priority over disabled passengers without wheelchairs. This airline will only recognize disabled passengers if you are in a wheelchair which is ridiculous.

Cebu Pacific,airline,Byron Bontia,2025-01-26,"This is an open letter from a long time Cebu Pacific Passenger both domestically and internationally flying with Cebu Pacific for the last 15 years. I address this letter in complete and utter exhaustion and disdain after numerous years of continued delays of incompetence and complete lack of professionalism and organisation but this is officially the last straw. As both an Australian-Filipino passenger I am completely disgusted by the severe lack of care this airline has for it’s passengers and it’s cheap budget airline tactics to either A) Make you pay for basic needs such as food and water (Particularly on long 8 hour flights) or B) Use evasive tactics for you to re-book or fail to make your flight. Speaking as both a Filipino and Foreigner are we not all tired and embarrassed of this airline’s repeated failure to be a good representation of our culture. I could go through a series of numerous blunders by the airline like the purposeful timing of exactly 12 midnight to confuse passengers about the date in which they fly out so they can make more money in rebookings or how about the continuous delays we all know too well. But on this occassion that broke me was an important transfer from Cebu to Manila to our international flight to Sydney. There were approximately 20 passengers in total with connecting flights, some solo travellers, some with young children and some with elderly parents such as myself. Not only did we already have 3 hours to get to the Gate but they reduced that time by 15 minutes by holding our luggage hostage for their own “ease of care” or shall I say another rebooking tactic in order to claim their “no show” policy. Not only were we refused to get our own luggage but some passengers were even misinformed to retrieve their own luggage confusing us passengers more. Moreover once waiting patiently for the luggage above as directed in Terminal 3 (after being told it would only take 30 minutes) we ended up waiting til 15 minutes before our boarding time with their excuse saying we have to “check the luggage” after once again having to check our luggage anyway for check in as per international Australian protocols (which we understand). Once we received our luggage however we were shocked to find our luggage had been aggressively mishandled and broken. Where the main issued lied was their refusal to provide us our boarding passes which in turn would render us vulnerable to having to rebook as there is no liable evidence that we had checked into our flight which as you guessed it makes us liable to their “no show” policy. In short we were at the mercy of the airline with our literal luggage basically being held hostage for ransom (rebooking flight fees). So this message is a warning to all prospective passengers particularly those with elderly family members and children; do not fly with Cebu Pacific. Are we not tired of an airline that reinforces negative stereotypes. Are we not tired of being swindled and mistreated while this company makes profit off underhanded and evasive tactics?

Firstly, their webpage was not allowing anybody to book for a few days, even from here in the Philippines. However I was easily able to book a flight on the GotoGate website. I wanted to visit my daughter, which is only a 45 minute flight on an ATR72. Literally the day after I was booked I was advised that I would not be able to get my return flight. No reasons given, it was just assumed that I would be happy with a flight the next day. Whilst this may sound reasonable, some of us have to work, and at this time I have very limited free time available to me to travel and see my daughter. I'm sick to death of airlines being able to hide behind poor excuses. I am ex airline / aviation industry myself. Am I to believe that an airline as big as this has no contingency planning? No standby aircraft available if one goes U/S? I won't accept that. Don't waste your time or money, find an alternative.

China Airlines,airline,B Thornton,2024-06-04,"Horrific customer experience after being left in the queue by the airline. We arrived at Taoyuan Airport in Taiwan to check into our flight back to London 2 hours before departure. The airport was extremely busy and, in each section, it was nearly impossible to move between the lines of passengers zig-zagging away from the check-in desks and up the corridor. Our own set of check-in counters (Area 11) appeared to be handling 8 flights, most of which were departing at around the same time. We managed to reach the check-in desk around 7:30am (30 mins before departure) and was told that the flight was closed and we could not check in. During that time, nobody went past us with a sign, changed the signs over the check in counters or called our flight loud enough to hear, and there were no staff members available to speak to. We were aware of the time, so we were looking for staff holding signs; neither of us left the line or wore headphones as we were trying to be vigilant. There was nothing to suggest we should just stay in line with everyone else. At the customer support desk, the supervisor (Chang YuHao) tried to help by suggesting he could put us on the Monday flight (2 days later). However, there was no offer to cover our costs (two nights accommodation in a hotel (plus expenses)) and it would mean missing a day of work and my wife’s pregnancy scan. He then suggested that he would speak to the duty manager to see if there were any other solutions. When the duty manager (Liao ChiaRu) arrived at 9:30 am (nearly 1.5 hours after we arrived at the support desk), he refused to offer any solution. He claimed he had made the announcement himself, but we never saw him (in connection with our flight or others). He acknowledged that his voice might not have been loud enough (to which we pointed out the need to use a microphone or the screens at the counter to display messages on such a busy day. Where the supervisor had tried to find a solution, the duty manager made clear that it was our fault that we were stuck in the line at the counter. When I told him that my wife was pregnant and needed to get home, he laughed at me and then walked away and we never saw him again. To be clear, my wife is Taiwanese and spoke Mandarin to him, so there was no miscommunication. The supervisor then discussed alternatives with him in the back room and told us that the duty manager had refused to move us onto another flight and left us with the choice of (a) flying out two days later, or (b) cancelling the flight and finding an alternative (with a fee of £181 per person applied as a late cancellation fee). This was clearly not helpful as either option would cost us a fortune and we had not done anything wrong. In the end, we spent £1200 to get a Thai Airways flight home. This is an appalling way to treat customers who have complied with their obligations and no way to act as an airline.",Positive,Negative

China United Airlines,airline,5 reviewsS Liu,2021-02-05,"The reason for taking China United Airlines this time is that the ticket price is cheap（For the air tickets between Beijing and Shanghai, the prices of other airlines are more than 1000 yuan. Only China United Airlines is 535 yuan). Because it is a low-cost airline, there is no free checked luggage. The staff at the ground counter have a very good attitude and high efficiency. There is almost no queuing phenomenon. China United Airlines has only 737 aircraft, and it has a full economy class layout. Compared with other low-cost airlines, everyone of China United Airlines has sent a bottle of water, which is good. I bought the meal through the app in advance, but it was obviously not so delicious and affordable. The seat can't be adjusted. There is no entertainment system, no small TV, no WiFi in the whole cabin, which is very bad.",Negative,Positive

Citilink,airline,D Green,2024-08-09,"I was not able to check in online before the flight, apparently this doesn't exist for their international routes. So I couldn't pick the seat, but more importantly, I couldn't add any extra baggage- I knew I was going to be a bit over, so prepared to pre-pay. At the check in desk, was refused a bag to go at my feet, when I protested I was told ""its a very busy flight"". I was made to repack twice and eventually charged an extortionate fee to check an extra bag- when I questioned if this was more expensive than if I had booked prior, I was told it was. But how was I supposed to book extra baggage, when I can't check in beforehand? Apparently, you can go online in a period of time before just for this- not clear at all. And that ""very busy flight""? A spare seat next to me, a spare seat in the row in front, and the three seats on the other side of the aisle a spare seat. I've been fortunate to fly with multiple airlines through south east Asia the past few months, and never had an experience as bad as this one.",Negative,Positive
Citilink,airline,J Smart,2024-04-13,"I thought Citilink was a cut above most Indonesian airlines. Sadly not. Our flight was due to depart at 3.45pm; we received an email the day prior to departure saying the flight departure was changed to 7.30pm. Then a Citilink agent rang and asked if we accepted the changes. We had no choice as all other options at this late stage were fully booked out (it was Eid). Then on the day of the flight (today) we received another email saying the flight was delayed until 9.10pm, a delay of 5 hours 15. My wife is pregnant and this meant staying at the airport for hours on end. At one point, I asked about a meal voucher but a Citilink agent said the flight was not delayed. I showed her the evidence to the contrary but she would not accept the delay. Then, as a final insult, as we sit here at Bali airport, the flight has been delayed a further one hour. No meal voucher, no snack, no drink, no offer of compensation. This is Citilink. Never again will I fly with this low-quality airline.",Negative,Positive
CityJet,airline,E Chalini,2018-07-18,"London City to Florence. I am utterly appalled by this airline. Not only were we diverted mid-flight from Florence to Pisa because of a technical fault (we were delayed in take off also by a technical fault - unclear if it was the same one, but the aircraft was rather old and shabby, and the toilet stunk to high heaven). Most egregiously, about 20 passengers did not have their bags loaded on to the aircraft. I received no information or apology from the airline about this. Some passengers seemed to have received a text letting them know of the issue, with a brief apology and no explanation. We were provided with a bus to Florence Airport where we were told to file a baggage claim (since CityJet do not operate out of Pisa), but there was no-one in charge of directing us - it was up to passenger initiative to figure out all steps. Once at Florence Airport we were offloaded and sent on a Kafkaesque quest from office to office, into the bowels of the airport, across the tarmac, and into the arrivals hall to finally file the baggage claim. Had I not actively engaged fellow passengers I would have never figured out any of these procedures. This was on Sunday, 15th July, 2018. At the time of writing it is 10:30 pm on Tuesday July 17 and I have *still not received my bag*. I received a text yesterday evening from Florence Airport letting me know that the bag had been picked up by the courier, and nothing since. I have been forced to attend a professional event wearing the same outfit each day, which I am washing nightly in the hotel bidet. In all my years of frequent travel I have *never* encountered this level of disrespectful neglect. I paid over the odds to fly with CityJet, hoping to avoid the indignities of a budget airline, only to find that this airline treats one worse than dirt. Never again.",Negative,Positive
CityJet,airline,29 reviewsZafrullah Hamzah,2018-07-03,This City jet flight was operated for Air France. After arriving with an Air France flight in Paris from Singapore this Paris to Dublin flight was a big letdown compared to the service with an actual Air France flight. First of all after everyone has boarded their system recorded an error in their reservation . Simply bizarre that they only discovered this after letting everyone on board. This resulted in the plane not even moving from where it was parked for about 50 minutes after scheduled departure. We were then moving practically all over the airport for what seemed like they wanted us to view the runways before the plane actually took off. Service on board was quite slow. After being served the meal it seemed like they did not feel the need to clear the tray tables quickly. One stewardess managed to splash some Coca-Cola on the lady sitting beside me. She was very apologetic and nice but I got the impression that she was under pressure. On arrival in Dublin my bagage which had a priority tag after arriving in Paris on a first class flight was the 85th bagage to come out ! While Air France has consistently maintained high standards it appears that their City Jet partner just could not be bothered to do the same. As a result I missed the noon direct bus to Limerick and ended up having to use another bus company that took 3 hours and 45 minutes and a very convoluted route to get to Limerick. After spending so much to get priority service this connecting flight was a big disappointment and is way way below the service of an Air France operated flight.,Negative,Positive

It was not mentioned in the booking process on the Cheapflights website or Cobalt website that you have to pay for your bags and the surprise was in the airport where the manager on the check in desk was very unhelpful to accommodate the situation. The customer service lady asked for the price of the baggage and the extra weight, which we agreed to pay, however she changed the charge three times and each time my wife had to leave back beyond the security checkpoint to withdraw cash from the ATM machine and last time she stopped my wife at the door of the plane claiming that she still have to pay an extra amount of money because she did not calculate the charge properly.

In flight entertainment via their website to your device was an unexpected bonus and worked well for me, but I was the exception as a lot of passengers complained they were unable to connect. However, this airline has woeful customer service and the on-line check in procedure simply doesn't work. For customer service, you have to wait for a call back that never comes, tried to have a name changed on the ticket, but they refuse to do this (unlike other airlines, were it wasn't an issue, just went on line and altered it). You can't add baggage via website either you have to do this by phone. Come on Cobalt take a look at the competition and make improvements. I wouldn't use this airline again, their procedures are too clunky and not customer friendly, and they simply ripped us off as we had to purchase another ticket rather than let us change the name.",Negative,Positive

We let her ticket our luggage through to LHR, without collecting it at JNB, as she said it would work. Well, we’ll see. The lounge was frenetic, although food and drink were plentiful. The 737-800 was a new model, although Club seating was the usual Club Europe arrangement. Departure was delayed by 60 minutes, but that still left two hours for transfer on to the BA LHR flight.

Condor Airlines,airline,MIchael Shellman,2024-10-28,"We were re-routed onto this flight as our previous flight had been cancelled. Our luggage was not transferred from Swiss Air to Lufthansa in Milan Italy, so our baggage was flown to Zurich with virtually no way to make it to LA in a timely manner. We have AirTags in our luggage so I have been able to track where the bags are and have been. Both pieces of luggage were kept in Zurich Friday evening and then on Saturday were flown to LA. The luggage was received in LA late Saturday evening and is still at this writing Sunday afternoon, sitting in LA, allegedly to be delivered tomorrow when both my wife and I have to return to work and will not be here to receive them. I even offered to go pick up the bags myself in LA and was told that they would not be released to me. Over the course of the weekend since our flight on Friday, I have emailed Condor three times and have not received so much as even a courtesy response. I have called and spoken to Condor's mislabeled ""customer service"" only to be hung up on three times. I have asked to be transferred to a supervisor or higher up in order to try to resolve this circumstance and have either been hung up on or told that they don't have anything to do with baggage, that there is no number to call to speak to someone about delayed baggage, and that no supervisors were available. In the meantime our bags are sitting in LA some 30-40 miles away being held captive by Condor's baggage handlers and or (and I hesitate to call it) service. I have flown quite a number of times with a variety of different carriers and never have I been so poorly treated by any airline and their employees as I have in this circumstance with Condor Airlines.

Condor Airlines,airline,M Bale,2024-10-16,"I wish there was an option to give zero stars, and not one. I booked a flight through WestJet, who apparently partner with Condor (no clue why). I called the night before my flight to make sure that I had a checked bag included in my fare (if I didn't, I wanted to pay for one, as they are cheaper if you buy them before you get to the airport). I was told by the customer service representative that I did have a checked bag included in my fare. I pay for a seat (window seat) ahead of time, as I cannot sleep in any seat other than a window. I arrive to the airport the next day to be told by someone at the check-in desk that I do not have my checked bag included and will have to pay 250 Canadian Dollars for my bag, which is absolutely insane. I tell her I spoke to customer service and they told me I have a bag, and she said there's nothing she can do about that. She also told me I could upgrade to premium economy and have the bag included for 150 (bizarre pricing options but ok). I call customer service again and am told again that I do have a bag included, but she says that if I pay for the bag, I will be reimbursed. This is starting to feel sketchy to me, so I ask for proof of that in writing, over email, she says no. I ask for a recorded copy of the call, she says no. I ask her if I pay for premium economy (since its cheaper, and if I do end up getting scammed by all of this at least I will have had more leg room) if I will still be reimbursed since its actually cheaper than the checked bag fee, and she says yes. I go back to the counter, pay to upgrade and mention that I already paid for a window seat and would like a window seat since I already paid for one. I file all of my claims for the reimbursement before I board. Arrive on the flight: I have a middle seat, and the ""Premium Economy"" seats are smaller than some economy seats that I have sat in on other airlines and are incredibly uncomfortable, and the food is worse. I can't sleep at all on the flight. I continue to check in on my claim in the following weeks and am told very rudely by a customer service representative that I need to be 'more patient' because it could take up to 6 weeks to respond to my claim; this information was not mentioned anywhere or by anyone. I finally get a response to my claim, and it was denied, as they 'do not provide retroactive reimbursements for baggage fees', even though I was clearly told by a customer service representative that they did. The final line of that email was that they 'would be delighted if I would fly with condor again'...fat chance. I hope everyone considering Condor reads this and realizes that it would be so much more worth it to fly with literally any other airline. What a waste of my time and money.",Negative,Positive
Contour Airlines,airline,Thad Copeland,2023-11-21,"Worse Experience during a time of sorrow. Booked with American with a connecting flight via Contour. Contour cancelled the flight on 27 Oct into PAH. Was offered a new flight into Evansville, IN or Nashville TN at 6:30PM, this flight was 6 Hours after my original flight was to depart. Why does that time matter, the time of sorrow was my fathers wake was 5-8PM, i was due to arrive in PAH at12:45PM. The flights into Evansville and Nashville did not arrive until the same time as the next PAH flight at 7:45PM, the next PAH was was supposedly sold out. Flying into the 2 offered locations would require 2+ hrs driving and $500 in rental car expense, on a flight I could have booked through Southwest, Nonstop and $400 cheaper. Here is the issue, American Desk Agents, Phone agents, and Contour Phone Agents simply refused to contact each other. American rebooked me on the Nashville flight, without my knowledge, and Contour stating they can not make changes to American Itineraries, creating 6+ hrs of phone time between both Airlines, hobbling across 2 terminals on crutches to get to my family, In the end, I was forced to buy a 2nd seat on Contour, on a flight that was ""Sold Out"" to be told, I had 2 seats 20 minutes before boarding, which contour refused to refund, because I was cancelling within 24 hrs of the flight, but only 15 minutes after being told I didnt have seat. American and Contour refused to contact each other and American refused to talk to a Contour REP I had on the phone. Total 8 hrs on a 45 minute layover, $800+ dollars and a flight credit on an airline that flys no where.

Copa Airlines,airline,B Hamell,2025-01-14,"I am very disappointed with Copa Airlines. I’ve had a few flights with them lately, they are fine on short distance, but absolutely horrible long-haul. I’d understand their low standard if it was a budget airline, but their flights certainly weren’t cheap. I had a 7hour flight from Panama to Las Vegas. There was only one meal, no snacks, as you’d get with most airlines. But what was shocking is that they don’t have any special meals. As a vegetarian I couldn’t select vegetarian meal in advance, assuming they’d have a veggie option during the flight. How wrong was I! The two options they had was beef and chicken. Just as well I had the sense and bought something (overpriced) at the airport, so I wasn’t left starving the whole flight. I was very disappointed though, at this day and age special meals should be automatically included.  Their staff doesn’t seem to be well trained or have basic customer service skills either. Felt like they selected a few spare people at the airport, threw them into the plane to act as stewards. One was walking around and shouting like he was at a market stall, the other two seemed to be more interested in sharing their personal lives than us as paying customers. And another shocking part of the flight was that there are no screens on seats. For a long-haul flight. The only option was to connect to their Wifi, which was free for the entertainment channel, and watch it on the phone. With own earphones. Which was hard since I needed to charge my phone and had only wired earphones with me. The government in Panama is trying to entice tourists to visit their country, promoting it everywhere, but they should first look at their main airline. I wouldn’t go back to Panama if I had to fly with them again.",Positive,Negative

Copa Airlines,airline,Edward Ramkissoon,2024-12-14,"Today I flew with Copa Airlines from my home POS to PTY. I typically pay for seating with extra leg room as I experience lower back pains, and the lack of leg space exacerbates this, so and this was no exception. As the flight finished boarding all of its passengers I noticed there were many empty seats, both in coach and business, as such I asked one of the attendants if there was a possibility to be upgraded to business, more some comfortable seat for my back. The attendant then asked me if I had status with Copa to which I said I have not flown with them in a bit, and my miles had expired. He proceeded to tell me to fly more and maybe next time. Now, I understand I did not pay for business, but if I politely ask considering many empty seats, and being that I also paid for my seat, I would think that the airline staff would wanting me to fly more would accommodate and upgrade, but the fact that I was told to fly more, in my opinion is a reason to not fly with them going forward.",Negative,Positive

Tickets canceled due to COVID but refusal of reimbursement by the company which sends (without any explanation and without my agreement) vouchers directly following the cancellation emails. A year later, at my request, these vouchers (which are only valid for 1 year) are extended a second time because the company refuses reimbursement (although promised at the end of the validity date) on the pretext that they are in a statute of protection of the firms in bankruptcy and that to obtain a refunding I would have to introduce a procedure near a Czech court! Anyway it's too late because I'm out of time. All this happens via email and with incredible response times (when they dare answer because you have to systematically relaunch them). You don't have to be in a hurry with them. We are now at the end of validity of these second vouchers and I realize that Brussels is no longer even offered as a possible airport (nor any other in Belgium). I contact them directly by phone (in English, which they don't speak very well by the way) and they explain to me that the vouchers will expire in Oct 2022, that I just have to board at another airport that they serve, that they will not reimburse the vouchers and that they will not extend them either.

Cubana Airlines,airline,C Morton,2019-06-08,"Santiago de Cuba to Havana. My wife and I spent three weeks wandering Cuba and, overall, had a wonderful time filled with exceptional experiences... our flight with Cubana Airlines was not one of those experiences. If it were only the close to two hour delay we experienced (apparently this is a regular occurrence with Flight 205, Santiago to Habana), then I wouldn't be writing this negative review. The fact that they detained us and all their other delayed customers in a very hot, stuffy room with no air conditioning or fans... I'd be willing to let that slide. Even having to wait an extra hour at the baggage carousel for our checked bags wouldn't have inspired me... but after discovering that items had been stolen from both my bag & my wife's is when my real issue began. I personally picked up both my backpack & my wife's and carried them myself to our waiting taxi. I put them in the trunk of our taxi, where they stayed until we arrived at our destination. I was present when our driver opened his trunk & I then picked up both bags and carried them to our room, no one else touched our bags as soon as they were back in our custody and when we arrived in our room and began unpacking I we discovered items missing. All the items just so happened to be in the most easily accessed compartments of our bags. Unless our driver had someone hiding in his trunk then the theft had to have occurred while our bags were in Cubana Airline's custody. The next morning I contacted Cuba Travel Services (who we booked our tickets through) and they told me to send an email as soon as I got home, which I did. The folks at Cuba Travel Services were responsive and helpful, I believe they did all they could do, but an cannot offer any similar compliments for Cubana Airlines. After filing our theft claim we didn't hear back from Cubana Airlines for over a month at which point they explained that since I didn't file a claim at the airport in Havana, they weren't willing to do anything. I found this response unsatisfactory and absurd for a number of reasons, one being that there would be no reason for me to unpack our bags at the baggage carousel, so how could I possibly discover that we had items missing? Cubana Airlines only reached out to Cuba Travel Services, they made no effort to contact me directly, they have offered no compensation for the theft nor have they truly expressed any regret or apologies. They don't even seem concerned that they have employees handling customer's bags and stealing items while in their custody.

Cubana Airlines,airline,C Partane,2017-08-11,"Upon arrival to Cayo Largo, our luggage was lost after a direct flight from Toronto to Cayo Largo. A fiasco was about to start, nobody could help us locate our luggage, nobody knew how to contact Toronto to see if our luggage was sent on the plane, nobody understood what we were trying to ask. After the Cubana Hola Sun representative finally understood that we did not receive our luggage, and had an airport rep scribble on a piece of paper of apparently what seemed to be a lost luggage report. The Hola Sun rep insisted we get on a bus to our hotel, when we wanted to receive answers before leaving the airport on the status of where our luggage was located and how we can have access to it. Nobody wanted to make a call to Toronto. They indicated the only flight from Toronto to Cayo Largo was the 5th of August, the day we were leaving Cayo Largo, and we had no other options in regards to receiving our luggage. We left the airport after the Hola Sun rep told us she would take care of this. The next morning at our group meeting with the same Hola Sun Cubana rep, she did not recognize us and did not know we had lost our luggage. She scribbled beside our room number lost luggage. She told us again that she had no way of contacting Toronto to see where our luggage was and that she had no control in this matter. The following day we approached the rep yet again about our lost luggage and that we had nothing for the entire week in the deserted island of Cayo Largo, she said we should contact the Cubana rep at the Cayo Largo that only works after 1PM. She again did not want to call Toronto Cubana Airline for us to see if the luggage was there or not. The next day, she had no idea who we were and said she did not deal with lost luggage. Finally, day 4 of our trip, still no baggage, no sunscreen, no clothes, no snorkelling kits, no shoes, a new rep comes on duty and immediately takes charge and types a Microsoft Word document stating we lost our luggage and signs it, still no report sent to YYZ stating they lost our luggage. She then tells us she spoke to the Cayo Largo Airport rep of Cubana that will send our luggage to Cayo Largo tomorrow via Varadero. The next morning, we prepare to be ready for the arrival of the 6.45AM plane from Varadero, to finally receive our luggage. Nothing, nobody knows, no claims about lost luggage, no reports, no file #. Day 6, we go see the rep again, who states your luggage could have never sent because YYZ Cubana is on strike, sorry. Day 7, finally we leave this fiasco, on route to YYZ to see about where could our luggage be. We arrive in YYZ at 1AM, no reports about lost luggage, nobody at Baggage Claim knows what we are talking about, Cubana. He brings us into a closet, hundreds of lost luggage unorganized piled on top of each other, a dozen of strollers, bugs, humidity smell, and he says to check in there by ourselves. Desperate, we search through the piled on top of each other, nothing. The Baggage Claim in YYZ tells us to call in the morning, nobody knows and there's no claim report in their system and they refuse to file an official report for us in the system, stating only this one person can do the actual report. 2AM we drive 5 hours home hoping maybe the luggage was sent home during our time away. Nothing. 5 days of phone calls, we find the luggage.",Negative,Positive

The communication on the steps taken to remediate has been proactive and constant, while the Delta app has been far behind in terms of updates during the whole time. However, the communication on the available options couldn't have been worse. One cabin crew said we could offboard and come back, another said the opposite. When redirected to a manager, I have been told that we would deplane all deplane shortly. Less than two minutes later, another cabin crew announced that we'd be done in 15 minutes. And so on and so forth for 3.5 hours now. One cabin crew in particular has been quite rude when asked for clarifications. He patronizingly retorted that maybe I shouldn't get off the plane if I'm concerned about being able to get back on. How would anyone not be concerned given the circumstances?!

I arrived at the airport this morning to take the flight from Incheon. First the self check in didn’t work, so I had to stand in their long line which took about 40 minutes. I was already late and was scared to miss my flight. I told a lady that my flight was very soon but she pretty much ignored me and told me to stay in line, so I didn’t get any further in line. I had to wait.  Once I finally made it to the counter, the woman was unable to speak any English. She didn’t even try to. She was keep talking to me in Korean even though I told her my Korean is very limited. Then she refused to give me my ticket because somehow she thought that I’ve overstayed my visa in Korea. It clearly says that I have to leave Korea by October 29th but she kept insisting it said 23rd. Again all in Korean which I didn’t understand so I had to let my husband who is fluent in Korean talk to her. I finally got mad and told her it says 29th and apparently she finally issued me my ticket. Without any apology. Staff members were surround her but didn’t bother to help either or speak English to me.

We were repeatedly assured that we will depart as soon as the plane was fixed. In their first announcement, EA agents announced to waiting passengers that the flight was rescheduled for 3pm of that day only to have it changed to 11pm. Again the flight was rescheduled to May 13th, 2022 at 2:00 am, but it failed to take off despite repeated and multiple assurances from EA agents. While waiting at the boarding lounge, we were forced from there to outside the security cordon so that we had to go through TSA check-in and immigration twice. Throughout the day we were bounced from terminal to terminal and gate to gate. We had to lug our luggage from one part of the airport to another. Not only did we carry heavy luggage but some of us have disabilities, medical conditions children while others are elderly which made movement around the airport torturous.

Friendly crew and a drink, snack given. The key is ""if"" you get to fly, my return flight was cancelled at the last minute and alternative offered was to be squeezed into a taxi with other passengers for 5 plus hours and miss my last train home from Gatwick which would leave me abandoned at Gatwick overnight. Or fly the next day but they won't pay for an overnight hotel in Newquay or any taxi fees or expenses.

The plane was delayed for more than 1.30 hours in Pereira, which made my mum very stressed as she could miss the appointment (which had costed me much more than the plane ticket). I spoke to the airline over the phone and asked them for compensation, they told me that the passengers usually get offered compensation at the airport. They lied. My mum was only offered a sandwich lunch. When I asked the airline the amount of compensation I could get, they tried to avoid the question and did not give me any answers. In the end, they told me to fill in a form online, that who knows how long they will take to come back me with an answer.

Still hot inside, at least the flight took off, now two hours late. During the above ordeal inside the plane, the washrooms were locked. When asked why this was so, the answer was due to security.  After complaints from many passengers, the cabin staff finally relented and opened the bathrooms. Next flight was on MS 787 (CAI to MUC; 10/01/25) business class. The flight boarded two hours late due to the captain’s seat having to be replaced. Again, no announcements from the airport staff and when people inquired, they were unresponsive.

The only aspect that was speedy was the actual Boarding. Where unlike most airlines they didn’t use the frustrating “geoup” system and let people board after business class. Once seated discovered my screen didn’t work. I alerted cabin crew on two different occasion before take off. No apology and little explanation. As screen didn’t work I couldn’t use entertainment system. Then discovered that power point didn’t. Worn either so I couldn’t use my phone as I needed power when I landed. Then discovered my light didn’t work either as no power and finally discovered that my seat didn’t recline. I alerted Egyptian the day I landed.

El Al Israel Airlines,airline,Steeve Benhamou,2024-05-28,"Review of flight LY320 - ELAL Company I traveled today on the flight of May 27, departing from Charles de Gaulle at 11:10 a.m. towards Tel Aviv, arriving at 5 p.m. a little late on flight LY320 with the ELAL company and I must say that this was an absolutely deplorable experience. The flight attendants seemed to be on the verge of depression: very nonchalant and extremely rude. The plane was extremely small, with absolutely no room to stretch your legs. Traveling with a baby was a nightmare. There was no empathy or understanding from the flight attendants to allow us to let our child sleep. I had to sacrifice myself and stand the entire flight, and by the end our little one was sleeping soundly in both seats. My wife also had to get up to let him sleep. Despite this, the staff made us wake up our child in the middle of sleep, supposedly to put on the seat belt, even though we were not yet in the landing phase of a certain TAL. This ended with staff intimidating me, asking for my passport and becoming very threatening, without even letting me speak. (""I'm going to call the police"") The plane itself was without a TV and very small. The service was disastrous: they weren't even able to serve me tea properly, giving me an already used tea bag. A horror, a real horror. I totally deplore this Negligence. ELAL has lost all quality of service. It is strongly advised to avoid paying too much for a non-charter flight, as you can find much cheaper and much more comfortable flights. The staff of this company have no love of the job and seem to do it by huffing and puffing non-stop. This message about the deplorable theft of the El Al company absolutely does not reflect what I have experienced before. My love for Israel will never be questioned. I don't want to create confusion, but I want to say that this flight was a disaster. It is imperative that the company takes matters into its own hands.FR:Avis sur le vol LY320 - Compagnie ELAL J'ai voyagé ce jour le vol du 27 mai départ de Charles de Gaulle à 11h10 vers Tel Aviv arrivé 17h avec un peu de retard sur le vol LY320 avec la compagnie ELAL et je dois dire que ce fut une expérience absolument déplorable. Le personnel de bord semblait être au bord de la dépression : très nonchalant et extrêmement impoli. L'avion était extrêmement petit, avec absolument aucune place pour étendre les jambes. Voyager avec un bébé était un cauchemar. Il n'y avait aucune empathie ni compréhension de la part du personnel de bord pour nous permettre de laisser notre enfant dormir. J'ai dû me sacrifier et rester debout tout le vol, et à la fin, notre petit dormait profondément sur les deux sièges. Ma femme a également dû se lever pour le laisser dormir. Malgré cela, le personnel nous a imposé de réveiller notre enfant en plein sommeil soi-disant pour mettre la ceinture, alors que nous n'étions même pas encore en phase d'atterrissage une certaine TAL. Cela a fini par une intimidation de la part du personnel, me demandant mon passeport et devenant très menacant , sans même me laisser m'exprimer. (« Je vais appeler la police ») L'avion lui-même était sans télé et très petit. Le service était désastreux : ils n'ont même pas été capables de me servir un thé correctement, me donnant un sachet de thé déjà usagé. Une horreur, une véritable horreur. Je déplore totalement cette Negligeance . ELAL a perdu toute qualité de service. Il est vivement conseillé d'éviter de payer trop cher pour un vol non charter, car vous pouvez trouver des vols bien moins onéreux et beaucoup plus confortables. Le personnel de cette compagnie n'a pas l'amour du métier et semble le faire en soufflant et soupirant non-stop. Ce message sur le vol déplorable de la compagnie El Al ne reflète absolument pas ce que j’ai connu auparavant. Mon amour pour Israël ne sera jamais mis en question. Je ne souhaite pas créer d’amalgame, mais je tiens à dire que ce vol a été une catastrophe. Il est impératif que la compagnie reprenne les choses en main.",Negative,Positive

Ellinair,airline,Christine Croxton,2018-11-23,"Heraklion to Athens. We bought the online ticket because it included hold baggage in the price and appeared to be the most reasonable. We checked in very easily as there was no one at the checkin desk. We had our bags tagged and sent on the conveyor belt at 10am. Alls good. We had a quick flight to Athens all on time. Within 15 minutes of arriving at Athens we were able to pick up our bags off the carousel. Took them to the taxi. Less than an hour later we checked in our Athens Plaka Hotel. My husband went to open his bag and to his dismay he found the toggle openers of his Osprey pack had 5 out of the 6 missing off his zips making it virtually impossible to open. I immediately emailed Ellinair, they responded and said a complaints department would contact us. They did but because we hadn’t notified the people at the airport they couldn’t do anything about it. Well, we didn’t notice the missing handles at that point. Anyway, since then we have realised that the bag had been opened and new gloves had been stolen.  For this reason we wouldn’t go near Ellinair or Heraklion Airport ever again. The most reasonable ticket has ended up costing us a lot more than we bargained for. We are incensed that there are staff who are dishonest and clearly not enough checks are done when employing people.

Emirates,airline,Graeme Lowther,2025-01-18,"Wow! Ever since the the Aussie exec management left the airline, Emirates had been in a quality nose dive. It has gone from being a luxury carrier to being more like a low cost airline. Flying in business class now feels like economy used to be. Here is how the quality has collapsed IMO You no longer get an amenities bag unless you are overnight. The quality of the wine in business class has been reduced from nice Loire, South African or Aussie quality wines, to cheap plonk. Makes no sense. The quality of the food is utterly disgusting. I'm not kidding here. Check the photo of the business class vegetarian meal that I uploaded with this review. Twice they have served me this POW camp slop in business class. Defies all expectations. No accompaniments, no chutney, or sauces. Just brown slop in white rice. What I don't understand is why they are so gung-ho on cost cutting while passenger numbers and revenue are at an all time high. They are cutting their own throats because carriers like Qatar are still offering really great quality service. In fact (and I never thought I would think this) Saudia business class beats Emirates on food quality. (Actually, if you look at the photo of my business class meal, everyone beats that). Emirates customer service is now more concerned with revenue retention than with fulfilling the ticket terms, and can be quite combative. I have noticed that changing a ""Flex Plus"" ticket, despite being fully changeable always attracts a fare change, even when the original class of ticket if still available to buy in Emirates.com. I had such a fight with them I refunded the entire Flex Plus ticket and rebought the travel in my new date at the lower price I don't know what happening, I have a real soft spot for Emirates. At one time they set the bar for quality, but that's not true anymore and it makes me really sad.",Negative,Positive
Emirates,airline,Judy Godlieb,2024-12-20,I had the most horrible experience on Emirates Flight # EK 27 . I had already arrived from Colombo to Dubai on EK649 at least they were courteous and friendly. My connecting flight from Dubai to Glasgow was a nightmare. I had booked a diabetic meal and imagine I got the meal minus water. I needed to take my meds and numerous requests were ignored by very arrogant flight attendants specially one of them on this particular flight. After two and a half hours I received 1 cup of water . I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated and when I asked if I could have a bottle of water she curtly replied they do not have bottled water. She took off before I could ask for another cup of water. However passengers seated in front of me were served with water and juice . This didn't solve my problem as I just couldn't get a juice or water at that moment. After about another hour I kept buzzing for a flight attendant and no one came . When the 2nd meal was served I received a small bottle of water and by then I was feeling dehydrated. I'm 63 and not in the best of health . Is this fair? I have lodged a complaint with Emirates and I'm waiting for the response they say they will send me.  Unfortunately I have a return flight from Glasgow to Dubai and Dubai to Colombo and I feel violated and traumatized to think of what to expect . One thing for sure is I will never fly Emirates again. I'm just disgusted. That long walk from terminal to terminal and then taking a bus or the train is equally insane. I paid for Marhaba meet and greet service since I know with mobility issues I would miss the flight. Thankfully the Marhaba service lady was an Angel and so helpful something that the arrogant flight stewardess could learn. It doesn't cost anything to be nice. This was a long haul flight and I would have expected water to be provided in unlimited quantity. Shame on you Emirates. So much for your so called service you boast about. I'm done. I was going to see my 6 year old grandson after 5 years in Scotland and what should have been a happy journey was a nightmare. Unfortunately I have to go again via the same route on this heartless airline. Never again will I take that risk. I have flown Emirates prior and those short flights were so delightful.

Disliked the practice of sending economy passengers to a kiosk in TLL to get a boarding pass where you pay 10 euros. Once had a delay of 20 minutes which the captain explained announcements over the speakers were very distorted and hard to understand. Boarding at TLL was a mess.

An item may have been left on the plane and we cannot get in touch with anybody to inquire about lost and found. The operator on the phone barely understood what I was saying language barrier.

Evelop Airlines,airline,L Marney,2019-09-07,"Madrid to Havana. They lost our luggage on arrival in Cuba. At the airport we were told it would be sent to us when it arrived. Their call centre was closed the whole weekend and so we had to email them. We finally got a response from them 5 days later. Our luggage had already been in Havana for 2 days by this stage, but we had moved to our next destination. We were informed they would not be sending our luggage to us, and that we had to pick it up from Havana airport, 4 hours away from where we were staying at that point. Getting our luggage back at Havana Airport was a nightmare. The airport staff locked us in a cage (I am not even joking, I wish I was) and made us wait hours before they would attend to us. When they finally did, they took our passports into a closed office and made us wait outside. Very bad, and not to mention a security risk on so many levels. When we arrived back to Madrid, we sent an email explaining the whole situation to Evelop. We have requested compensation, which is outlined the European Law, in regards to emergency clothing and supplies purchased for the trips since we had no clothes, shoes - only what we had worn on the plane. It's now been 3 weeks and all Evelop have done is consistently ask us for more ""documents"". We originally sent the Irregularity report from the airport (which anyway contains every single detail they actually need to sort out the case) but then they asked us for boarding cards, baggage tags, even a copy of our original reservation with the booking reference! This is so unnecessary and it is very obvious that they are avoiding taking any responsibility whatsoever for the situation. They have not yet bothered to reply in regards to any resolutions for the inconvenience or the cost. If they would a good airline, they would have offered an apology and gone above and beyond to provide compensation for the incompetence we experienced in regards to the luggage they lost. I strongly advise against using this airline at all cost.",Negative,Positive

However when we got to the airport they would not honour the seat reservations and we had to be given different seats. This was very difficult for us because my son is Autistic and doesn't like change. The check in desk say they have never been able to reserve seats on Evelop flights so just be aware that this is a rip off! Also worth remembering the leg room is very limited.

When I called and told the phone agent this, they told me the company is not responsible for those charges or changes. We had to leave a very expensive resort (we saved years for this trip for our 25th anniversary) at an ungodly hour to make it to the flight that moved from 12.15pm to 7 am with no other options.

Ravn Alaska,airline,Philippe Clauwaert,2020-04-16,"I work 2 weeks on, 2 off, and have flown with this company 13 times in the last eight months. Of those 13 flights, at least 10 of them either had long delays, some over 5 hours, or were simply canceled because of no aircraft or crews available. What irritates me the most is that their customer service never answers emails, ever! I had my employer pay extra for the morning flight, about $75.00, and most of my morning flights were rebooked to the cheaper afternoon flight. My employer never got a refund for that extra charge. They charge you 2 different fees for extra bags, depending on the type of aircraft used. As I personally knew some of their agents in Anchorage, I never had an issue with them. However the staff elsewhere are distant, unfriendly, uncaring, and sometimes rude. I should not fear dealing with a csa when I go to the airport, however that is the feeling I have all the time. I noticed one day that my mileage number was missing, and since no one was at the counter, I decided to give it to the boarding agent. She faked entering my number in the computer, indeed I never got any credit for that flight. Their website does not give you the point balance, but a csa at the airport told me one day that I had 10 points, ""which entitles you to nothing"". One time, they cancelled my flight back to Anchorage, and rebooked me one way DLG to ANC on a later flight that day. So, just to make sure everything was fine for the return flight, I called Ravn. I was told, without any further assistance, that my reservation was cancelled, and there was nothing they could do because it was an Alaska Airlines ticket, which I was completely unaware of. I ended up calling Alaska Airlines, spending over 40 minutes on the phone with a supervisor, who fixed my ticket, but asked me to explain why I did not use the first segment, which automatically cancelled the return portion. Incompetence, rudeness, unreliability and overall poor service is what I remember the most from them.",Negative,Positive

They stated there were 5 open seats at that time and we would be notified over the speaker at 3:20. That time came and went .. we asked at the counter only to be told it would be announced. As the plane filled they called my husband and another passenger on standby. We approached the desk. We were told my name was 4th down the line from my husbands. We asked why .... no one knew, we were carelessly directed here and there. We returned to the ticket desk to see why we were not (Authorized) together. The baggage supervisor was the only one available. He stated that customers are put in a (class) based on their ticket. We were not treated fairly or the same because I utilized a reward for a portion of my ticket for being a valued member. This is shocking and a travesty that you punish your customers for utilizing rewards. We were not informed and this really needs corrected and adjusted. We over the years have dealt with Ravn rarely being on time, long delays where we have missed connecting flights, charged for baggage when we are part of the ALASKA 49 club and the Ravn rewards club. We have had to purchase new tickets on the spot because they couldn’t FIND our reservation only to find them later and refund only the lowest fare. They have chosen to disregard my complaints and not see any reason to believe these situations occurred.

Fiji Airways,airline,1 reviewsN Heaney,2024-08-09,"Fiji Airways caveat emptor. Sorry this is Long: We took Fiji Airway Business class from LAX-NAN-KDV June 21st as a Tabau club member. We arrived at LAX at 2PM given the next connection would be tight and moved from the AA terminal to Bradley and found a seat, at 15:30 we get at text and email from Fiji Airways that out flight is delayed 18 hours (4PM Saturday). I immediately call the #800 and they are mostly clueless about the flight and are totally clueless when I ask about a hotel voucher. Basically, they tell me we are on our own which and the Contract of Carriage does not require them to pay even though it was their mechanically issue. We all know that this is a lie. I call, and get a hotel nearby and we head to the hotel. Once there I get notifications of our rebooking to KDV on Wednesday even though we arrive Sunday night late. I call Fiji Airways again and find that they are booked solid to KDV Monday and have no flights to KDV Tuesday. I asked about the hotel the night of the 21st in LAX and hotel in NAN Sunday-Wednesday. They tell me we are on our own again. I decided to book my own charter to the place we are going to 1.5-hour boat ride from KDV. Saturday 22nd arrive at the airport for check in and find out if we had stayed until at the airport until Friday at 18:30 (no 1 told us) we would have gotten hotel vouchers and $70s in meal per diem. WHAT! I write Fiji Airways and get no response and no response from manager at check-in. In flight service is really really good, comfortable beds just nice people and apologies given multiple times. Get to NAN and again, in Business Class and Tabau club member and get meet and greet and ask for hotel voucher and taxi payment. Again, we are not required to give you this. It is late and we have early AM charter. Paid for the hotel and charter as we were not going to lose 3 days of vacation. So we get back 7/7 KDV-NAN-LAX no problems, and I put on a full court press to get paid for hotel in LAX and NAN and taxi both ways in NAN and per diem and refund on NAN-KDV for my wife and I. On 7/10 after much back and forth and sending receipts 3x they finally agreed to a refund via wire transfer, but it takes 21 days. August 1, I write and ask where is the money? Response we will check into it. August 5th, I write again and finally get a response saying I will be paid by the 9th nada. Wrote them again, but it is time to let everyone know how things are a Fiji Airways! Fiji Airway is great if things go right but when they do not, they are completely incompetent. I am out for the hotels and per diem at over $850 not even counting the charter. If flying to Fiji from the USA consider that your choices are direct flights from LAX and SFO and Fiji Airways at about 11+ hours or Qantas to Syndey and back or Air New Zealand to Auckland and back at more like 18+ of travel time. The choices are not great! We loved Fiji, but Fiji Airways is horrible (maybe worse that horrible) when things do not go right.",Negative,Positive
Finnair,airline,S Horten,2025-02-23,"If you fly with Finnair triple check the booking and plan for double expenses. I flew back and forth from Tokyo to Stockholm with my 8-month-old baby and my wife. We booked the flight around half a year before the scheduled date and I was trying to use their website to book the type of meals and seats we would need such as a bassinet for our baby. I checked several times after reserving the seats on the website and it seemed to remember the seats I had chosen. Since it was around 20 hours per trip I needed to make sure that we could have a bassinet seat for our baby. Come the day of the flight and we were seated in the middle of the plane with little space and not being able to sleep as I had to hold my child end make sure that people walking by didn't bump into her. It was an excruciating experience and after pleading to the cabin attendant even though said that she would try to get us a seat and come back to me later she never came. Other cabin attendants could not help either as I tried several times. Scared that the same experience would befall upon us on our trip back I had to pay extra to use their wifi and book a front row seat for the next flight when I noticed that the website could not conclude the booking of seats even though it seemed like it would. I had to download their application and book the seat from there due to supposedly faulty software. I was scarred by this experience and knew better than to think my seat would be fine by just booking it this time around so I called their support to double check (which I had to do through my Japanese SIM card which cost even more money). Low and behold the seat I had managed to book in the front row would not be able to have a baby bassinet and there was no indication during the booking that that would be the case. So I asked her to fix it (mind you about a month before said flight) and she said that it could not be arranged and that we had to change flights. The change of flight would cost us a substantial amount extra compared to what we had paid for our ticket and nothing would be covered by them until I created a feedback ticket. We had to lengthen our trip by several days costing us even more money outside of our planned expenses. When she had booked my seat, I asked her if my wife would be sitting beside me or not as she had not said any such thing. No, then we had to pay extra for that seat as well. She didn’t suggest placing my wife in the seat next to me. During the flight back they handled our baggage in such a violent fashion that a wheel was ripped out of its socket and the suitcases were battered and bruised. Also they had made a mistake and the diet selection on our meal had not gone through (thank god I don’t select my meals due to allergies!). I have an open support ticket with them still but they have yet to compensate me and their replies take weeks to arrive.",Negative,Positive
Finnair,airline,119 reviewsMichael Schade,2025-01-04,"The journey started badly at DUS airport with just one checkin counter open for all classes and all passenger on an almost full A320. The line stretched through the half length of the terminal hall. Passenger and the poor checkin guy were equally frustrated and stressed. Contract airport lounge decent and not too crowded. Flight to Helsinki uneventful and on time. Helsinki Finnair Platinum lounge as always great in terms of design, F&B, and service. Unfortunately, its opening hours spoiled that good impression. The lounge closes at 5.30 pm, just before all the long haul flights depart and everyone was herded into the next door business class lounge which by then was so crowded that I left. What’s the point of having a wonderful lounge for their most loyal customer and it’s closed at peak hour? The long haul flight had a different configuration with no premium economy washroom, which made the trip to the economy cabin a very long journey with long lines waiting to be greeted by a messy toilet. Service was ok, but catering (or rather the lack of it) was simply insufficient for such a 12hours flight. Finnair does a lot of things right, but the unacceptable opening hours of their premium lounge and their inadequate catering on long haul flights cannot convince me (yet) to make my switch from my usual one world carrier.",Negative,Positive

I was very annoyed with the last moment cancellation of flight as it disrupted my journey, how can I accept the reschedule when my return flight was earlier than departure flight. I was wondering is this the illogical way Firefly works? No wonder they have operations issue. To my anger, few days later, the Airline published additional flights for 29/1/2025 departure from Subang, but the ticket price was 3 times higher than the one I purchased in Nov 2024. I wrote a protest email to the Airlines and was told that they only received approval to have additional flights on 24/1/2025 - a day after they cancelled my departure flight; and since I have asked for full refund, there was nothing they can do.

Firefly,airline,Tze Wee Chan,2024-08-20,"My return flight from Penang was retimed. Since I purchased free flight change for both ways of my flight, I attempted to change the flight to an earlier one. This option was disabled on the ""Manage My Booking"" link on my login page on the app. I then went on live chat to resolve this issue since this airline has no customer line. I initiated the chat at 7.41pm and received a response 1.5hours later at 9.18pm. I was informed that I could change my flight, provided the new return flight request, and was then informed during the same live chat - that I was not eligible to change my flight. Basically, the airline cancelled my free flight change purchase without notification, after they retimed the flight. With this situation and with my flight due the next morning, I had no choice but to purchase a new flight ticket which cost me an additional RM468.31 (one-way) - this price also included a Change Fee of RM150.00. It took them 2 weeks and many emails further to respond to my initial complaints - they offered to resolve this with a RM81 refund payment in lieu of the cost of the one-way free flight change that was indiscriminately canceled with no advance notice. There is no mention and no further resolution towards the additional costs that were unnecessarily incurred due to their wrongdoing.

Flair Airlines,airline,Jason Cain,2024-12-22,"I flew from Calgary to Toronto in July, and after I landed, my bag was nowhere to be found. Flair had no idea where it was. Luckily, I had the foresight to put an Apple AirTag in my bag. I tracked it myself, discovered it was still in Calgary, and watched it make its slow journey to Toronto. When I contacted Flair’s team at Toronto airport, they were utterly clueless. They couldn’t tell me where it was, and I had to track it down by myself, using the app to locate a locked room in the airport. The real kicker? I asked a Flair agent to open the door to retrieve my bag, and she was shocked I had managed to find it. It was clear that they had no idea what was going on. They promised me a baggage fee refund for the trouble, but here we are six months later, and I still haven’t seen a penny. Every time I follow up, I get the same response: “It will be another 30-60 days.” They think because I'm from Australia, I'll just forget about it. Well, I haven’t, and I’m now pursuing legal action.  To make matters worse, Flair Airlines doesn't just fail to deliver on promises—they charge you at every opportunity. I paid an extra fee for my hand luggage at check-in because the staff claimed it was too big.

Fly540.com,airline,M Lameeric,2018-06-12,Kisumu to Nairobi. It was my first time to fly with 540. I arrived relatively early for my flight because I was travelling with a toddler. The check in Counter in Kisumu was not yet open so I had to wait almost an hour which was not a Problem. Finally I saw that the Check in was open and decided to check in. I had two 20kg bags. One for me and another for my son because he had his own seat. Shock on me when i went they told me my son has excess baggage. How was this possible when I checked and rechecked on their Website and confirmed that the allowance for him is also 20kg. Then the guy who was checking me in even confirmed with his colleague that the allowance for my child is only 10Kg. After much arguing he gave up and took my bags. Later at the waiting Lounge I Googled and confirmed that he also has 20kg like me. shame on you Fly 540. Your employees are scammers and will try to get whatever they can from customers. if they had found some inexperienced customers who dont know the rules they would have duped him. Then add to the fact that the flight had an almost 2 hour delay with no communication whatsoever from you. And no apology . Will never fly 540.

Fly540.com,airline,H Birteels,2017-11-24,"Nairobi to Eldoret. This is by far the worst airline I have ever used in my life of 65 years of international travel for three reasons. The terminal managers deliberately withheld information from all passengers as to the fact that the flights were delayed, and how long the delays would be, making it impossible for the passengers to call ahead and make new arrangements for their appointments and ground transportation, just because they were embarrassed to admit the delay in the first place. The delays were very very long and endemic (1.5 hours, 1.15 hours) although the itineraries were very short (30 min., 45 min. flights) to near in-country destinations; and the ""flexi plus"" fare, which is higher than other tickets, was supposed to afford the ability to change reservations according to advertising without an extra charge; however, when I changed one flight by a few hours, I was charged extra for a ""new reservation fee"" and ""new E ticket fee"" and was directed to the ""fine print"". The terminal managers continually lied to all of the passengers about the fact of delays while, all the time, continuing to post on the monitors that the flights were ""on time"" even when the time had passed. They also fabricated delay estimates in 10 min intervals when pressured to tell us how long the delay would be, with very long explanations of where the plane was, why it hasn't arrived, and the fact that no one anywhere in the organization had any estimates as to the delayed departure times or whether we would ever depart. This act of deliberate rudeness enraged many passengers who vowed never to ride this airline again. There are two other airlines in Kenya to choose from, one of which has an excellent reputation and has airplanes painted like giraffes. I chose this airline because it seemed to be convenient to book online. A big mistake. You can book online with the other airlines too, and they are responsive by telephone for reservations and changes.",Negative,Positive

I refused to pay extra to put my cabin bag in the hold and told them it should be up to them to cover the costs or allow me to take the bag into the cabin.

I refused to accept this and told her I wasn’t going to pay extra when it was already included in my ticket, she then had a total meltdown. That shocked me and turned the disagreement into an argument. The next minute whilst I was still discussing this with the lady checking me in she called security and had me taken off the flight.

flybondi,airline,Joseph Azzopardi,2024-03-26,"This is the absolute worst airline. If you have a carefully planned trip do not fly with Flybondi as they will change your flight times and change which airport you fly to with just a couple of hours notice, making it impossible to make any airb&b that you have already paid for, car reservations etc. We had three flights booked with them and they changed the times and destination airport of every single one of them multiple times. We booked a flight from Jujuy to Buenos Aires then from that same airport with a couple of hours waiting from Buenos Aires to Iguazú. They changed the airport we were landing to another airport and delayed the flight time so it would make it impossible to catch the next flight. When we tried to complain they refused to refund us our ticket or provide transportation and insisted we had to buy another ticket for the evening flight out. Meaning missing all the activities we had planned for that day. Hours before they changed also the next flight and again the other one so they eventually offered a transfer from one airport to another, by this time we had already spent extra 70.000 pesos in between first row seats and private transport to ensure our fast exit. When we finally got to the second flight with the transfer provided our seats had been given to priority passengers without us being informed and they wanted to charge us extra for taking the carry on on the plane even the previous flight despite being told by the personnel at the previous airport that we could take it on. We were allowed to take it with us because we had recorded the staff saying this so their hands were tied (good tip for those traveling. Record your conversations if you are unsure) Then when trying to fly out of Iguazu they changed the airport we were flying into again and change our flight arrival time twice. Resulting in a 5 hour delay meaning we would land at 1am so no one could let us into our airb&b. They are an absolute scam of an airline who are just out to rob you of your money.

The visa had to be received right after my flight confirmation. Meanwhile, I did not receive anything. After thousands of times trying to apply for it, it was not possible. No any website is operating to apply, they never answered my call for 2,3 days. no chats, I emailed them several times , did not get ANY reply. The only time they answered was to ask my name and PNR and again disappeared. I found someone to at least get connected there in Flynas and try to at least CANCEL this sad flight. No possibility either. Giving abnormal reasonings, telling your layover is for 7 hours you can't pack your luggage, meanwhile, I don't have a luggage at all and it is MY right to ask for a visa, it is NON of their business. So it's a big scam and they admit it, which is worse. Neither that visas are free of charge. when they promote it to buy from Flynas airlines to get it for free, then you have to pay so-called administrative fee which is around 25 USD xD, but then they call it a free visa. ZERO customer support. no professional, they even told me "" It does not matter what we write on a website, we just write it"" So they by themselves approve that they are lying and misleading a large amount of people only to scam their money for twice more fees. They refused even to change the layover time when they have flights every hour from Dubai to Riyadh and from Riyadh to Amman. Refused ANY kind of assistance, for a refund of the ticket they told me ZERO dollars. So I have to take a flight and be stuck in the airport for many long hours because of their lack of reliability.

Georgian Airways,airline,B Arabuli,2024-10-08,"My son and I had a flight scheduled from Milan’s Bergamo airport Tbilisi and due to an issue at the airport most flights were delayed, cancelled or redirected to another airport in Milan. Our experience with Georgian Airways is that they have zero customer service or any kind of communication to us or the airport, they do not answer phone calls, or respond to emails. Luckily, my husband was in Tbilisi and had to physically attend their head office to see any Georgian Airways representative. At that time, he was given a phone number of a person in Milan that is a key contact for the airline in the city. Initially, this individual was responsive and supported enquiries from both myself and my husband. However, as time went on, the Georgian Airways flight disappeared from the airport’s announcement boards and so did the support of this Georgian airways representative. She stopped responding to messages from me and calls from my husband. We had no information at all for 12 hours about the flight and then the flight reappeared on the airport information board as “cancelled” but no remedy was offered. My son and I spent almost 24 hours at the airport not knowing anything and how we might get back to Tbilisi. The next morning, as we were collecting our checked in luggage, an unscheduled flight by Georgian Airways to Tbilisi appeared on the information board as being “redirected” to the other Milan airport. These flights normally only run on Tuesdays and Fridays between Bergamo and Tbilisi. I contacted the Georgian Airways representative again, thinking this must be our replacement flight. I was not holding out hope for her response given her lack of communication back to me the previous night but her answer shocked me even more. She advised that our flight was redirected in the middle of the night and had already left Milan. Flabbergasted, exhausted and appalled would be the least of the emotions experienced at this point. I asked her how this could be possible when none of the airport staff knew anything about the flight until it was cancelled at 11pm, plus there was no contact from Georgian Airways via email or phone, no airport announcements, or contact from her when she knew I was stranded in the airport with a child. My husband had to go to the head office again and was only able to get a no cost replacement flight for us on the Friday schedule with my photo evidence of the information board stating the flight cancellation and evidence of the lack of response from their Milan representative in my WhatsApp messages. I do believe that the airline made up an elaborate lie about transferring the flight in the middle of the night to abscond from the service responsibilities - my husband advised that they were very reluctant and gave multiple conflicting reasons in order to make us pay again. I hope this experience deters you from using this airline or at least you will be fully informed on what to expect if things go wrong.",Negative,Positive
Georgian Airways,airline,Mikhail Chernykh,2023-07-20,"I do not recommend anyone to fly with this company because they have 0 customer support and Georgian Airways is not responsible for any loss or damage they cause.

After two weeks with no single reply, I forwarded my complaint and the damage report to the email address again and included the general address as well. After a month of waiting for nothing I reached the central office of Georgian Airways on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. There were four operators working, and they told me they do not have anyone responsible for damaged baggage and no customer support as it is. They asked me to address the issue at the same counter at the airport having given a phone number for me to call. When I called the number the manager from that end replied that she is only in charge of the lost luggage and no way she can deal with the damaged one. I left Tbilisi and was abroad for a while and when I came back to the same airport I approached the manager at the same old desk of Georgian Airways with the same old issue. She shouted at me saying she does not know anything. When I demanded to leave a claim and paper complaint she refused to help and just started ignoring me. In the process, I have also reached the airport administration which politely said they can not assist me with the claim. So, the conclusion is obvious and just one.

As the departure is in different area of airport to lounge (accessible only by a mono-rail and no return allowed) this meant a long wait in a crowded gate area. Flight was full to capacity and very cramped. Normal offer of high priced beverages etc. offered during flight. Low cost option with more service and professionalism than other LCCs. I would use again.,Negative,Positive

Go First,airline,M Reddy,2023-04-27,"Delaying flights by 5-6 hrs and changing the boarding gates multiple times without any formal communication is the USP of this airline. To top it, there is no sense of professionalism in the staff. They do not seem to care about the passengers at all. While people are waiting to get their luggage checked in 6-7 rows long queues, they would be busy gossiping and staring at the wall. For my last flight from Bangalore, I literally stood at the counter for 10 minutes asking the guy to return my phone and I'd post taking the details and verifying my identification [Not even kidding, he was staring at his colleagues and not doing a thing.] Did not bother to answer my question about a security restricted item or mention the gate number. Then, I was called back at the virtual security check for the same question I inquired earlier. Had to rush back to get it verified and cleared only to know that the flight is delayed yet again without any formal communication. This is not the first occurrence. I had to go through a similar ordeal while travelling from Delhi to Srinagar in October last year where they delayed the flight by half a day, changed the boarding gate 3 times and of course, with no formal communication and passengers trying to figure out any information about the flight without the staff. I understand there are unavoidable glitches at times and there are uncertainties with every airline but there is a way of dealing with it and there's a limit of tolerating this kind of attitude. I am forced to write this review because it isn't just a couple of instances with me. I have heard similar encounters with multiple folks now. This is beyond frustrating.",Negative,Positive
Go First,airline,Deepika Rana,2023-04-26,"Never travel via this airline, first is there for namesake only where as their flights are delayed or cancelled frequently. Our flight was scheduled at 9:15 pm on 26th April which was delayed by 45 minutes then they announced people to be in queue for boarding. After waiting for long they informed that it is further delayed by 40 minutes. Then after 40 minutes they had no clue weather it is departing or not. It is then scheduled for 3:00 am next day. Passengers with small children & on wheelchairs suffered a lot. In Pune airport there is no lounge facilities. Boarding area became like a railway station. No one was able to answer. People were left on their own",Negative,Positive
Go First,airline,3 reviewsS Hayle,2023-04-24,"After booking this ticket I read the reviews for this airline which are pretty negative, especially about delays. So I monitored my flight in the fortnight before my trip. Of the 14 flights only twice did it go on time, but 10 of the flights the delay was only between 20 & 35 minutes. Once it was just over an hour and once it was 5 hours! Go First is a low cost airline so don’t expect to be pampered. You will be herded on at the airport. They also maximise the usage of the airplane so if it’s delayed on the first flight of the day (say fog at Delhi) then all of its flights for that day will be delayed. So I suggest if you need to be somewhere at a particular time (meeting, wedding, flight connection) then maybe look elsewhere. However if it doesn’t matter too much if you arrive an hour or so late at your destination then use them. The plane was clean, crew courteous, a reasonable choice of purchase food/drinks were available and I would use them again.",Negative,Positive

Gol Transportes Aéreos,airline,S Marcena,2024-04-01,"Absolutely the worst airline ever taken, for rudeness, incompetence and superficiality. We start from check in: online, it doesn't work! Oh well, we'll do it at the airport. The day of departure arrives, there are a lot of people who have to leave and they spread us out across several lines... It's a shame that in some of these, the relevant counters for check-in/boarding of suitcases are closed. The other lines flow, like time, but ours doesn't. Nobody does anything. Someone complains to Gol officials who pass by because they risk missing their flight and the answer is always the same ""yes, yes, now we'll intervene"", but nothing! Finally, after 40 minutes of standing still, someone deigns to work. The process begins and finally it's our turn. Unfortunately on the other side we find a blonde lady, both incompetent and unpleasant. Maybe it was because working over Easter was weighing on her, but you can't have a similar, grumpy and irritating attitude. He asks (rightly) for the documents and after a few seconds he stops because my wife, a Brazilian with a residence permit for Italy (which incidentally, she will receive citizenship the day after our arrival in Italy), does not have a return ticket in Brazil. Return? In Brazil? We explain to her that we were here on holiday and this is the flight (one of 3) returning to Italy, where we live, work and live. The operator is not, she is not convinced and needs to find out more. My wife's residence permit is given to her, but as I expected, she understands nothing about it. He reads, rereads, looks at the front, looks at the back but nothing, he doesn't understand. She gets up, goes to talk to someone who probably understands something more about her and then returns calmly and says: ok, fine (as if she were making a concession to us). The ticket includes 2 suitcases each weighing 23kg. We arrange them one after the other: the first 20kg, the second and third about 15kg, the last 25kg. The blonde stops everything again, because the maximum is 23kg. Let's try to tell her that no one had ever given us any problems, neither for Brazil nor for other destinations, for similar cases. Only one of the 4 suitcases exceeded 23kg while the others were well below, but nothing, he is adamant. If we don't distribute the excess weight into another piece of baggage, we will have to pay for the excess! And then everything stops again, the people behind us wait and we are forced to open the offending suitcase, take some clothes, transfer them to another piece of luggage and start all over again. Doubly absurd because if we had paid, the suitcase could have remained as it was, so it was clear that the extra 2 kg did not constitute any problem, but that's how it is. And again, we kindly ask her if she can sit next to us and she nods very annoyed. As if we were asking her something absurd. And what does he do? He assigns us 2 central seats, 31E and 32E, on two different rows. We look at each other and let it go, they are probably the only places available. We get on the plane and only after finishing the boarding operations, we notice that the window seat, next to mine (31E), 31F, is free. It's the wrong company, there's nothing else to say! It's the exact opposite of Azul, where everyone is competent, available, smiling. There is no comparison. Dear Gol, never again.  In assoluto la peggior compagnia aerea mai presa, per scortesia, incompetenza e superficialità. Si parte dal check in: on line, non funziona! Vabbè, lo faremo in aeroporto. Arriva il giorno della partenza, c'è moltissima gente che deve partire e ci distribuiscono su più file... Peccato che in corrispondenza di alcune di queste, i relativi sportelli per check in/ imbarco valigie, sono chiusi. Le altre file scorrono, come il tempo del resto, la nostra no. Nessuno fa nulla. Qualcuno si lamenta con funzionari Gol che passano davanti poiché rischia di perdere il volo e la risposta è sempre la stessa ""si, si, ora interveniamo"", ma nulla! Finalmente, dopo 40 minuti a fila ferma, qualcuno si degna di lavorare. Inizia la trafila e finalmente tocca a noi. Purtroppo dall'altra parte troviamo una signora bionda, con  e tanto incompetente quanto antipatica. Sarà che le stava pesando lavorare di Pasqua, ma non si può avere un atteggiamento simile, scontroso e irritante. Chiede (giustamente) i documenti e dopo pochi secondi si blocca perché mia moglie, brasiliana con permesso di soggiorno per l'Italia (che per inciso, la cittadinanza la riceverà il giorno dopo il nostro arrivo in Italia), non ha il biglietto di ritorno in Brasile. Ritorno? In Brasile? Le spieghiamo che siamo stati qui in vacanza e questo è il volo (uno dei 3) di ritorno in Italia, dove abitiamo, lavoriamo, viviamo. L'operatrice no, non è convinta e deve approfondire. Le viene consegnato il permesso di soggiorno di mia moglie, ma come prevedevo, non ne capisce nulla. Legge, rilegge, guarda il fronte, osserva il retro ma nulla, non comprende. Si alza, va a parlare con chi, probabilmente, capisce qualcosa in più di lei e poi ritorna, con calma e dice: ok, va bene (come se ci stesse facendo una concessione). Il biglietto comprende 2 valigie a testa da 23kg l'una. Le disponiamo una dietro l'altra: la prima 20kg, la seconda e la terza circa 15kg, l'ultima 25kg. La bionda, blocca tutto di nuovo, perché il massimo è 23kg. Proviamo a dirle che nessuno ci aveva mai fatto problemi, né per il Brasile né per altre destinazioni, per casi simili. Una sola delle 4 valigie superava i 23kg mentre le altre erano ampiamente al di sotto, ma niente, è irremovibile. Se non distribuiamo il peso eccedente in un altro bagaglio, dovremo pagare l'eccedenza! E allora blocca tutto di nuovo, la gente dietro di noi aspetta e noi siamo costretti ad aprire la valigia incriminata, prendere qualche vestito, trasferirlo in un altro bagaglio e ricominciare tutto da capo.  Assurdo doppiamente perché se avessimo pagato, la valigia sarebbe potuta rimanere così come era, per cui era chiaro che i 2 kg in più non costituivano alcun problema, ma tant'è. E ancora, Le chiediamo gentilmente se può metterci vicino e annuisce molto scocciata. Come se le stessimo chiedendo una cosa assurda. E cosa fa? Ci assegna 2 posti centrali, 31E e 32E, su due file diverse. Ci guardiamo e lasciamo perdere, probabilmente sono gli unici posti disponibili. Saliamo in aereo e solo dopo aver terminato le operazioni di imbarco, abbiamo modo di notare che il posto finestrino, accanto al mio (31E), il 31F, è libero. È la compagnia sbagliata, non c'è altro da aggiungere! È l'esatto contrario della Azul, dove tutti sono competenti disponibili, sorridenti. Non c'è paragone. Cara Gol, a mai più",Negative,Positive

Greater Bay Airlines,airline,Jennifer Singson,2024-07-26,"Their Philippine airport staff were courteous. The check in system was okay . You can choose your seat if you do online check in. At Manila Terminal 3, a separate line was allotted for those who checked in online. The ground staff at HK Airport were very unfriendly. One guy in glasses continuously berated me in a loud voice as he said I made a mistake in lining up and was so rude in his dealings with other passengers at the boarding gates (whatever happened to basic courtesy and respect?). Despite having checked in online , passengers still had to queue up at the airport as there was no dedicated line for bag drop. The online check in system was a farce, in this case. The plane's air conditioning was not working well too in both trips, as we had to fan ourselves. GBA never again.",Negative,Positive

Ridiculous and the first time I experienced something like this. Almost all other airlines I've been on allows 20kg. I believe this is probably how they make money and this is very very bad and predatory practice. What's more is my flight got delayed 1h 30min from 4:15pm to 5:30pm, and when it was 5:30pm we were still not allowed to board.

Gulf Air,airline,S Keeler,2024-09-14,"Return section of my trip from last week, and sadly no improvement I had hoped for.  The short flight to Bahrain was okay, the longer one to London was poor, and Gulf Air fall way behind the other middle east Airlines. The meal service was so slow and staff again appeared poorly trained and nervous. There is no sign of hospitality in the service.  The same very cramped business class seat in a very worn condition. Again I see another glowing review, and I'm guessing they reviewed a different airline, certainly not Gulf Air. Forget the Falcon lounge at Bahrain and have a coffee in the nice, main terminal area. Overall everything on Gulf Air seems tired and worn out, and the service is lacking. I admit this flight was dirt cheap, but I've learnt my lesson and realise you shouldn't always go for the cheapest option - back to Qatar Airways for me on the next trip.",Negative,Positive
Hainan Airlines,airline,Alan Sargeant,2024-12-08,"At check in I discovered that I could not check my luggage to my final destination so that I had to go through Immigration in China purely so that I could collect my luggage and hang around the airport until I could check in my next flight. The flight was satisfactory and the Cabin staff were professional although their level of English was lower than needed, my food was quite ordinary with the menu generally focussed on Asian cuisine. Portion sizes were adequate. In Haikou my luggage was quickly off the plane. However there was quite a long transit time and nowhere for a Business Class passenger to wait before checking in for the final destination. Shortly after my arrival in Bangkok I received a message from the airline to say my return flight had been cancelled . Attempts to contact the airline were unsuccessful. Soon after that there was an email from the travel agent advising that I had now been booked on a flight that was leaving seven and a half hours earlier than planned and that my stopover would now be more than 14 hours. This meant I lost a day of my holiday though being stuck in an airport with no assistance or compensation from the airline. Some six days before departure from Bangkok I had a minor accident that required sutures and painkillers. Walking fifty metres was difficult. When I checked in I had to ask for a wheel chair and it took nearly an hour to arrive. The flight to Haikou was a little late departing and was uneventful. There was no IFE on the sector between Haikou and Bangkok. On arrival in Haikou a wheelchair met me at the plane and I taken through Immigration to the luggage carousel. For some reason the airline concluded that I had now recovered and didn't need the wheelchair and I was left to take my luggage from the carousel and my own devices until I could check in about 11 hours time. This is unacceptable as it became obvious that while I was sold a through ticket the airline acted as if I had bought a return ticket from Sydney to Haikou and then bought a second return ticket from Haikou to Bangkok. I was in a situation where I really needed help and yet the airline washed its hands of me. Flight cancellations can occur for a variety of reasons but when they occur passengers should receive some form of compensation (even if it was day use of a nearby hotel) for the inconvenience incurred. There was no attempt by the airline to provide any assistance. In the evening I was able to check in for my return to Australia. I was given a wheelchair at check in and taken to the lounge. As it was late in the evening there was little food or drink available in what I thought was a very ordinary lounge. WiFi was difficult, more a result of Chinese Government policy.  IFE range of films was poor and the food was also poor. The plane was more than 30 minutes late disembarking I was given a wheelchair which took me to the bus stop.",Negative,Positive
Hi Fly,airline,J Porten,2025-02-20,"Iberia sold me a flight, on which I was supposed to operate with its equipment, but 24 hours before, it changed it to the airline Hi Fly. I purchased my ticket with Iberia, with the expectation of receiving certain specific services and amenities, which were not provided due to a change of aircraft. Not only did this change represent a decrease in the quality of the service I paid for, but it was also made without prior notice or options for compensation. Furthermore, I am concerned to note that these types of modifications appear to disproportionately affect flights to Latin America, giving the impression that passengers on these routes are treated less than those in other regions. As an Iberia customer, I consider it unacceptable that this type of differentiation is established that makes us feel like second-class passengers. To compound the situation, the staff on board displayed an unprofessional and indifferent attitude towards passengers' concerns, which only contributed to an even more unsatisfactory experience.  Iberia me vendió un vuelo, en el que se suponia operaba con sus equipos, pero 24 horas antes, me lo cambió por la aerolinea Hi Fly, Compré mi boleto con Iberia, con la expectativa de recibir ciertos servicios y comodidades específicos, los cuales no fueron proporcionados debido a un cambio de aeronave.

Además, me preocupa notar que este tipo de modificaciones parecen afectar de manera desproporcionada a los vuelos con destino a Latinoamérica, lo que da la impresión de que los pasajeros de estas rutas reciben un trato inferior al de otras regiones. Como cliente de Iberia, considero inaceptable que se establezca este tipo de diferenciación que nos hace sentir como pasajeros de segunda categoría.

Hi Fly,airline,C Harrison,2019-10-08,"We returned from Holguin on flight 5K2817 run by Hi-Fly. This company was drafted in to replace the original Thomas Cook flight (MT2817). The flight was due to take off at 17.00 but we didn’t start boarding until nearly 17.00. Like most people, we didn’t rush as we had boarding passes with allocated seat numbers. Some people had also paid more for extra leg room seats. As we boarded the plane the cabin crew told us to just sit anywhere! This led to chaos and contributed to the delays in taking off. A storm then rolled in and at 17.55 the captain confirmed that we wouldn’t be taking off. There was no further information until 18.39 when he announced that there a was sick child on board and asked for assistance. At 19.08 a Thomas Cook/Condor plane landed in the storm. At 19.31 the captain announced that the child and parents would be leaving the plane but it wasn’t until 19.58 that the baggage belt arrived to start removing the bags. At 20.46 the captain announced that we would finally be leaving. At 20.50 the Thomas Cook plane took off – ahead of us! At 21.21 we finally took off – 4.5 hours after boarding. The cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything – not even the seating. We heard of several fights breaking out and there could well have been many more. The seats were cramped and there was no leg room. The selfish person in front of me pushed their seat back resulting in absolutely no leg room at all. My knees were crushed against the back of their seat for over 8 hours. There is no way I could have placed myself into the brace position (see image). I pointed this out to the cabin crew who, as usual, couldn’t care less. There was no entertainment at all and the only food offered was a roll with very little inside it. The only drink offered by the crew was water, however, we discovered 6 hours into the flight that hot drinks were available near the back. None of the crew bothered to tell us and we had to get up and get it ourselves This is without doubt the worst flight were have ever had to endure. The whole experience had left us reluctant to fly again. Hi-Fly should not be used as a replacement service again – they simply aren’t up to the standards required for even basic air travel.

On the second leg of our flight, half our group was bumped from the flight for no good reason, in spite of having previously checked in. Again, no acknowledgement or apology. Same Fokker plane.

Intercaribbean Airways,airline,Kimbely Moore,2023-08-18,"First time flying Inter Caribbean and definitely my last. I beg you, if you have any value for your time, money and humanity do not under any circumstances fly Intercaribbean. I checked in at approximately 3:30 for a 6:25 flight. At 6 pm the passengers were informed that the flight was delayed until 10pm. At approximately 9:15 I was informed that myself and another female passenger would be removed from the flight because “it’s downsizing and we were the last to check in. The flight can not accommodate 50 people in a 48 seater.” They placed me in a hostile situation and were upset when I asked questions. I met a fellow Guyanese passenger, who In protest, placed his 3 year old Guyanese toddler to sleep at the check in line at Inter Caribbean. He was destined to St. Kitts on an Inter Caribbean flight, scheduled to transit in Barbados. He’s been in Barbados since 5:50pm today and based on his version of the facts, he won’t leave Barbados until Saturday at 11:30am- no place to stay, no food, no respect!",Negative,Positive
Intercaribbean Airways,airline,D Cargam,2021-12-25,"Some drama on our Intercaribbean flight #410 from Tortola to the Dom Republic December 21, 2021. A 90 minute flight, 20 passengers. Marched out on the runway for take off in Tortola, then back while they changed a light. Then back and boarded. Officious female flight attendant gets her chance to be a star with the seat belt and life vest and we are off. But shortly after takeoff it becomes hot. At first a little then a little more. By half an hour barf bags have become fans. The Flight attendant patrols once but makes no announcement or assurance concerning what is clearly a problem. By an hour into the flight there is an odour of smoke and five minutes later you can see it, faint grey. Alarms begin to go off and are very quickly shut down but Attendant. Fellow passengers react, but don’t scream or leave their seats. But the panic is palpable.  No news from Attendant or flight deck. Smoke thickens and I actually began to wonder if this is how it ends.  Then we descend to about 3000 feet and smoke begins to clear as the cabin depressurizes and we rocket over fields to an emergency landing surrounded by hazmat suits and fire trucks. We sit isolated on the tarmac for another 15 minutes before being permitted to disembark. No explanation, no apology: “have a nice day”. Upon arriving home we sorted out our luggage and found several plastic items melted and fused. One, a tube of sun screen, was melted and blackened, very close I think to catching fire. This was very nearly a horrible end and tragedy. Cannot recommend the Airline.",Negative,Positive

Island Air,airline,G Mallam,2017-09-27,"Honolulu to Lihue. I understand bags get lost. It happens. Especially when we took three flights to get to our final destination, Lihue, and involves two different airlines. We landed in Lihue at 2:57pm yesterday without our checked bags. The employee we dealt with said she would call us once she found out more details. She called around 5pm and stated the bags were still in Honolulu and would be on the last flight to Lihue, landing at 9pm last night. She then stated we should plan to be at the airport at that time to pick up our bags, normally when this happens the airport/airline happily drops them off for you at your hotel, but I told her ok and we would be there. We canceled our dinner reservation, being that we didn't have approriate clothes to wear and sat by the pool, as we didn't have our bathingsuits. Not too long after, she called back to say our bags would be delivered to our hotel that night - wonderful we said, and notified the staff at the hotel. This morning we go down to get our bags and they weren't delivered. We have early morning excursions so you can imagine our frustration. I call Island Air at the airport where they say the driver will be in at 8am and our bags would be dropped off some time today, doesn't work for us. So we drive the hour round trip to get our bags. Again, I understand bags get lost and I don't even know who is at fault for the mishap but the miscommunication or even lies about when bags are being dropped off is unexceptable and then the inconvenience of being put out to go and get them, when we would have gotten them last night is absurd.",Negative,Positive

Their policy states if you book a flight you are entitled to a full refund and cancellation within 24 hours. When I checked my credit card statements we realised that they had charged us for the flights and had not been refunded our money. I contacted them and let them know so they could refund the money. This was over four months ago. I have given them documentation, bank codes and everything they have asked or one could possibly think they would need to resolve the issue. I have still not received my refund and they have excuses every time I contact them as to why I have not been refunded. I am tearing my hair our with frustration. These guys are absolutely useless.

Since there was no on-line check in, and the self service check in machine refused to let me check in I had to stand in a very long line even though I only had cabin luggage. For a long time there was only one line for this flight, even though there were lots of people in the line. Finally they opened one more desk, but check in seemed very slow. The flight was actually operated by Travel Service, with a not very new Boeing 737. At least the flight was far from full, so I could move away from the seat where I had been placed. There was not much leg room, but since it was not full it was ok. Take off was delayed because there was some kind of malfunction of the plane, which was not very surprising. But after a restart it worked as it should. I was looking forward to a cup of coffee, and since this was a low cost airline I expected to pay for it. But I was very disappointed when the only thing served was water and some kind of horrible plastic wrapped muffin. There was nothing else available, not even for money. It is nice to have a direct flight from Tel Aviv to Podgorica, but that is the only reason to choose this airline.",Negative,Positive

After a 2.5 hours waiting in line, we were told that all JAL flights to Tokyo were full and we had to fly the next day and we had to pay for a hotel ourselves. We ended up paying for an alternative flight to Tokyo on ANA and then rescheduling our connecting flight to the next day (at great cost) and arranging and paying ourselves for a hotel.

Japan Airlines,airline,Amy Russell,2024-11-04,"Just flew Japan Airlines from Australia to Europe via Tokyo. Paid for Premium Economy seats 11 mths in advance and chose Japan Airlines specifically to secure Premium Economy seats for the long flight. Two weeks before departure, Japan Airlines phoned to advise that the aircraft had been changed and Premium Economy class was no longer available. Options were to make an already long journey longer by adding another transfer in Europe in order to fly in Premium Economy or to downgrade to Economy. All arrangements for the trip had obviously been made by this time and we couldn't cancel or change carrier, so we reluctantly had to accept the downgrade. Again, booked 11 months in advance, they advised just 2 weeks from departure, and even suggested that we cancel our tickets outright and re-book, despite the ticket prices being far higher given that it was so close to the departure date. We were told we would need to wait until the trip had been completed before we could request a refund. We were also told that the refund amount couldn't be confirmed until after the trip. We were provided with no receipts or paperwork related to the new ticket purchase, and as numerous reviewers already note, the website is useless for trying to manage your own booking. We put in cash bids for upgrades to Business on our return flight, having endured the long haul economy on the way over and dreading the return, but bids on both legs of the trip were rejected. Would have been nice if there had been a red flag on our booking to say that JAL had stuffed us around at the last minute and perhaps accepting our bids would go some way towards compensating - we weren't asking for free upgrades. We get back from the trip after a very long journey in Economy and contact Japan Airlines to arrange the refund as we had been advised then the tickets were downgraded by the JAL phone operator. In short, Japan Airlines has now advised it will not refund any amount, as the Economy fare that they booked in downgrading us was the highest cost / fully flexible fare that equated to the cost of the Premium Economy tickets. This was not communicated to us at the time of the downgrade, and we certainly wouldn't have agreed if we had known that the phone operator had discretion in which booking class the downgraded ticket was allocated - how dare you spend our money without permission? The difference in ticket price between our Premium Economy tickets and Economy tickets was in the order of thousands of dollars for the two of us. I spent ages on the phone talking with different people, who all advised that there will be no refund and there is no recourse. So we have paid extra for Premium Economy class, paid in full well in advance of our travel dates, to sit in Economy, through no fault of our own and with this change being made two weeks before our departure. Extremely dissatisfied with the atrocious customer service and the misappropriation of our money.",Negative,Positive

At the time we fill out every detail on their website there is no option regarding visa acquisition at all. Despite the fact that they send me an email confirmation of my upcoming flight. Still, this airline did not advise me to secure a Korean visa. Still, the ticket doesn't specify that I must need a Korean visa. On the day of our flight, I make a call to the airlines to check in. This is the time I knew that I must have a Korean visa. Jeju Airlines left us feeling deeply disappointed as they did not inform us that we needed to obtain a Korean visa.

When we came back at 5:30 pm there was no one from JetairFly who could help us. After 1 hour finally someone came and he told us there was another plane who would take us to Cancun. Because it was a new plane we had to get new boarding passes. It took them quite a while to do this. This was 8:15 pm. Unfortunately the boarding system was also broken so they had to manually process everyone. By 8:30 pm we were the first on the plane and after 1 hour we finally took off. The new plane didn't have entertainment but because we flew by night that was not a big issue. I know JetairFly couldn't do anything about the airplane being broken, but when you tell your passengers to be at the gate at 5:30 pm, there has to be at least 1 person available and that was not the case this time.

After 2 weeks the Jetstar Asia changed the flight schedule and they want both my travel Agency and The Jetstar to confirm the changes on my flight and I did it. As I checking in during my flight schedule The Jetstar Asia pending my flight without knowing that I have to pay and they charge me a total of 7'600 philippine peso at the airport. I have no other option because they dont want to confirm my flight. I asked them what is the payment for? It is for the Change of your flight. REALLY! Do I need to pay for the Airlines cancelation or Change flight they did? I already accepted the option they gave to confirm the changes but they never specified that I need to pay for that action! It should be refunded instead of Charges! I asked them what happened to my original flight they said it is already canceled.  I am so disappointed and discouraged,Negative,Positive
Jetstar Asia,airline,K Chi,2023-09-26,"Watch out for flying with Jetstar as they can change schedule on your flight and not offer any reasonable assistance. My early October return flight to Singapore was just rescheduled by them from a late evening to early morning flight (more than 12 hours difference). They suggested I fly back on the date of my outbound flight from Singapore (so I will literally only be in KL outside airport customs for 4 hours) or fly back a day later. They said they are helpful by not charging me for the rebooking and no other offer of assistance despite my request.

I shown them the proof I have put the right complete name when I made the original booking and the mistake came from their end. They did not care at all and ask me to pay for another ticket.

What I was disgusted with was that I ended up paying twice - my original payment and then another full payment at the airport. When I inquired as to being able to get a refund for the first payment, I was refused with such arrogance. There was a total lack of customer service. Further, on my trip from Auckland to Christchurch, there was a child who either cried or screamed for the entire flight. On the return flight, the woman next me was coughing non-stop.

At 7.15pm I was advised that the flight had been delayed until 4.45am the next day. After much trouble, I managed to change my flight to the same flight departing at 10.35pm on 20/12/2019. I had to outlay for taxis and a hotel. On 20/12/2019 I checked in and was waiting to board when we were advised that the flight had been cancelled. We were subsequently advised by an ‘Information officer” (no Jetstar rep met with us) at the boarding gate that all Jetstar flights had be cancelled and that we were to find and fund our own way to Sydney. We then paid for taxis to a hotel paid for by Jetstar. I booked a flight with AirAsia to Sydney for the 21 December at a total cost of $679. Today, 21 January, I contacted Jetstar seeking a full refund and was advised that they would only refund $197 because ‘we’re really unable to process a full refund for your flight since you took the first flight (log transcript).

After a successful flight from Shanghai to Bangkok Airport, i was by Egyptair to pay $400 for my excess luggage which has been paid already or else they were going to offload my luggage. I was really worried and had no other option since I was a student returning home and had no money on me.

It's amazing to read some of the older posts here in that they are so similar to our own experience. Let's forget about the passport guard asking us with under his breath to give him our unspent Dinars. When we said we had none left his mood changed and the passports were thrown back at us. The four and a half hour delay was made even more unpleasant by incredibly rude and unhelpful airport staff and the disgraceful snack they are obliged to provide when passengers are delayed. The aircraft cabin was worn and tired looking and did nothing for my confidence in the safety of the aircraft overall. We sat on the tarmac for another 30 mins without aircon in the Tunisian heat. When we finally took off we got ""apologies for the delay"" from a cabin attendant nothing from the captain and no explanation as to why we were left waiting for 4.5 hours. One elderly lady who was a little frightened by some turbulence during the return flight asked for a glass of water to relieve her dry mouth. She was told she would have to buy a bottle at €2 they don't do free glasses of water.

After arriving at Gatwick we were told by the check in staff that the e ticket we had received was not acceptable to them and had to get tickets printed at a cost of £40 (taking this one up with Thomas Cook). The plane did take off on time which was the only good thing about it - plane was old and very worn food on the way out was a stale sandwich coffee offered was cold.

I think if I hadn't I would be stood at the airport right now waiting to go on holiday. I will certainly not be booking with this airline again.

Vile tasting tea with no milk tepid food. The pilots door was left open a lot thus posing a security risk. Had the most terrifying landing of my life on my return flight to London Gatwick.

My friends and I meticulously planned a three-night trip to Las Vegas, each day and night with a special theme. I spent months carefully choosing and purchasing outfits to match each occasion, only for KLM to completely ruin this experience for me. My luggage was not loaded onto the plane from Dublin to Amsterdam, and despite multiple assurances, it has still not arrived. Today is the final night of my trip, the grand gala evening I was most excited about, and my luggage—containing my final outfit—is still missing. KLM emailed me this morning at 11 AM confirming my luggage had arrived at my final destination and would be delivered to my hotel today. It is now 8 PM, and there is still no sign of it. I am in tears. A trip I invested so much time, effort, and money into has been completely ruined because of KLM’s sheer incompetence. I paid in full for this service, and in return, I have experienced nothing but stress, disappointment, and frustration. I will never fly with KLM again, and I sincerely hope someone from the airline actually takes the time to read this and understand the emotional toll their negligence can have on a passenger.

Korean Air,airline,S Huang,2025-02-08,"I purchased a round-trip ticket from Jeju to Narita--a flight that only operates three times a week. I flew into Narita on Sunday 02/02 with no problem, but when I arrived three hours early at the check-in desk in Narita on 02/07 I was told to be on standby due to poor weather conditions on Jeju. Eventually, they announced that they would be rerouting to Incheon Airport on the mainland. The airline staff advised to either cancel the ticket (and wait until the next flight on Sunday 02/09) or take the flight to Incheon. Little did I know I would have to fend for myself. After many back and forth between calling customer service, my booking agency, and the Incheon Transfer desk, I was completely on my own. Everyone involved said they couldn't help me because I boarded the plane to Incheon and that the only situation that would involve any kind of refund would have been a cancellation before boarding the plane to Incheon. But would they have even paid for accommodation until the next flight on Sunday? I am back home on Jeju, but it just cost me almost $200 out-of-pocket costs. $50 for a one-night stay in an Airbnb near Incheon airport, $30 taxi ride to Gimpo airport (40 minutes away since Incheon doesn't have flights to Jeju), then another $90 for the actual flight from Gimpo to Jeju the following day. In summary, due to the decision to board the plane that was rerouted to Incheon last minute, I ended up paying almost $200 out-of-pocket expenses for an already pricy round-trip ticket from Jeju to Narita. Korean Air has embarrassingly poor service and faulty customer communication.

Check in was seamless and security was a breeze at Schiphol due to the priority security line owed to my FFQ status, but this has more to do with KLM and it's skyteam affliation than Korean Air. To start, boarding was efficient, but flight was delayed due to airport congestion. Nonetheless communication was on point and clear, so I have no fuss. Good leg room and meals as expected on KE for coach. The parts where KE fell short this time around was their antiquated low resolution AVOD and this one passive aggressive crew that served my section. Not really major, but was slightly vexed by how spoken Korean was imposed on me by this one attendant due to appearances albeit being a foreign national of Korean descent and having spoken cogent English. She just gave me bad vibes. What was new about this KE flight was a snack station that was set up in the back galley. Flown over a dozen flights with them and this was a first. As mentioned, food was good, but repetitive as the menu seldom changes.

Kuwait Airways,airline,1 reviewsD Casil,2024-08-30,"I must say, the experience was disappointing and frustrating. Initially, we were scheduled to return on August 16th, but our flight was unexpectedly canceled and rescheduled for August 23rd from Beirut to Bahrain via Kuwait. To make matters worse, that second flight was also canceled, leaving us in a difficult position and with no immediate solution for our travel plans. One of the most frustrating aspects of this ordeal was the airline’s handling of our refund. Since I purchased my ticket through a travel agent, Kuwait Airways has taken an exorbitant amount of time to process the refund. It's been incredibly disheartening to see other travelers online receive timely refunds for similar situations while I’m left waiting without clear communication or support. Adding to my frustration, I had reached out to Kuwait Airways on August 1st, inquiring about the last available flight from Beirut (August 4th) due to security concerns. I was informed that the flight was full, which led us to explore alternatives. However, a friend later shared a video showing that the flight was, in fact, half full. This lack of transparency and coordination raises questions about the airline's communication practices and customer service. Given the multiple flight cancellations, delayed refund process, and the inconsistent information provided by the airline, I can’t help but feel let down by Kuwait Airways. Travel can be stressful enough without having to navigate such issues. While I understand that cancellations can happen for various reasons, the lack of support and clarity has made this experience far from satisfactory. In conclusion, I would advise potential travelers to think carefully before booking with Kuwait Airways, especially if you're reliant on timely travel and customer service. In our case this has caused us to buy other tickets by a different airlines which has incurred an extra cost on us. My experience has left me hesitant to fly with them in the future.",Negative,Positive

As there was 3 of us, we just assumed that as we were under the 138kg limit, it would be okay if one suitcase was over. As in most Airlines they allow this. The staff at the check in desk were extremely patronising and rude, they were sniggering at us. And insisting we should pay £95 or they (staff) will have to pay the fine. The suitcase that was over, was broken thus we didn’t want to reopen it and decrease the weight. The rule for 23kg each suitcase is extremely stupid as from London-Kuwait-Dhaka the baggage allowance was one suitcase as 32kg. So it’s not the matter for heavy handling.

When I got to the counter for check in the lady asked me if I had downloaded the pre arrival application app for South Africa. I asked what it was for she couldn't even explain. That lady was forcing every passenger to download the app which on getting to South Africa, no one asked for it.

LAN Airlines,airline,Vladimir Rouvinski,2016-07-03,"I normally fly with another airline, but this time had to choose an option with LATAM for Bogota to Santiago (return) and Bogota to Cali (one way) route. Overall, the service was acceptable but of a somewhat lower quality than the other airline. Firstly, the planes are dated and started showing their age. The inflight entertainment system (BOG-SCL) is not very reliable. The touchable screen does not work well while the entertainment system wired control is in the seat, and any wrong body movement in the seat might cause its acting by itself. Besides, there is no power outlet either. Since I am accustomed to use my flight time to work, on this occasion I was disappointed that it was not possible because my computer’s battery died out quickly. On another note, the staff is doing their work but as many other reviews here have noted it is rather cold and not exactly very smiley. Half of my flights had been delayed though apparently due to the weather issue or airport traffic beyond the airline control. Yet, I almost missed my connection in Santiago because the luggage delivery was late, while the airport international arriving area is small and crowded and there is a long line for customs. Only half the time the boarding is done by turns (according to the rows of seats assigned), when it is enforced is very convenient. What stands out, however, is the quality of food provided on the longer legs in economy - quite tasty, with metal and not plastic fork and knife used. Unlimited and good quality wine and other spirits. However, there is not even a glass of water offered on the domestic Bogota to Cali flight. All in all, I will try to fly with another airline next time since LATAM did not achieve to convince me to change my preferences.",Negative,Positive

Instead of the exit-row aisle seat I had reserved for the Aeroparque flight, I was placed in a middle seat on a full flight to Ezeiza. However, once I landed at Ezeiza, I discovered that not only had the Aeroparque flight not been cancelled but that it was arriving at Aeroparque 10 minutes after I arrived at Ezeiza. The LAN ticket counter staff never provided an explanation for why I was bumped off the flight I had purchased, nor was I offered an apology for being taken an hour out of my way. All I got was a free transfer into the city. To add insult to injury, LAN has not credited my LANPass kilometers for this flight.",Negative,Positive
LAN Colombia,airline,D Ruckel,2016-01-13,"I have spent much of the last eight years in South America and my Spanish is fluent. I went to Rio Negro airport, which serves Medellin, and requested an emergency row seat which reclines, in fluent Spanish. The rep said that she could not give me one because 'you speak very little Spanish and have a passport from another country'. I was floored and finaly spoke with her for a few minutes whereupon she realized that she had probably misheard me. I speak Spanish as is heard in Bogota and not with a regional dialect. She quickly apologized and gave me a seat in the emergency row. Then onward to gate 5 for the 2:15 PM flight to Bogota. It appeared that our airplane, upon landing in Rio Negro, sustained a bird strike. It was up to the four young woman to tell more than 150 people a series of statements none of which matched. They admitted there was a bird strike and that we would have updated information. Everyone was hovering over the small desk where the four of them were. I heard four versions from (translated) 'an hour at the most' 'we don't know' 'there will be an update at 4:40 PM' and I forget the last one. My point is that there was clearly no one who could handle any type of crowd control, nor work with three sets of passengers, ie those going to Bogota, those with transfers in Bogota for national destination c those with international connection in Bogota The woman who spoke the most told me to tell my friend (at 3 PM) and who had a 6 PM flight to Madrid with another airline to return to the desk at 4 PM. I told her that would not give him enough time . She stated again that he return at 4 PM. At 3:50 she asked that I tell my friend to come to the desk, ostensibly to send him on another flight. He missed his connection. I finally got on a very crowded LAN flight at 5:30 and noticed that LAN had wedged in even more seats than ever. I was happy to get on the flight but I don't plan on using LAN again. The woman sitting next to me said that she would be put up in a hotel (she had a national destination with a change of planes in Bogota). She was offered no compensation. She stated that it had happened before but she wasn't really phased; another passenger said that he was offered a hotel and seventy dollars. My point is that there doesn't seem to be anyone , or in this situation, anyone capable of dealing with a group of people, all of whom were getting more an more nervous, in an orderly way. Rather than swarm the desk, someone with experience could have sat people down in the large area at gate 5 and stated the same thing. There was a birdstrike, we don't make the decisions but will keep you informed as we are told what to do, and to perhaps segregate those traveling to other national destinations from Bogota in one area, international from Bogota in another area, and to Bogota in another area. There was plenty of room to do this. This would have prevented the constant swarming of the desk, the yelling, (one of the four attendants was visibly upset, I spoke with her as she was put in an impossible situation), The tight seats were an indication of cost cutting. No water, no coffee, no nothing, but that could be because it was a full flight. I have seen LAN economy class go downhill, seat pitch become smaller and smaller. I asked if a supervisor would come and was told 'she is busy but is coming.' Right. LAN should have had a professional deal.",Negative,Positive

Plane old 767 but in good condition, very good entertainment system and very comfortable economy seat. Paid US$50 to sit in the economy first row but definately worth it, it had tons of legroom. However there are 2 negative points of LAN: first, the meal. They serve a cold disgusting sandwich on a route where the 2 other full service airlines (Avianca and American Airlines) serve 2 choices of hot meals. Two thumbs way down. But the worst part is having to deal with their reservations department. If you buy a ticket on LAN, make sure you do not change it. It took me 3 calls to have my flight changed, the first 2 tries I was given wrong information by 2 totally clueless agents in their call center in Colombia. Finally on the third attempt an agent in the call center in Chile could change my flight. Each time I was on the phone with them about one hour.",Negative,Positive

Additionally, Lao Airlines has refused to pay the incremental cost we incurred to fly another airline above the cost of the Lao Airlines flight. If Lao Airlines had notified us ahead of time, we could have delayed our flight to Luang Prabang by one day or flown one day earlier on Lao Airline flights that were not cancelled.

I showed them my invoice, receipt email and bank transaction and they agreed the payment had been made, but said I needed to pay £131, and the £84 would be refunded. I made the point that there was no reason for me to pay £50 more because their system had failed, but they wouldn't budge and as I was at risk of missing my flight, I ended up paying. Had a very frustrating experience with their complaints team, who also accepted the issue was with their system, but said system failures happen and that I was liable for the full amount. So essentially, LATAM are rewarded for making a hash of a luggage booking and charging over 50% extra at the airport. Incredibly unhelpful staff at all levels. Scam artists. Enjoy my £131.

On the flight back, though, Murphy’s law took hold. And LEVEL,  (Iberia is responsible for the operation of LEVEL) are to blame.  There was no order when it came to boarding the plane. There was no group calling, or preference for those that had disabilities, children, or strollers. Everything was a free for all.

As this flight was operated by Iberia, we expected to receive our dinner meal, as well as some assortment of snacks and water.

I have emailed them today and this is the response to my request for a refund 'The booking was made by an agent, please contact them regarding the refund for the cancelled flight. Regards. Help Centre Supervisor'. No apology, no acknowledgement of my concerns, nothing! My employer will never use them again. Regularly travel and book my travel through my employers portal, and delays and refunds are provided to the individual (employee) who has suffered the inconvenience. It was not the agent sitting in Heathrow for ten hours, it was me. Not so much as a glass of water was provided. No indication of concern or duty of care to females travelling alone was shown from this absolutely shambolic company. Please please avoid. I",Negative,Positive

LOT Polish Airlines,airline,Natalia Sorokovik,2025-03-05,"Our recent experience flying with LOT Airlines from Vilnius to Miami via Warsaw was beyond disappointing. What was supposed to be a smooth and well-planned journey turned into a frustrating and stressful ordeal due to the mismanagement and complete lack of customer care. We booked three seats, two for my husband, one for myself, an additional seat was added to ensure a comfortable journey for us and our pet. Everything seemed fine during online check-in for the first leg of our flight. However, at the airport, LOT’s staff only issued us two boarding passes and assured us that the third seat was reserved. When we boarded the plane in Warsaw, we were shocked to find that the seat we had paid for was given to another passenger. LOT’s mistake not only caused us significant discomfort but also resulted in our booking being falsely marked as a ""no-show."" The most frustrating part wasn’t just the mistake, it was how LOT handled it. Despite having clear proof of payment and check-in, we received no meaningful support or apology. To make matters worse, the cabin crew, while technically following procedures, lacked the most basic empathy or communication skills. No one acknowledged our distress, offered any kind of solution, or even apologized. Imagine being on a long-haul flight, having paid extra for comfort, and being completely ignored when that service was not provided. LOT Airlines may offer pet-friendly travel, but our experience proves that when things go wrong, they do not take responsibility. If you have an option to fly with another airline, take it—you’ll save yourself a lot of stress and disappointment.",Negative,Positive
LOT Polish Airlines,airline,N Levi,2025-02-11,"I had a terrible experience with LOT Polish Airlines regarding my refund. I paid extra for a cancellation flexibility fee, which was supposed to allow me to cancel my flight and receive a refund. However, after canceling, LOT only refunded the taxes and completely ignored the extra fee I paid for flexibility. Despite multiple attempts to contact customer service and providing all necessary documents, they refused to return the money they owe me. Their responses were vague, unhelpful, and avoided addressing the issue directly. It feels like they are just keeping my money unfairly. I expected better from a major airline, but this experience has shown me they do not care about customer satisfaction. If you're considering flying with LOT, be very careful with their refund policies—you might end up losing your money like I did. I will not be flying with them again.",Positive,Negative

Not only is this weight rather unreasonable, the policy of weighing backpacks is completely ridiculous. It allowed them to have us pay an additional 110€ to check in another bag. They should have at least allowed people on a return ticket to fly back the same way they came. But it’s obviously a great way to make extra money which is earning them customers who will not take more flights with them. Additionally the food is abysmal, they don’t let you choose veg or non-veg and they served us a full-on dinner at 9:30 in the morning. The second meal was a tiny hot pocket. The toilets also became incredibly disgusting after a few hours with paper running out etc.",Negative,Positive
LOT Polish Airlines,airline,3 reviewsMakoto Hashimoto,2024-09-16,"TOKYO/NRT to WAW with LO80 on 17 AUG and back with LO79 on 29 AUG, in Business Class for both legs. I took the LOT flight for the first time in 4 and a half years. Before boarding, I knew LOT’s long-haul business class seat remains unchanged from my previous flight. That was why I thought I could get a tight sleep on a fully lie-flat bed despite no privacy around it. Something strange happened, however. The story is as follows. LO80 departs from NRT at 22:50. After taking off, I reclined my seat to the lie-flat position and fell asleep. In a couple of hours, I woke up. Surprisingly, I found my cell phone missing. I searched for it for 15 minutes but in vain. A neighbor advised me to ask for some help from a flight attendant and I followed her advice. In the meantime he came. He adjusted back my seat to the original position and took off the seat cushion deftly. I felt relieved that he had salvaged it from deep inside. It fell through a gap produced while I was reclining it. I aver this kind of happening is not rare because my neighboring passenger on the returning flight suffered from the same situation. Needless to say, I suggested that he ask for a flight attendant. I learned that those seats LOT still offers have a fatal flaw, that is, almost no storage room. As far as an in-flight meal goes, I propose that Japanese meal be avoided. I also remember that a female attendant looked a little puzzled when I requested an individual dinner the trouble mentioned above. They may not be accustomed to taking individual care of business class passengers. No Wi-Fi service is available, on the other hand, the in-flight entertainment is limited. That said, LOT is still attractive in that they have the extensive network in Central and Eastern Europe whose hub is Warsaw Chopin Airport and the round-trip business class fare presented by LOT between Japan and Europe is two-thirds of ones by JAL and ANA.",Negative,Positive

Lufthansa,airline,R Hardele,2025-02-16,"Tokyo to Munich, more than 14h airborne. Legroom on A350 of Lufthansa is comparable to Ryanair. Pure and simple. However they thought a steep reclining angle of the seats would make it better. All you will get is your IFE screen 5cm from your head with no ability to grab anything from the bag under the seat in front. Lufthansa should be ashamed of themselves. Wi-Fi never worked, you couldn’t even connect and trigger the captive login page. They did not try to fix it and didn’t seem to care much as “it is not free anyway”. Well text messaging is free and that’s what 90% of people want. Generally the crew was unpleasant, dismissive, and looked like they would rather be anywhere other than here.  IFE was non responsive at first, had to be rebooted, and was still the slowest IFE I experienced but at least it works. However selection of content was decent with a lot of choice. 5 Had a look at the premium economy section when booking, and considered upgrading. However, when on the plane, it looks just as miserable as our section. There is not even a clear separation between the two, and you’re better off trying to get an extra legroom seat in economy.

Upon returning home and submitting receipts for reasonable clothing, although it was not comparable to my own, they delayed. I received an email from their customer relations that they would not cover the full amount, which was only approximately $700 USD. Instead, they only authorized $460 USD.

Lufthansa,airline,M Budny,2025-02-05,"My experience during this Christmas Eve flight was horrible. Of course comfort of seats is very good. But service was very poor. Flight has started about 22:30. So it was very late for dinner. I think everybody agree that we pay for excellent food and service quality during long-haul flight in business class. This is even more important during Christmas eve. First of all, chaos was visible among the crew from the very beginning. We were given drinks and snacks. However, then the drinks trolley was parked in the middle of the cabin and nothing happened for the next hour. During this hour, one stewardess was constantly engaged in conversation with passengers in the first row. Then the left side of the cabin began to be served by another group of crew, who were very slowly taking orders. Our right side remained unattended for another hour. When the left side of the cabin was finishing its meal, people came to serve the right side of the cabin. However, it turned out that there was practically nothing to choose from. The only options left were some vegetarian dishes, mainly based on red beetroot. Let me remind you that it was Christmas Eve. The stewardess, of course, was only expressing her regret. After another long waiting time, it turned out that other dishes from the menu were found and we finally we got what we asked for. Dinner ended at 2:30 a.m. Unfortunately, irritation and hunger did not allow for a pleasant time during the flight. I do not recommend business class in Lufthansa.

By the time that cabin crew got to row 30 (with another 96 passengers left to go back to row 41), they had run out of choice of food and there was only vegetarian left. I advised that I did not want vegetarian and also advised that I tried to book my meal online between three days and four hours before departure (on four different occasions) and was informed that the service was unavailable. I had the beef in sauce. My food was cold and disgusting, it was so acidic it tasted like the beef had been pickled. The meal before landing a mush of spinach and cheesy sauce with a yogurt and a yogurt bar. The food was hot but mine was inedible. The worst aspect of Lufthansa's penny-pinching on long-haul flights is the removal of the amenity kit. I struggled getting my shoes on in the cramped space so ended up going to the bathroom in my socks. The bathroom floor was swimming in urine. I hold Star Alliance Gold status with another airline and didn't earn a single mile on my two-leg outward bound with Lufthansa. I feel that they are using their dominance to dilute the benefits of being in the Star Alliance (they have already done that with the extra baggage which has led other smaller airlines to follow suit). The only benefit was the use of the lounge which was actually very good. Definitely would not fly with them again and am dreading the return flight - which is longer because it is east to west.",Positive,Negative

Malawian Airlines,airline,G Fairley,2019-04-30,"Due to a recent and short notice government decision to close the longer runway at Chileka for maintenance (which we only found out from reading a local newspaper), Malawian Airlines only other larger aircraft, a 737, cannot be used. So flight schedules were altered after we arrived in Blantyre and the smaller Q400 was used instead. As we taxied for take off, I spotted a trailer full of luggage (with my easily identifiable suitcase on the top) tucked away behind 2 military helicopters. Clearly the right decision had been made not to overload the smaller plane - by intentionally concealing a trailer full of bags. No-one at Chileka advised any passengers, which was quite underhand and just shunted the problem onto staff at OR Tambo. When I told the other passengers about the background reason, they were understandably as angry as I was. We had two onward flights and our bags were not checked through to our final destination due to advice from our travel agent. I really felt for the family travelling to Brazil, who’s luggage was also left on the tarmac. Had Malawian Airlines check in staff advised us of the overweight issue we would have checked the bags with final destination labels. So now, we’re back in the UK, no idea where our bags are and not confident they’ll be intact if they do eventually reach us. Security at Chileka is ‘relaxed’. And the reality is this problem will exponentially escalate as the excess baggage problem continues rolling over into successive flights. Malawian Airlines just need to be honest with their passengers and explain the situation! Nobody will dispute a safety decision but implementing it in a sneaky and underhand way just aggravates the situation. If you are booked with Malawian Air from Blantyre to Johannesburg, or Blantyre to Lilongwe (Blantyre is the middle stop for the aircraft to pick up passengers for the service between Johannesburg and Lilongwe) over the next few months ask direct questions about luggage capacity on the aircraft, and insist on answers when you are checking in for your flight, and take as much in your hand luggage as you can.",Negative,Positive

Flew with the all-female crew and all the staff was great, felt very safe on board, even during landing in heavy wind and rain in Dar. Food was good, too. We encountered technical problems in Lilongwe, the plane had an electronic failure and could not move on, after three hour of helplessly trying around and waiting for an engineer, it was later evening and the flight was cancelled. I understand this is an exceptional situation and a worst case scenario for every airline at this place and at this time of the day. But you have to keep in mind that Malawian is very small. They run only two different aircrafts and they were very apparently not prepared for such a situation. The crisis management was abysmal. The staff was unable to cope, they gave us a bottle of water after 90 minutes and told us they would give new information in 40 minutes. 120 minutes later they announced the flight was cancelled and they would try to set the connecting passengers on a list for the same flight for the next day. Wait, so it's at least one full day of waiting in Lilongwe? Yes, they said that. After that, the poor staff was trying to find rooms for the night for the around 50 passengers in Lilongwe. They failed. Many passengers had to sleep in dorms in very bad hotels, they told the next morning. Our hotel, however, did not accept the “voucher“, a handwritten note stating “Malawian Airlines will pay the bill until $ 85“. Guy at the reception said “They always say that, they never pay anything, this is Ethiopian Airlines“, so cash or no room. At least, they fixed the problem during the night and finally, already on the bus to the hotel, they told us we could fly in the early morning. And yes, they kept their word and we could continue our journey at 6 a.m. But whoever flies Malawian should know that this is a good and friendly airline - as long as nothing unexpected happens.

I tried to call them & was on hold for 2 hours & no one picked up. I finally hung up. After reading all the reviews, I pray we will actually depart as stated.",Positive,Neutral
Malmo Aviation,airline,Michael Kleven,2010-07-27,Traveled from Copenhagen to Corfu. On then first trip the plane had no aircon/ventilation - it was incredibly hot until airborne. Same problem on the trip home 14 days later at 37 regrees on Corfu. But this time the plane had some time technical problems and was 20 hour delayed - we waited more than 7 hours in Kerkyra Airport with little or no information. When the problem with the plane was fixed we even had to do at stopover in Spilt (Croatia) increasing the flight time home with 1 hour and double the hot non vetilated time in the plane on the ground. On the return trip there was not enough water onboard and people had to buy soft drinks ($4 piece - no free water despite the problems with ventilation.

Instead we had to pay $800 each with a different airline last minute to fly between Johannesburg to Cape Town in SA. The customer service is absolutely terrible.

Martinair,airline,P Spyers-Duran,2009-12-21,Orlando to AMS round trip. The Comfort Class seats are the same as the Economy Class seats but one gets 3 inches extra knee space. I bought 3 adjacent Comfort Class tickets for my wife and I for a total cost of $3000.00. Big mistake. The seats were uncomfortable. The Comfort Class seats are worse than Delta Economy seats. I also checked out the Economy Class section for comparison. Same seats but no legroom. It was crowded tall people were unable to fit into the seats worse than a cattle car. Not enough bathrooms. Their planes are relics. Entertainment provided by a hand held video equipment for each passenger in the Comfort Class Economy Class passengers paid 20 Euros extra if they wanted to rent the entertainment boxes. Some boxes malfunctioned. The staff was directed to collect the Entertainment boxes about one hour before landing. This was absurd they could have done it during the last 20 minutes of the flight. I protested to the =Cabin Chief he said it was company policy. I needed 5 extra minutes for seeing the conclusion of a movie he said it cannot be done.=In Orlando we waited for 1 hour 25 minutes for the luggage to be unloaded. Would I fly MartinAir again? Never.,Positive,Negative
Mauritania Airlines,airline,41 reviewsG Mears,2018-09-24,"Freetown to Dakar via Conakry. My second time flying this airline, and both times a similar experience: filthy planes, terrible food, but very punctual departures. I have never been on such dirty planes - it would appear that they are rarely cleaned, even when flying from their homebase. Seats generally don't recline - most of the buttons no longer work. The food generally consists of a variety of dry bread-like items, and are best avoided. I think it is the only airline where crew don't have a uniform - rather they seem to purchase their own, similar-coloured clothing. However, all flights depart and land on time - a rarity in West Africa.",Negative,Positive
MAYAir,airline,Anya de lima,2015-11-22,"MAYAir is the worst airline when it comes to customer service. My flight was delayed from Fort Lauderdale to Cancun and was in constant contact with MAYAir to ensure them that I would be on time for the flight. I landed and rushed to the terminal where they fly from. Their shuttle bus took over 10 mins to arrive and therefore missed the flight to Cozumel. I arrived exactly at the time of departure and was assured by multiple MAYAir employees at the terminal that MAYAir had been told I was on my way and assured me i was able to get on the plane. When I arrived they all pretended not to know what I was talking about and therefore charged me a fee to get on the next flight. No apologies were given, no tolerance, no customer service, and because its sunday, no one to officially complain to. Aparently the supervisor had gone home. This is the second time this has happened to me. Another disturbing fact is that they charge a very high exchange rate for people paying excess luggage at $10 mexican pesos for every $1usd.",Negative,Positive

Meridiana,airline,S Darben,2017-09-27,"Naples to New York JFK. Customer service does not exist. My flight was delayed by 15 hours. Meridiana did not have a representative on sight at the airport to give information. This was left to the airport staff. There was only one announcement made during the entire time. That was only to say they would give us information when they had it. All other information was passed around the room by word of mouth or by overhearing information. Meal vouchers were given for one bar in the airport. This is fine if the delay is only a couple of hours, however multiple meal vouchers were needed to a place which only offered very limited options. When we finally made it home I called Meridiana's New York office to ask what I needed to do and was interrupted and spoken very rudely to. She said send an email. I did this but also heard (from another passenger) of a claim form that needs to be filled out. Why is this information not given by personnel? On the flight bring your own water. The call button doesn't work or they ignore it. When I got up and asked a flight attendant for water I was told to push the call button. That was unsuccessful. Finally I was given a tiny cup of water. This was not just me, by the way. Multiple passengers around me were having a similar issue. Download your own movies. This is not a huge issue but having flown overseas many times in the past I was used to being provided at least one movie. You only get entertainment if you fly Business Class on Meridiana.",Negative,Positive
Meridiana,airline,R Kieble,2016-12-22,"I have flown with Meridiana (operated by Air Italy) from Milan to Mauritius and back. Before the flight I tried several times to contact their Call Center to make a seat reservation - their own Call Center told me several times that the flight is made by Air Italy and that they cannot reserve a seat in such case - this is a lie! They are the same company (Air Italy is a subsidiary of Meridiana) and after several months of calling there I was able to make a seat reservation. Second impression I had was at my seat in the plane. I couldnt believe that the right armrest of the seat is broken and taped up. Service during the flight was : at beginning and before landing 0,15 dcl of water (juice etc) - for a 11 hours flight a great deal! They served also something what they call dinner.  I tried it, taste was terrible. Service has been all the time very reserved without a indication of a smile or interest of passenger. Other thing is how they are dealing with the seat reservations shortly before the flight and onboard. They have tried to change my paid seat to another (but they didnt have any aisle seat available so I disagreed). Later on board I could see a big chaos because more than 20 people have had the same seats assigned - this was probably caused by the fact that 80% have got the seat on Madagaskar and the rest on Mauritius (plane was going through Madagaskar to Mauritius and in 2 hours back). Also thanks to this chaos we arrived back in Milan with more than 1 hour delay. Overall not an airline I can recommend.",Negative,Positive
Meridiana,airline,Robert Bakewell,2016-09-21,"New York to Palermo, Italy. From the moment we confirmed this flight by paying last April, had the sinking feeling it was a mistake. It is almost impossible to reach airline representatives by phone and if you do it may be returned voice mail 24 hours after you call.  Seat assignment process was difficult and reviews of performance not good. Yesterday the hammer dropped. Interminable wait to board our flight in New York JFK, then an announcement it had been cancelled. A sort of Keystone Cop melee to get passengers into nearby hotel. Must say this place is good. We are waiting this next morning to see if they fly us out today. Meanwhile we missed a prearranged day tour of Palermo scheduled for tomorrow AM. So, unless you really have to save money and don't mind uncertainty and a sort of 'make it up as we go' philosophy and a tiny airline that has no planes on back up, fly Meridiana. Otherwise, do not book with Meridiana!",Negative,Positive
MIAT Mongolian Airlines,airline,Katerina Varb,2024-10-16,"We were truly curious how the flight experience with MIAT will look like, after we have recently used a number of different airlines on different routes. The flight crew were kind, however as we discovered with the flight, the professional service level was not very high. Asking for water 4 times and never remembered to bring it. On the other hand, we were rather impressed by the food served. And while these things would more or less balance it to a good experience, what unfortunately dissapointed us extremely was the level of the customer service following a complaint for a flight delay of 5 hours which created a havoc in our further travel plans. Not only we were not compensated by this day, but after a request for a documentation to be provided, which we did, there was zero further response (even after few follow ups on our end). Overall, unfortunately, a big dissapointment from the airline, which also stated in their communication to us that indeed their timeline is absolutely not binding for them. So, you buy a flight ticket for a day and time, but they have no responsibility if you will fly that day or next one, or ever.",Neutral,Positive

Do not eat the breakfast burrito on the return flight from UB to Narita, even the Mongolians will tell you it will keep you in the bathroom. No way to upgrade to Economy plus. Plus they have cut back on the weight of carry-on, so make sure you're either super light or have a suitcase that you're checking.

Mokulele Airlines,airline,Curtis Muraoka,2013-05-27,"Do not fly go! Airlines if you want to get where you are going on time. It is my understanding they only have 4 planes for all of their routes in Hawaii. The planes are smallish (fewer than 60 seats) and they frequently are out of service for repairs. You can imagine the domino effect. One fellow traveler this past weekend told me that of 10 times he flew go! Airlines 8 were delays. I was delayed last night for over 4 hours. Apparently this is typical. Stories other travelers shared included a Best Man missing the wedding of his brother a two day delay to accommodate a couple who missed their flight the prior day due to another unrelated go! delay. A young mother and infant delayed 8 hours. ""go!"" as an airline name is laughably ironic. Hawaii is an island state and as such relies on airlines as a major commerce and social necessity. Air transportation is a form of bridge connecting the islands. Apparently Mesa Air was trusted to be one of these bridges but their performance is comparable to a rickety rusted narrow causeway prone to periodic closure. Mesa needs to get out of Hawaii if they cannot deliver on their responsibilities.",Positive,Negative
Mokulele Airlines,airline,F Schlesinger,2013-05-23,At the time of the booking go! Airlines does not inform the customer that they charge an extra amount of $17 for every piece of baggage. You are however informed of this at the time of payment completion (when it is already to late to cancel your booking). We booked one roundtrip from Honolulu (HNL) to Maui (OGG). At the time of our first flight all go! Airlines flights where delayed by hours some were cancelled (ours was delayed 3 hours). It is important to say that this was not because of bad weather or something all other airlines managed to fly their regular schedule. At the time of our second flight - same as before 2 go! Airlines flight were cancelled ours was 2 hours late. All other airlines managed to fly on schedule. When we talked to other passengers on the flight one can come to the conclusion that these extensive delays and cancellation of flights are go! Airlines business model. Considering the extra baggage fee - making the flight actually more expensive than a flight with a competitor the delays and the misinformation by ground staff I can neither recommend go!

No food vouchers, no aid in organising another flight /accommodation, no nothing. The piece of paper sent me to Swissport ticket sales who then sent me to Iberia. The only flight I could get back to Manchester was the next day. I had to organise my own accommodation for another night and fork out over 300 euros in total.

She not only made me put one bag into another before getting on the plane but she also told me off for that and changed the shape of the gate excluding me from the queue when I was at the very front. Also, on my way to Porto, I wanted to ask a flight attendent if I could order some hot food so she could put it in oven (it takes some time to prepare) and she answered in a rather rude way that they don't serve at that stage.

NAM Air,airline,F Karsina,2020-01-02,"Denpasar to Yogyakarta. I chose NAM Air because no other airline flew from Denpasar to Jogjakarta that evening and that would be a new experience for me.  Thinking that the price of over baggage will be affordable as I read (through several website in Google) that the range is between 15.000 - 81.000 depending on the distance, so I decided to check all of my suitcases. I went to the check in counter, the CS was friendly enough. After showing my ID, and mentioning my destination, the staff weighed my bags, it turned out that they are over baggage - the maximum weight is 15 kg and the total weight of my bags is 30 kg. Then, the customer said that, the price for over baggage is 100.000 per kilogram. Therefore, I needed to pay 1.5 million for those bags. Well, my ticket was 1 million so I thought that the price for my over baggage didn't make any sense. Eventually, I decided to check only one bag and brought the small baggage into cabin. Still, I had to pay 700.000 for my baggage. That's very expensive compared to another airlines. At that time, the staff didn't accept card payment so that I had to withdraw some money from ATM machine. The check in process went smoothly (except for those weird baggage policy). The flight schedule was on-time, not many passengers on the plane that evening, maybe only 1/3 of airplane were filled. No bus, so the staff took us to the plane by minibus (better than walking though, but the other passengers must wait for the minibus since they only operated one). The plane was old - the interior atmosphere was not that fresh, however, the flight quality as good. As soon as the passengers arrived on the place, the FA distributed some candies. We also had bread and small mineral water. It's under my expectation, noticing the amount of money that I've paid for the flight. Since, I was so tired after having a long flight, then I just let it go and slept during the flight. The flight went smoothly though despite the plane 'age'. I arrived on-time, I also got my baggage faster less than 10 minutes after arrival. However, the problem appeared, the tag code in my bag was different to what I have in my ticket (although they share the same name) so that the staff stopped me for a while for further investigation. Another staff came and checked my bag, and let me go. Still, lot of people staring at me - thinking that I might take somebody's suitcase. For security reason,I know that it is good to check the baggage codes, but the staffs must be trained of what to do in case the same situation happens - not just keep questioning or blaming the customer because of having different codes.",Negative,Positive

Nordic Regional Airlines,airline,4 reviewsS Palela,2019-01-03,"Helsinki to Moscow. Nordic Regional Airlines operated flight on behalf of Finnair. Not a great start as it was delayed 45 mins. The crew was clearly tired, just barely kept their eyes open. Plane about 10+ years old Embraer 190. Dirty seat covers, yuck! Service was Finnair's basic low budget concept: Free coffee or tea, or blueberry juice. Of course snacks are available if you like to use extra money. I bought a long drink for 5 euros. With the help of a strong tailwind our flight almost caught up the delayed time. Flight time today only 1hr 20mins.

The crew was so rude, unhelpful and unpleasant from the first moment. We asked to sit together or at least 3 together and the other 2 together, they wouldn't allow it to us (They sent 1 to be at the back). Later we found out that the airplane was half empty so we could easily sit all 5 together. Regarding the luggage they made us pay additional $215 due to 2 overweight suitcases. The crew was pleasant at the flight too and when we asked for water in the flight (8.5 hours) they made us feel we are asking too much. Will never do this mistake again",Negative,Positive
Norse Atlantic Airways,airline,Charles Kruger,2024-10-16,"I will never fly this airline again. It is absolutely not cheap after they get you for baggage. On top of it - there is no wifi on an 11 hour flight. The carry on and personal item allotment is extremely small and they charged me $65 for each bag so I ended up not saving any money. To top it off, they also changed the carry one and personal item bag sizes at the airport - when I did baggage check in - the bin that they use to measure what bag size is allotted was much smaller than when I went to the gate. When I went to the gate, they had a larger bin size to show how big your bags could be and the one at checking was much smaller forcing me to pay more for my personal item which would have fit on the larger bin measurement device. The attendant at the gate told me it was not accurate and turned the bin around even though on it it said economy was covered. Bottom line - if you are genuinely trying to save money - do not fly on this airline if you are trying to carry and reasonable baggage or they will get you on the backend. They know how to get their money and you are forced to pay- do not be fooled. And not to offer wifi on an 11 hour flight is absolutely ridiculous!",Negative,Positive

To make matters worse, they refused to book me on another airline, despite it being their legal obligation.

The ""fasten your seat belts"" sign never went off during the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes flight, and there were perhaps light turbulences for only 15 minutes. The crew seemed to discourage passengers from using the restrooms, making it the main focus of their attention. At one point, I had to go to the restroom, and a crew member opened the rear toilet for me but promptly locked it again when I exited. Passengers had to practically beg the crew to use the restroom, and only the front toilet seemed accessible. It is perplexing as there were no significant turbulences during the flight.",Negative,Positive
Okay Airways,airline,Alex Guo,2014-08-26,Second trip with Okay Airways. This time from Dalian to Yantai in a MA-60 a Chinese turboprop that seats about 50 passengers with 2+2 abreast seating. Flight takes only about 40 minutes in the air. Price was pretty reasonable given the length of the flight and that flying a Chinese-made aircraft means no taxes. Seats bit cramped - I had to stretch my legs in the aisle. No screens of any kind just magazines in the seat pocket acceptable for a regional flight - but that does not mean that there should be chewing gum gluing the pages together! Nothing to eat or drink - no bottled water no bags of nuts. The only flight attendant was invisible through out the flight. Arrived on time. Overall not a pleasant experience.,Negative,Positive

Immediately we called the call centre, who refused to cancel or refund the flight, so we have lost our money. I contacted them through Twitter, but they continued to blame us, refusing to accept that the website had automatically moved it. We are both not stupid people, and would not have independently made the same mistake, but that is what is implied. We have lost our money for both flights through no fault of our own.

When we checked in our baggage everything seemed fine, they told us that we dont need to pick it up at Athens, it will be directly transported to Paros Airport. When we arrived our baggage was not there, we reported this problem and the lady at the counter was extremely impatient. We asked her if she knows an estimate time or any indication when this will be fixed and how long does it usually take. She advised 24 hours. 24 hours have passed and we still do not have our baggage. We tried calling the number they provided us - no answer. We called the airline support - no help at all, they couldnt do anything since they were from a different department. After calling more than 30 times the baggage support number, on the next day some lady picked up. They advised that we can buy something for 40€ per day, but lets be honest, 40€ cant even handle my pants in this resort. Awful service. Our trip is ruined.",Negative,Positive

Openskies,airline,P Challere,2017-05-12,"Paris Orly to New York JFKI reviewed this airline in Business Class some time ago, indicating that the ""Biz Bed"" which pretends to be a British Airways Club World First Generation bed (I doubt it) is by far the worst in the industry with absolutely no way to sleep. The Premium Economy seats have one advantage, they are the original seats of the ""L'Avion"" airline, an all ""Business Class Light"" airline which flew years ago between Paris and New York and provided excellent service. British Airways bought it and made it ""Openskies"", a 3-class extremely mediocre product. The now ""Premium Economy"" seats are still good for PE but they are old, tattered and with many functions not working anymore. The planes are ancient mainline British Airways Boeing 757s (25 years, it cannot be much less) where the interiors are not maintained at all. To find other airplanes in such horrible condition, one has to go to Africa and use the least reputable airlines. One can only hope, it is likely, that the airframes are in better condition than the interiors. Even the blankets (very old BA Club blankets) are dirty and smell. The Ipads provided for IFE are extremely dirty and their covers are in rags. As to the Premium Economy service, there is, apart from the seats, absolutely no difference with the Economy service at the back of the plane or with the most threadbare BA Economy service. The food is plain inedible, even worse than on BA World Traveller services to low revenue markets. Bring your sandwiches. The FAs are pleasant and they mean well, but there is not much they can do in such sad conditions.",Negative,Positive
Openskies,airline,C Worn,2017-04-07,"I am writing this on behalf of my wife and her three month battle with British Airways. On January 22, 2017 my wife and her sister were scheduled to return home from Paris Orly to New York JFK on Air France flight 0032 after attending a family funeral in France. Air France cancelled that flight 2 hours before its scheduled departure and offered no options other than to book passengers on a flight the following day. They needed to return to New York on January 22, so they walked over to the British Airways counter at Paris Orly and bought 2 tickets for Openskies flight BA 8005 from Paris Orly to New York JFK. They were prepared to buy 2 one-way tickets since they only needed to travel from Paris to New York, but the ticket sales agent at the British Airways ticket sales desk recommended that they buy round-trip tickets instead, promising that they could easily get a refund for the second leg of the round trip by simply cancelling it at British Airways.com on their return to New York because the tickets were fully refundable premium economy tickets. The agent told them that purchasing round trip tickets and getting a refund for the second leg would be cheaper than buying one-way tickets. What happened afterwards was a nightmare. When they returned to New York and tried to do as they had been instructed, the British Airways website said would not allow them to cancel online and would they would have to call customer service. What followed was a travesty. My wife had multiple calls with British Airways customer service each time with a different person and was told who told me that the second leg of the tickets the agent had sold them were non-refundable, although the first leg of the tickets was fully flexible. She explained to them each time that that they would have had no need for any flexibility on the first leg since they were standing at the ticket counter at the airport getting on a flight that was to leave in 45 minutes. She also explained that the sales agent knew that they needed flexibility on the second leg of the trip which since the agent knew they fully intended to cancel. Indeed, knowing that he was selling them fully refundable tickets, the agent randomly selected a travel date for the second leg of the trip (February 20, 2017) without consulting them. As it happens, he selected a date on which my wife would not even be in New York to get on that flight because she would be out of the country on that date. In the following two months it has been a continuous back and forth correspondence with British Airways customer service culminating in two letters which basically stated that British Airways did not believe my wife and her sister, and saying there would be no refund and no more correspondence. My wife just wanted to move on and let this go, but after watching this on the sideline for the past two months not to mention being stuck with almost $2,000 in non refundable tickets, I felt I have to post this on her behalf. British Airways should be ashamed of themselves.",Negative,Positive
Openskies,airline,Linda Black,2016-12-06,"Paris ORY to New York JFK with Openskies. I utilized my American Airlines frequent flyer miles and I will not waste them on this airline again. The seat configuration was so bizarre. I had a window seat and I had to climb over the seat next to me to get into the aisle, as it was configured in the opposite direction from mine. One expects business class to have a seat that lies down flat, after all, that's why I chose to fly this class on a flight over the Atlantic.

On the way back, two weeks later, the plane was different and the seats were just plain economy seats with a little bit more of leg room, but nothing like what they advertise on their website. The movies were still the same (on an old iPad with nowhere to put it), the food also. All the passengers were complaining (after all, we had paid twice as much as in the regular eco class), to no effect of course. I wrote to BA's customer service several times when I got home and never got an answer. So I strongly warn you against OpenSkies and their deceptive advertising.

Flight was about 30 minutes late with boarding. Onboard PIA A320s dont have PTVs so you should either bring a book or your laptop. They served an inflight meal shortly after takeoff, food was really not bad.

The outside appearance looked good, the cabin impression was ok but maybe a bit tired. The impression was that the cabin reflects the age of the plane. Surprisingly there was no shutter for the windows. The seats had no reclining function. The flight OP178 was supposed to leave ACC at 15:50, boarding at 15:10, gate 4 domestic Terminal. The video screen showed outdated information of OP146, a flight which was supposed to leave ACC for Kumasi at 10:30 (apparently delayed). There was no info of OP178 visible (also no audio announcements). Only audio announcements of landed flights. Boarding started at 15:45 without any prior info. Bus transfer to plane from gate. In Bus information about boarding procedure (rows 1-10 front door). As rear door remained closed, all passengers boarded via the front door. The flight took off with about 30min delay due to late arrival of the incoming plane (according to captain). Service on board was ok, every passenger received a small bottle of water, a fruit juice and a little snack (some pastry with meat, I didn't taste it). Flight back from TML left on time, boarding procedure is a bit easier in TML as there is only one gate and a small waiting area. No screens but I really didn't feel the need for it. OP179 arrived 10min ahead of schedule in ACC. Service was very much the same but this time with the choice of a sandwich (chicken) or a small danish. Again I didn't taste either one.

The worst thing is they didn't inform the cancellation of the first flight at all and they inform the second and third ones less than 12h. We had no choice to change our travel plan and even had to book another flight back to Lima to catch the flight back to LA. We went to the office trying to get the refund and compensation but all the information we got is to send a mail to get the refund (including their original cancellation mails). On their term and condition, they will proceed the refund within 20 days but my first mail was out more than 20 days, I still got nothing. Two of my friends got an autoreply mail asking them to submit the refund with a URL but that URL doesn't work with any browsers. No one answer the customer service call. It just make people feel they are trying ignore all the refund requests. The reason why they couldn't do the second and third flight is because they had an incident while landing in La Paz but the incident happened on 11/22 and our flights are on 11/25 and 11/29. they don't event try to let the passengers aware the situation to make any changes. This is definitely the worst airline I've taken. I lost my original trip plan, booked transportation, hotel and spend more because of them but they don't event try to comfort us.",Negative,Positive
Peruvian Airlines,airline,James Passafiume,2018-08-06,Cusco to Lima. I would not suggest using this airline at all. They will bump your seats or cancel the flight without any warning. There is a lack of communication and transparency. Nor do they have any empathy. Use them with extreme caution as they are not reliable which can interrupt other flights and travel plans which can be very costly. LATAM seems to be more efficient and reliable.,Negative,Positive

I am a retired US military with basic CPR knowledge and knew the crew showed how untrained they are to render basic medical assistance, another 5 mins past before they finally announced for any doctor/nurse assistance from the passengers. After about an hour the patient was given medical assistance, the head steward was more worried about the signing of disclaim papers than worrying about the persons condition.

Phuket Air,airline,Philip Watt,2005-04-20,We flew with Phuket Air in January but have only just found this site. We must agree with all comments made about this airline. Our outward flight scheduled for 2.00 pm on 18 January was delayed until 7.00 am on 19 January. The aircraft was very cold for the whole journey lots of people sitting with blankets around them. The cabin crew were trying to keep the toilets clean but were not very effective. The in flight service was not of a good standard and we were left for many hours with no food at all. On asking about this we were given a tuna roll. Our return journey which should have left of 29 January at 11.50 pm was delayed until 12.45 pm on the following day. Before we left Sharjah after refuelling the engines on the right hand side of the aircraft were under observation on take off and periodically throughout the rest of the journey. We found this rather worrying more so now after the events of the last few weeks. Our travel insurance company rejected our claim for the return delay because the wording of the airline's letter stated the reason for the delay was 'aircraft rotation' and this is not covered under our policy. We arrived back at Gatwick at 8.30 pm on Sunday and were unable to use our return rail ticket and our son had to make a 400 mile round trip to collect us. We were left considerably out of pocket. We feel that the comments in the press from the airline representative over the fuel spillage incident last week patronising and indifferent to the very real fears of the passengers concerned. Phuket Air pulling out of Great Britain is the best news for travellers to Thailand. The flight problems left us with bad memories of an otherwise very enjoyable holiday.,Negative,Positive

Put on a bus for a hotel sat there for over two hours outside the airport. After several trips to the airport and lots of lies later we were finally told we would be taken home by Lufthansa. Great. Not so we taken to the airport again at 21.30 to check in. Lufthansa had no knowledge of us. We were then herded to check in with Phuket Air for a flight at 03.00. After several more cancellations we finally took off at 5am. The flight was uneventful thankfully. No representative from Phuket Air gave any information at any time. All the news we had of the airline being grounded was from the newspapers or family back in the UK. The staff should be given a lesson in telling the truth all we got was lies and more lies.

Phuket Air,airline,Michelle Koretz,2005-04-20,I have just come back from Bangkok via Sharjah taking off April 13th - 5am Thailand time and landing 2.15pm UK time. We were supposed to take off at midnight on April 11th got to check in desk where they were checking people in and then suddenly they stopped and we were informed the flight was delayed 24 hours till the same time the next day. We were put up in the airport hotel (no complaints about that the manager was brilliant) and given vouchers for food but not for drinks not even for water. There was no Phuket Air rep around at all and rumours were spreading that they were about to go bankrupt. We had no info the next day and still no rep but were told by the hotel manager although it was not his responsibility he would try to find out what was happening and post it up on a notice board. We were told we would be updated at 1.30pm. By 5pm there was still no news some people had been stranded for 4 days at the hotel. We were told the flight could possibly go that night or maybe not for days as the airline could go bankrupt. We were eventually told the flight would be going at 3am and to check out at 8.30pm (71/2 hour check in which meant hours waiting at the airport unecessarily!). However the flight didnt leave until 5am eventually. During this time there was no airline rep present at at the airport at all to keep us informed so rumour was rife. When we landed at Sharjah we were not allowed off the plane while refuelling (is this normal practice) and delayed yet another hour for more maintenance. I would never ever fly with them again after this especially hearing about their appalling safety record and other peoples experience.,Negative,Positive
Phuket Air,airline,Maureen Clark,2005-04-20,Phuket Air on the 25th March 2005 to a lovely holiday in Thailand. What turned out to be a nightmare was the return flight from Bangkok to Gatwick on the 9th April 2005. On arrival at Bangkok airport on the 26th March 2005 we were handed a sheet of paper and told to ring the number given 72hours before the flight was due to take off to reconfirm the flight and times. We took the flight tickets to an agent and ask if he would do the necessary for which he did it cost 200 baht to get this done we were told that all was in order and was even given a reference number which turned out to be totally ficticous. On arrival at Bangkok airport everything was total chaos as the flight had been cancelled but there was no one from Phuket Air to give any information out to us we were left to roam the airport ourselves to see if we could find anyone that knew anything about the cancelled flight. After several hours we were told that there was a bus waiting outside to take us to a hotel but once outside more chaos as we got on the bus with our luggage we were told that we would have to wait until the bus was full then it could leave. We waited and waited and waited two hours we sat on that bus even the police moved it on as it was there too long. We finally set off only to go round the ring road back to the airport. Still not a word from anyone at Phuket Air. Trying to phone Phuket Air but no answer or engaged. Trying to get home from Bangkok airport flying Phuket air since 9th April 2005 finally got home 14th April 2005.

I have a video of that, they put me in Aisle seat so my leg did not fit under regular seat so it was in the aisle which got stepped on a few times by flight attendants and by passengers.

We were denied explaining that they took us from point A to point B regardless what we pair and they refused any further explanation from us.

I flew from Stansted to Boston on 6th August. The check in process at Stansted was a pain because Primera Air doesn’t offer online check for US flights. There is no automated check in so all passengers, including those with just hand luggage, have to queue. Although the 7-hour flight to Boston passed without incident, there were major delays at both airports. The plane took off almost an hour late from Stansted. In spite of arriving in Boston on time (this airline pads its schedule to a ridiculous extent), we sat on the apron for 30 minutes, waiting for an available gate. To add insult to injury, we were kept on the jet bridge for a further 20 minutes. Although I only had hand luggage, it took me 90 minutes from landing to leave the airport. The service onboard the flight was minimal and there was little real food for purchase. Drinks were reasonably priced. There was no entertainment system.

Lots of people had to fly to East Midlands the next afternoon and then make their own way to Stansted. This isn’t ideal but these things happen and at this point I wasn’t too annoyed with Primera Air. However, upon returning I have emailed my refund claim as asked and have had no reply. I have tried to phone them and their refund department do not have a phone number. The lady in customer services told me that they get thousands of claims a day so I shouldn’t expect a reply soon.

Ravn Alaska,airline,S Hasty,2015-12-21,"Ravn Alaska is so frustrating. First off, your carry-on items will all pretty much have to be checked, unless they're tiny. So my husband and I 'short-checked' our carry-on bags to our next airline, since the next airline we transferred to would have enough room to stow them overhead. Then, we took this tiny 19-seater plane, which (once boarding was finished) started up the engines only to have them shut off three times, before the stewardess announced ""something is wrong, the pilots are going to try fix it"" (that's comforting) and gave out cookies to passengers to shift focus. Finally we were told by the pilots that there was a technical issue that could be 'deferred for now', and once they get paperwork done then we can take off. At one point early on, we were told it would be about 15 more minutes, then about half an hour later they said it'll be about 10 more minutes until takeoff. Overall we were delayed IN the plane sitting there pre-runway for an hour. And our next layover was 1 hr 20 min, so when we arrived at the next airport, we had literally 10 minutes until the next plane terminal would close the gate, to deplane, get our bags from baggage claim, go through security, and run to our next gate. Upon deplaning, we asked the ground crew if we could just grab our short-checked bags right there on the Tarmac, they said no. We were told the baggage claim was close by - which it wasn't. My husband and I ran (not a good idea when you're 7 months pregnant and not a runner by nature), he ran to baggage claim to get our bags while I ran to our next gate to try keep the door open until my husband arrived with our bags. As soon as I arrived, I was told to get onboard right now, and when I begged them to wait just a couple minutes for my husband who was running up as we spoke, they said they could not and closed the door right in front of me. Thanks a lot Ravn, for making us short-check our appropriately sized carry-on's,  having technically unsound planes, being untruthful about how much more time we'd be delayed on the Tarmac,  not letting us grab our short-checked bags after de-planing, and not apparently notifying the next gate that multiple passengers (including us) were delayed and on their way running to he gate. It ruined our night and our trip home, and we felt so ripped off by this airline.

It got hotter, and hotter, and hotter inside the plane while all others after me boarded. That process took roughly about 40 minutes for everybody to board. Despite many people trying to cool themselves by fanning newspapers or whatever that were in their hands and requests to the crew to switch on the air conditioner, it was still not switched on. When, finally, the plane started moving, I thought the ac would now be switched on - bot no - they still would not switch it on. The plane spent 20 minutes taxiing on the tarmac before taking off. The air conditioners finally came on about 7 minutes into the flight, for a flight that only lasts 30 minutes. The same thing happened on the return, with no air conditioner on until well into the flight. This is utterly disgusting on the part of Regent Airways. I have flown on this airline before as well, and the same thing happened on those occasions as well. If Regent Airways are reading this, please increase your fares to cover the cost of fuel for keeping the ac on right from the time of boarding to keep passengers comfortable. This is obviously a cost cutting exercise in fuel costs - but this is really disgusting. I am pretty sure all those waving their newspapers and anything else to keep themselves cool would much prefer to pay a few more Taka extra for the ac to be kept on than the terrible experience they get whilst on board your flights.",Positive,Negative
Regional Express,airline,S Wilson,2021-03-22,"I flew on the new jet service this weekend past and I was really pleased - no, delighted - with the experience. The check-in teams and boarding teams at both SYD and MEL treated me like a valued customer and couldn’t be nicer. The crew were welcoming and continued that valued experience through to disembarking, and the ramp team handled my bag and delivered it without worry to me. The in-flight magazine’s page about in-flight exercises was really difficult to read. And I didn’t know it was a cash-bar only, I wanted to buy a drink but I only had my credit card. Also, Manage booking has been down for a while now. Otherwise, a fresh choice for Australians that places the customer’s airport experience at the core of the experience.",Positive,Negative

With REX I finally ""got it"", the Guest Experience. No other airline has made me feel this elusive 'Guest' experience. I've had some absolute shockers, I am now a nervous flyer. Not a heart string pull - try flying home with your step sons ashes and being treated poorly in the USA, which you are transiting through. Suffice to say, I hate flying. This recent trip, I engaged brain, I saw it and was the recipient of their incredible service. The thing that makes airline travel easy, seamless, safe - treat people with respect.

For the money they charge, service should've been much better. Food was average, seat comfort was none. Didn't get any sleep. Plane was packed, overcrowded, and even in these conditions the price for the ticket was outrageous. Because of that virus situation, it was the only airline flying and they knew it, so the price was unreasonable.

I first found out about it at boarding there a girl clerk (not smiling) bluntly crossed with a pen seat number printed out on a boarding pass and wrote down a new one at the rear of the plane. To my complaint she barked out; plane change, when I insisted, big aviation safety guy, who was loitering at the boarding desk apparently doing nothing but entertaining the girl, started to threaten me that he would put me off the the flight if I don't accept the seat change.

Rwandair,airline,12 reviewsAnders Pedersen,2024-10-17,"Flew Kigali to Nairobi for 1st leg of a trip to the US in mid October 2024, aircraft was an extremely old and worn-out Dash-8 aircraft, hardly airworthy. About everything went wrong as their multiple added delays and postponements costing us 5 hours. The issue started from 2 weeks before with a 1st postponement and reschedule by Rwandair. I realised a hastily shrinking, narrow timeslot in Nairobi could cause me missing onward flights so asked them to travel ½-1 day earlier to avoid trouble. They refused to prepone and claimed that 70 minutes transfer time was sufficient. On a further announced delay, they then forgot to adjust arrival time; de facto leaving me with only 10 minutes for transit before final, unannounced added delay. Rwandair resumed no responsibility and in airport they refused my request to rebook me to their direct flight Kigali to Paris as my routing to the US would pass Paris anyway. Thus, I lost 2 days stranded in Nairobi. On the positive side: luggage checked in to final destinations despite not all legs were with the airline. Access to their Dream lounge granted in Kigali; the lounge is fine, but it appears lounge staff eat most of the hot snacks meant for passengers. Onboard, FAs and services are fine, my special hot-meal accommodated, drinks were plenty. The interior of aircraft was very worn, tapes padding, patches, scratches, and everything appeared shaky. Worst was the incredible noise from the propels and engine, making it a very shaky, nightmare-like flight. A last minute, new delay was said the be replacement of a spare-part, not very comforting. Could not hear announcements. The airline suffers from lack of airline partners and lack of aircrafts. The new airport being built in Bugesera seems superfluous and overkill, would likely only be used to 5% of its huge, ambitious capacity.",Negative,Positive

Treated like i was flying on their expense The food part, i am short of words. Security check in Kigali left me wondering if we are criminals. Their staff in the airports are horrible.

First they said it will take 10 days, after 1 week they said 30 days. Cannot trust even a word what call center says. The flights from ICN to OVB were horrible. The line in Incheon airport was so slow, because airlines didn't want to pay to get more ground staff. The food on board is just a joke, impossible to eat. The water is provided only if you ask for it. Flight attendants don't bother to wear face masks at all. The seats are the most uncomfortable I've ever seen. The tickets are so overpriced.

Sansa Airlines,airline,Ashley Bloom,2025-02-08,"This is the worst airline I've ever flown. 2 out of 3 booked trips were cancelled at their fault. Humorously, on the day that they tried to get me and another cancelled passenger on the next flight, their pilots decided to fly 2/3 of the route, stopping over in Tamarindo (before my destination Nosara), and then without any consultation with several of us on the plane who would have happily got off there and taken a cab, forgot to check the sunset time and flew us back to San Jose. Thereafter their San Jose ground staff debated for an hour that they had fulfilled the conditions of carriage (LOL) and staunchly refused to compensate with a hotel room or replacement flight for marooning us in San Jose (and losing my regional booking), and then when they finally conceded, they put myself and another passenger who I had just met in the same hotel room. Of course I fought this nonsense, too. Hard to imagine a meaner or more immature form of conduct. In another case, trying to get a flight back to San Jose after my trip in Nosara a few weeks later, they cancelled a flight with under 10 minutes notice, and thus myself and a handful of others lost follow-on bookings, including two unfortunate French teenagers who lost their $2000+ flights back to Europe. They have now taken almost 1.5 months inventing conditions to give me a refund, which cost me another 500-1000 EUR in forward bookings lost Their leadership is incredibly uncaring, unaccountable and lazy.

When we finally reached the counter and checked her bags, we were told that her flight was canceled and that they would try to get her on a flight at 10 PM that night. We were trying to avoid her arriving in Caracas so late and there was another flight at 4 PM, which we asked if we could add my wife's name to the wait list. After a lot of back and forth, we finally got her name on the list and she was able to get on the flight. While I understand that mechanical problems are out of their control, transparency with their customers is. We spent almost eight hours in the terminal waiting and fighting with SBA to get my wife on a flight that arrived in Caracas at a reasonable time of the day. What I don't understand is being left in the dark for so long. They could have easily told everybody in line that the plane was experiencing mechanical trouble and would not arrive on time. What I also don't understand is their customer service number seems to put you in an infinite loop that does not get you to a human to speak with.

The flight from Miami to Caracas is about 3 hours. If we were more than an hour away from Miami and were having dinner I could speculate we were about half way through Caracas.

We exited and were directed to a very long line where one ticket agent was checking off tickets for the connecting flight and then directed us to proceed through security. My fear that we were going to miss our flight was quelled when I realized the entire plane of passengers was in this line. The biggest reason for delay in Caracas was the lack of respect from passengers when it came to boarding the plane ""Only rows 30 to 20 can board"" meant nothing to people who constantly cut in line to attempt to board.

Overall experience with how they handle this situation is frustrating. First of all, they allocated me to the flight which was not the one soonest available in the schedule, but the one later. Secondly, one hour before departure, they informed me that flight won't be the direct one anymore and it will have a technical stop elsewhere, which added an extra time to overall delay. Thirdly, i was never offered any vouchers for meals, i was never asked if I am ok with a new itinerary and so on. I have to call their support, scroll their website to find info. Person on check in counter showed no knowledge and just sent me to the website again.

When I got to Lisbon on Wednesday, my bag did not, and no one could tell me where it was. My daughter called the agency in Fall River, and a woman said to her that she would need to call Logan lost and found. My daughter then started calling Lost and Found in Lisbon. On Thursday, she emailed Lost and Found in the Azores who then told her that the reason they could not find her bag is that it was mislabeled with someone else's tag if she could describe the contents, which she did. She then called Fall River to ask what the limits of per diem were because of the lost baggage. They told her that they did not know and she would need to ask Lost and Found. Finally, the bag was found in Praia, Cape Verde, but no one could seem to confirm this, and no one could get it out of the country. When my daughter called Sales in the Azores to ask about flights out of Lisbon in case I had to leave earlier than the planned date because I did not have any items left, they told her I would have to pay a change fee. If I did not want to spend a change fee, I would have to get authorization from a Supervisor in Lisbon. The number the woman gave was bogus, and no one could be found. After 85 phone calls (not an exaggeration) and 6 days, my bag finally arrived in Lisbon. Customer service is non-existent; none of their employees (except for one) no anything about anything.

I'm certain she realize we will not make that flight and you would think good customer service would kick in and say if you don't make this flight we will cancel your reservation. We bought tickets for $360 one way to Puerto Rico on Cape Air. On our return trip 8/26/18 gone to Seaborne counter we had no flights. Call the agent again and got the same lady. Her explanation was we were no show so they cancelled our booking. After I spoke to this same person before our trip she knew our situation and didn't even offer any instruction on the policy of the airline. So I spent another $330 to get a ticket on JetBlue to flight back to St Thomas. You would think she would try and assist me no instead she said it was $200 one way for her tickets a $25 booking fees to flight back to St Thomas on Seabourne.

Seaborne Airlines,airline,K Birley,2017-10-18,"St. Thomas to St. Croix. We purchased tickets on Seaborne as part of a family Thanksgiving celebration scheduled for Nov 2017. My parents have several medical issues; availability of medical facilities are a requirement wherever they travel. The Virgin Islands were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. My personal home was severely damaged, our island was destroyed, and most importantly, the medical facilities and electrical systems were destroyed. I requested refunds of travel tickets from both American and Seaborne for the same reasons. American refunded my parents tickets within 24 hours; Seaborne, however, has refused to do so citing a provision that it was not their fault and therefore they will offer a 1-yr rebooking option only. We are prohibited from even selling the tickets locally to someone else who could use them. Needless to say, this is not acceptable. We are leaving the island, we will never be coming back, and neither will my parents. Seaborne had an opportunity to rise above petty policy provisions and provide for a base of enthusiastic customer support and they have squandered it. The adage of a satisfied customer tells 10 people, a dissatisfied customer tells 1000 holds true in this case. I urge any traveler to the area of the USVI who wishes to travel between the islands to use alternate travel modes, there are plenty.",Negative,Positive
SereneAir,airline,Ubaid Ullah,2024-05-15,"Just had a really disappointing experience on Serene Air flight ER-525 from Lahore to Karachi on May 14th. I got to the boarding gate early (around 10:58 pm for an 11:25 pm flight) but ended up getting denied boarding. Now, things happen, I get it. But what really bothered me was how the staff handled it. There were three staff members, and none of them seemed interested in even talking to me! It felt like they completely ignored me. No explanation for why I couldn't board, no attempt to help me rebook, nothing. It was like I was invisible! Super frustrating, especially since I had to scramble and book another flight on the spot (of course, at my own expense). Look, I'm not one to make a fuss, but the way they treated me was just not right. Hoping Serene Air can look into this. Maybe some communication training for the staff is in order? Anyway, just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone else out.",Negative,Positive

Shandong Airlines,airline,G Paksha,2018-11-29,"New Delhi to Guangzhou via Qingdao. Shandong Airlines maybe ok in China but internationally it is pathetic and has most callous and careless staff and is not worth flying. In Delhi this is the only airline which does not have a desk at the international airport, where passenger booking related issues can be looked into and sorted. On my last journey this airline caused extreme inconvenience to me and my wife. They changed my name in their system at backend and on reaching airport I was denied boarding as the name on my ticket and in this airline system was not matching. The mistake of changing my name entirely was identified to be committed by Shandong airlines staff. They changed my first name and denied me boarding.  The ground and city ticketing staff was rude and most inconsiderate with their concern only in separating my wife and me at time of flying.  On return, from Beijing to New Delhi, I confirmed with their staff a day prior for any issues in my return ticket so I do not face such surprises at Beijing airport again and that too in China where language is a big problem. I got an ok from the airline. However, at check in counter, I realized this airline staff had now put my passport number wrong in the system and caused us panic at 11 in the night. They are considered by a section of international passengers only because they are cheap and have a higher baggage allowance, otherwise this is a pathetic airline. Best to be avoided and rather fly more renowned airlines in future.",Negative,Positive
Shandong Airlines,airline,J Xu,2018-11-20,"I booked Shandong Airlines Xiamen to Chengdu. After booking, I log in to the app self-service check-in every day. The result is not open online check-in. Arrived at the airport at 5:24, the airport self-service machine could not be checked in. I went to the economy class counter. At that time, I showed the L11-L15 counter. I only opened two counters. When I arrived, I told me that I was late. For three minutes, I requested to apply for the check-in. If I didn't, I went to the window. The duty officer told me that I couldn't solve it. I can only refund the ticket or the afternoon flight, and I can't transfer other airline flights. After that, I can still contact the official website. The same answer. Due to urgent circumstances, other airlines will continue to fly to Chengdu and refund the ticket at the Shandong Airlines app. First of all, the Shandong Airlines app can't be unreasonable in advance. The airport self-service check-in is still unable to handle the self-service check-in. The same is the problem of Shandong Airlines or the problem of Xiamen Airlines Airport. No counters were added in the case of a large queue of check-in queues at the counter. In the case of my advance, I was unable to check in the airport and Shandong Airlines. Secondly, why can't I sign another airline, I also proposed that the payment to sign the mountain customer service still refused, during which the airport staff of Shandong Airlines Xiamen told me If you go to Ctrip where you can buy it, you can sign it. Isn't this the overlord clause? For the sake of trust, the official app booking is not as good as the agent? Strictly request to return the ticket price!! After I dialed 12315, the Xiamen Airlines staff told me that they were not prepared to refund my money, and I deleted the app refund application without my consent.

Flight was delayed without explanation for passengers for more than two and a half hours. No information was given. It was also not known how long the flight would be delayed. We had to make a follow-up flight, because of the lack of information we could not call and announce when it was coming. According to the IATA Regulations, the airline must assist in the event of a delay. The flight itself was in an old-fashioned old-fashioned airplane, broken chairs, uneven, and tattered. A ridiculous meal that even on an internal cabin flight was a better meal.

The business class (named first class) is of the usual type in China, i.e. 2 rows of 4 seats, with old seats and small reclining angle. The crew was very attentive, wine (Chinese) was decent, and so was the food, nothing special but ok. Reading material is of course restricted to the China Daily, and there is no individual entertainment, but, on a 4 hours flight, especially on a night flight, this is not essential.

Sichuan Airlines,airline,7 reviewsShadi Alkasim,2022-12-13,"Follow travel procedures carefully I traveled with them on the A350-900 from Cairo to Chengdu. Due to travel restrictions in China, there are procedures that must be followed in order to board the plane to travel to China with Sichuan Airlines. The ticket price is very expensive and ranges between five and nine thousand US dollars (for a one-way ticket from Cairo to Chengdu). It is difficult to buy tickets online, and you can buy them easily if you know someone in China who can buy them for you, or through the company's page on WeChat.  If you are traveling from a third country to Egypt to travel with them, you must take PCR tests for coronavirus (COVID-19) three times within 48 and twenty-four hours before traveling in three different medical institutions recognized by the Chinese Embassy in that country, and if the result of the virus tests is negative, the Chinese embassy will give you Green light to travel to Egypt. Upon arrival in Cairo they will contact you to give you travel instructions that must be followed to travel to China from Cairo, and then they will add you to the group of travelers on WeChat, you must have an account on WeChat. You must take PCR tests for coronavirus (COVID-19) two times before traveling in two different medical institutions recognized by the Chinese Embassy in Cairo (they will give you the address, and name of the laboratories, and the date and time of the tests on WhatsApp). The first PCR test is conducted forty-eight hours before travel and starts from seven in the morning until ten in the morning. If the result of the PCR test is positive, they will add you to another group on WeChat, and you cannot travel. If the result of the PCR test is negative, they will not contact you, and you must do the test again on the day of travel. On the day of travel, the flight departs at around four o'clock in the afternoon. You must go to the laboratory to do a PCR test at exactly four o'clock in the morning. If the result of your examination is positive, they will cancel your travel and add you to another group on WeChat, if the result of the PCR test is negative, they will not contact you and you must go to the airport to complete your travel procedures. 7-You should apply for the Electronic Health Codes. You can fill in the information, declare your health status and upload relevant documents online. You must obtain it before traveling, and it is preferable that you do so upon your arrival at the Sichuan Airlines counter at Cairo Airport and before completing your other travel procedures. You must wear a hazmat suit, the airline staff will prevent you from boarding the plane if you are not wearing it, and it can be purchased from any medical supplies store in the Kasr Al-Aini area in Cairo at a cheap price. You must wear a face mask during the whole flight. The company does not provide food and drink service during the flight. Upon boarding the plane, you will find a plastic bag tied in front of your seat containing some snacks and a small bottle of water. You must tell the flight crew if you want to use the bathroom, as they sterilize it after any passenger uses it.

Silver Airways provides inferior service and is fraught with delays and missed connecting flights. The flight was an hour late leaving San Juan. However, it was 8 hours delayed.

Eventually, when we were boarding, someone brought me a fish meal, which I had to eat while standing in line. Then, the flight was again delayed. I missed my connecting flight and had to overnight in San Juan. Beware of their 'so-called' hotel voucher for $150. All the hotels are more expensive than the allowance. More importantly, I am still waiting for reimbursement. Silver promised reimbursement would take 3 months, then made the same promise 3 months later. It is now 7 months later, and I have yet to be reimbursed. A complaint to the DOT has made no difference. I wish I had flown Caribbean Airlines.

We were held in Ivalo airport which is pretty basic at best. On the plane, the crew informed us that the delayed flight was caused by the original cabin crew having excessive hours in the air. The cabin crew that served us had to take a taxi on their day off from Manchester to Birmingham where they were delayed by congestion into the airport. By the time they got to the airport they had already missed the departure slot and no ground staff were available to fuel the plane, hence the significant delay. Now to be fair with the cabin crew on the return flight they were great and really did their best. However on making a claim in December 2016 we are yet to receive a reply. We have tried to call the UK & Lithuanian customer care lines but after about 20 minutes on hold you are cut off. The frustration is you are told that you would be due a refund because of the delay but the lack of response or acknowledgement is just rude. So all I can say is this company are seriously let down by their after sales care and complaints team.

Why not encourage a new airline that we have never tried before, we said! What a mistake that was! Lynx Airlines should be ashamed of themselves for all the stress and anxiety that it caused its customers. We were stuck in Las Vegas because your floor agents do not know their Canadian immigration rules! Before even flying Canadians to the US, you should make sure to train your people and to teach them the rules and laws. 3 months pregnant, I was travelling with my husband to Las Vegas and back with Lynx. The morning of check-in, we presented my husband's papers (valid Canadian open work permit and expired visitor visa to Canada). The agent at the front desk did not let us check-in saying that my husband is not allowed to go back to Canada without a valid visa! 1) This statement from the airline is wrong, a person who has a valid Canadian open work permit, an expired Canadian visitor visa and has travelled only to the U.S. is allowed to re-enter Canada by air. 2) Being 3 months pregnant, this lack of knowledge from the airline caused me so much stress and anxiety that it was not healthy for my unborn child. 3) We had to find a workaround to come back home to Montreal and ended up paying for an extra hotel night and food.

The Chicago to Stockholm flight was lovely, however the Stockholm to Athens flight on Smartlynx is a disaster. The plane has no business seats. The coach seats are as packed together as any aircraft anywhere. There is a mechanical delay, the crew is surly, not a usb or plug anywhere and everything on food menu has cost. I should have packed a lunch from the lounge. At this rate we may not get to Athens today and it's 7am. I give this flight a generous zero rating. Shame on SAS for selling this.",Negative,Positive
SmartLynx Airlines,airline,Willi Sparrer,2023-03-24,"Flight was delayed 4 hours. At first we were put off with a 1 hour delay, although it was clear that it would be 4 hours since there was no plane in Nuremberg. This first had to be procured because the pre-flight did not take place due to the crew exceeding their working hours. The statutory compensation has not taken place until today, 23.3.23. Smartlynx just doesn't react anymore and plays dead. Stay away from Smartlynx, you don't know how long they can hold out for such a chaos financially!  Flug hatte 4h Verspätung. Erst wurden wir vertröstet auf 1h Verspätung, obwohl klar war, dass es 4h werden, da ja kein Flugzeug in Nürnberg vorhanden war.

South African Airways,airline,M Adel,2022-10-20,"I expected the Egyptian check in people to be difficult but boy was I wrong - the South Africans take the cake! I flew from Cairo with a transit in JHB before arriving in CPT. My bags were easily admitted in Cairo as they were 26kg and 12kg respectively. The sum of both was 8 kilos less than the permitted 46 kilos of weight that SAA allows. Yet in JHB the check-in enforcer insisted that I must transfer 3 kilos from the heavier bag to the lighter one, even with a 32kg max allowance sign hanging right behind him. I tried to persuade him to let this one go - he was immovable. This re-packing, I had to do with a long queue behind me, in full view of everyone in sight, going through my underwear and carefully wrapped/packed items that were now dishevelled in order to placate the gods of South African Airways and their arbitrary baggage rules on weight distribution. Both bags end up on the same plane! This kind of unyielding strictness is incredibly unreasonable and poor for maintaining any loyalty you might want to foster in your customers. I know business class gets 32kg x2 for every customer - so please don't tell me this was to save the employees backs from needing a chiropractor. By the time I was finally checked in, I was hot, sweaty and very angry with SAA. The noose gets tighter every year with your restrictions.

South African Airways,airline,Michael Salter,2020-04-20,"I arrived to Johannesburg on an international flight on 26 March 2020, which was the last day before lockdown in South Africa. Due to the lockdown, most domestic airlines already stopped flying on the 25th. This seat in Business Class on SAA was the only option I had to get back to Cape Town, as US$275 one way for the 2 hour flight. When I arrived at the Business check in counters it was like the airline had already shut down. I went over to the Economy check in area and again there were no passengers and no staff. I turned to walk away, and that is when I saw 3 check in agents dragging themselves back to checkin. The explanation offered was that things were quiet, so they all decided to take a lunch break together. After I was checked in, I enquired about the lounge, as this was a business class ticket, however I was informed that the SAA lounge was closed due to the lockdown. Fine, I understand that they need some time to shut things down, but how about offering a voucher for a coffee and a sandwich like any respectable airline would do? I did pay full fare after all. I enquired about this at the ticket counter, but the very agent told me that ""there are no contingencies in place for the lounge. When I stated that normally a voucher would be offered, he became defensive and started telling me that he was about to lose his job. The flight boarded on time. This was probably the only thing they did right. After everyone was on board, we waited for a good 30 minutes while the crew kept telling us that ""there were more passengers on the way"", and that we needed to wait for them. No boarding refreshments were offered in Business. Eventually the person we were waiting for boarded the aircraft, and no, this was not a passenger at all it was a cabin crew. The business cabin on this A320 showed serious signs or wear.  On my seat, the cover for the lifejacket in the central armrest would not stay shut as the catch was broken. We took off about 45 minutes late.  Shortly after take off, the crew made an announcement: ""due to the Coronavirus, we will not be serving lunch today. Instead you will each find juice in your seat pocket."" That was it for the service.",Negative,Positive

Southern Airways Express,airline,Jillian Schwartz,2024-02-19,"On 01/25/24 I was notified that my flight from KOA to OGG was cancelled. I called to see what could be done and the representative had no solutions for me other than to cancel my entire trip a week and a half before when I already had accommodations paid for. When I asked if they could book me on a Hawaiian Airlines flight to connect to my OGG to LNY flight they said they don’t do that. After searching on my own, I found a flight out of MUE and called to book that instead. This was an option that was never presented to me from the original agent for reasons in which I am unsure. On 02/03/24 I received notification that my LNY to OGG flight was being pushed back and I would miss my connecting flight from OGG to MUE. I called and spoke with a representative who told me this was an “operational issue” and could not get me back to Waimea on 02/04/23. She instead offered to fly me to HNL then booked me on a Hawaiian Airlines flight (something I had previously been told was impossible) to KOA and then Uber me from KOA to MUE to get my vehicle. I agreed to this even though it was going to cause me to get home several hours later than my original flight schedule. I awoke to several missed calls and texts the morning of 02/04/24 as whoever scheduled the Uber for us apparently scheduled it for pick up at midnight on 02/04/24 instead of giving us a flex link the tell the Uber when we had arrived. As I am arriving to the airport on 02/04/24 I received a notification that my LNY to HNL flight was delayed. I spoke with the gate agent and she deferred me to the customer service line. After an extended period of time on the phone with the representative the solution was to continue with my LNY to HNL flight but that I would miss any and all connecting flights back to Big Island by the time my flight arrived in HNL. At this point I had to contact my manager and tell her both myself and my husband would be missing work. This agent told me that she had approval to book me a hotel in HNL but that I needed to wait until I was sure my flight was going to arrive in LNY and to call shortly before boarding… as if I am more privy to this information than your organization. Regardless, I called back after the gate agent stated the plane would be arriving in 20 min after we were delayed an additional hour with no communication from Southern via the gate agent, email, or text and was told that I now needed to wait until my plane landed for them to book our hotel room. We then arrived at nearly 9 PM to have to sit outside at the terminal while yet another representative booked us a hotel room and scheduled an Uber to transport us there. This took nearly an hour of just sitting at the airport waiting when this could have been arranged prior to our landing. Once in the Uber, the driver took us to the pre arranged location… which was a shipyard. This was the location that was set for him by your employee. I had to again call and put the representative on the phone with the Uber driver who was adamant that the address was correct and it was not until my husband piped in saying when he typed the address in it also showed the shipyard that the representative realized whoever made the reservation mistyped a number on the street address. Now we are exhausted and that much later getting to a bed that is not even our own. We should’ve been home by now, sleeping in our own bed.

Spring Airlines,airline,M Cooper,2021-11-14,This airline is awful. The ticket does not imply or state that hand luggage is not accepted. I was charged a price for a standard hand luggage bag that I fly with everywhere in China. It fits within the size guide however their sizing for what’s considered hand luggage is 20% smaller. They consider a standard hand luggage size as an 'upgrade' in which you have to pay. On top of this you cannot pay at the counter. The app does not work to scan and pay so instead you waste more time that you don’t have being escorted to another counter to pay in which they tried to charge an additional 120¥ than the initial price I was told. Quite frankly I have never travelled with such a money grabbing airline and never will do again. I’m very disappointed with the whole experience.,Positive,Negative

It got pushed back to midnight, leaving us stranded at a closed Denpasar Airport with no food or drink options. Adding insult to injury, they moved the gate last minute just to mess with us more. Did they apologize? Offer compensation? Nope. The ground staff were okay, but they could only do so much with an airline that clearly doesn't give a damn about its passengers. There were no rescheduling options, and refunds are supposed to take 90 days. When we finally got on the plane, it was like stepping into a time machine—straight to an aircraft museum. The seats were just okay, but there was no in-flight entertainment. Snacks were there, but they didn't make up for the overall misery. We landed at 01:30AM Jakarta time in a remote parking spot. Then, in drizzling rain, we had to deplane using stairs without umbrellas and walk to the arrival terminal. I'd recommend to avoid NAM and Sriwijaya Air like the plague.

I was booked a flight PHX -> MSP -> MCO by my employer. The flight to MSP was delayed over an hour due to a ""controllable error"" on behalf of Sun Country which caused me to miss my connecting flight to MCO. There was another Sun Country flight to MCO from the same terminal. I was denied access to this flight because the attendant ""wasn't allowed to rebook at the gate."" The flight took off with empty seats in it and me stuck in MSP. I was told my checked bag was at MCO by Sun Country representatives. I would later come to find this was a lie. I was offered a rebook that would have me landing at MCO 14 hours after the original flight's landing; this was not an option as I had my brother's wedding to attend as his best man. I was refused all options to be rebooked on a different airline despite the fact that I was inconvenienced by Sun Country on a mistake that was solely their fault. I accepted a voucher for the cost of the flight and figured my employer could keep the voucher and pay me the cost of a rebook with Frontier. I rebooked with Frontier and then was informed, moments before boarding my new flight, that my bag was in MSP. Apparently, without my consent, the bag was refunded as well and left sitting in MSP without my knowledge - I only learned because I was called by a Sun Country representative while at the gate to depart with Frontier. Sun Country refused to send my bag to Orlando using the voucher. I had to leave the terminal, grab my bag, check it and pay it out-of-pocket to Frontier, and then get back to my gate before departure.

Basically every they on the morning they text me that luggage will be with me on evening, but it never happened. I flew back to UK without my luggage. I done my clime 6 days ago, and is still awaiting for any response. I tried to chat with them, but they only can say that they busy.",Neutral,Positive

SunExpress,airline,A Davies,2024-08-31,"Flight times were good so with our 2x young children, we went for it. Seat Reservation prices are reasonable but getting their website or app (pick your poison) to take the payment was very difficult. In the end, it took the payment 4 times (it was refunded to be fair but the system is poor to say the least). This proved a wise choice as in the outbound flight, there was a huge amount of negotiation going on among passengers trying to swap seats so that their children (some quite young) could be sat with a parent ... this is quite unacceptable for the airline to not manage that better and I myself ended up swapping seats (that I'd paid for!) and being away from my wife and kids so that someone else could sit with their 2x kids. Delayed for 1hr on the tarmac at LGW for departure with no communication or updates from the crew, not great. Plane itself was OK. Felt safe but it was quite worn, wobbly seat and no seat pockets. Drinks service was OK. On our return, same issues with the online seat reservation (had to eventually call the airline to get the payment to work and was told it was a common IT issue). The whole payment saga and duplicate charge attempts whilst overseas resulted in one of my bank cards being frozen... that was fun. Flight back was relatively good. Antalya Airport is a bit of a shambles so it was quite amazing really that we took off almost on time. No boarding by groups though so everyone boards in the wrong order, inefficient to say the least and not managed whatsoever. Again, plane seemed quite worn but was generally clean. No in flight entertainment either way. Overall, it was OK. Sometimes you get what you pay for so personally, we will probably try another airline next time.",Negative,Positive
SunExpress,airline,C Lansen,2024-08-10,"The check in was the worst of all with Sunexpress. Only the tour operator pointed out in small print that costs would be incurred if you did not check in online. In order to actually get your booking, there are several obstacles in which if you can't see, e.g. that you can only find the flight if you search through tour operators and an unclear error occurs. So you have to pay money again at check-in because you couldn't do it yourself. Then seat selection is actually not necessary, but it is written that it is necessary and as soon as you click on something it stays logged in even if you go completely out of the form. Old tricks that make people less and less able to trust third parties. Then you have to make sure that the boarding pass is downloaded on the last website because it would be too difficult to email it to you. For 2 people the same name of the file can lead to misunderstandings and you can then email this back to yourself manually so that you have the boarding pass on site. Water on the airplane costs money.",Positive,Negative
Sunwing Airlines,airline,Ian Sutton,2024-03-02,I had a medical emergency while in Cuba and Sunwing was 200$ more than air transit and Air Canada when they found out those 2 airlines were full. They were not on time and the seats were so hard. There was no food but pretzels. When we landed we had to take a 10 minute bus ride to the terminal. Then wait an hour for our luggage. So disappointed in the service. Westjet used to be so good.,Negative,Positive
Sunwing Airlines,airline,L Balani,2024-01-23,"The issue arose on the last day of our trip during the check-in for our return flight. Our seats, initially assigned to row 13, were unexpectedly reassigned to row 28 without any prior notice or explanation. Despite our efforts to resolve the matter with a supervisor, it was revealed that someone had paid for our seats, resulting in our displacement. What right do SunWing have to sell our seats? I argued that I wanted to buy my seats back or I should get compensation for selling my seats. The situation escalated further when an agent abruptly ripped our boarding passes. After I was able to de-escalate the situation since other family members were involved, our boarding passes were reprinted. To our shock, upon reaching the airport security checkpoint, we were surrounded by police who informed us that we would not be allowed on the plane. The reason given to other family members was that SunWing had overbooked the flight, a fact was unknown to us until our return to Canada. Upon seeking clarification from SunWing agents, the agents refused to engage with us. Another unnamed agent accused us of posing a safety threat to an international flight, threatening to involve the police and even mentioning potential imprisonment, invoking the specter of terrorism. Attempts to record the conversation were met with threats of arrest. In the end, we were forced to rebook our flights by ourselves for the following day. The subsequent travel with WestJet was uneventful, emphasizing that the issues were specific to our interactions with SunWing. This experience was deeply traumatizing for my family and me. Selling our seats to make extra profit at the expense of compromising the comfort and safety of my family is unacceptable. Having a group of agents controlling who boards the flight is not only unacceptable but must be dealt with immediately. We have been traveling for many years with no concerns, as a Canadian, I shouldn't feel like a criminal in a foreign country, especially by agents representing a privately owned Canadian company.",Negative,Positive

Another 2 hours on the tarmac. I am not a fuzzy eater and I just couldn't eat the beef rice - a concoction that tasted like plastic. My travel companion opted for the pork noodles - also he couldn't eat his meal. plane is fairly new - a Boeing 737-800 with personal TV screens (the first I've seen on a Chinese domestic airline) but they didn't work, so no inflight entertainment during our delay as well as for the duration of the flight. The tray tables were dirty and sticky. No magazine or safety card in my seat pocket. The cabin crew was friendly and fairly patient (although tired looking) dealing with the angry passengers. Also good English skills from both the cabin crew as well as the captain.  Seat pitch is good, even for me (6'2 tall) - better than most domestic airlines in China.

Swiss Intl Air Lines,airline,Jesper Thornhage,2025-01-29,"Extremely Disappointed with Swiss Air’s Customer Service. I am deeply disappointed with the way Swiss Air has handled our case regarding an involuntary rebooking that resulted in significant extra costs for us. Instead of acknowledging their responsibility and following EU regulations, Swiss Air has chosen to repeatedly send out automated responses, ignore our legitimate claims, and refer to their own internal policies rather than the actual passenger rights and laws that protect consumers. We had booked a flight with Swiss Air from Landvetter, including pre-booked ski baggage. The night before departure—less than 10 hours before our flight—we were suddenly rebooked via SAS with a connection in Arlanda. This last-minute change completely disrupted our travel plans, causing two major financial burdens: 1. Missed Transfer: Because of the rebooking, we arrived at our destination later than scheduled and missed our pre-booked airport transfer. As a result, we had to arrange and pay for a new transfer at the last minute, costing us 3,000 SEK. 2. Unavoidable Baggage Fee: When checking in our ski baggage at SAS, we were charged 3,000 SEK because the bag was not pre-booked. Swiss Air’s rebooking happened so late that we had no opportunity to pre-book the baggage ourselves, as SAS requires this to be done at least 24 hours before departure. Swiss Air’s Completely Unacceptable Response Despite presenting clear evidence of these additional costs, Swiss Air has: • Paid us a completely inadequate 1,400 SEK, which does not even come close to covering our out-of-pocket expenses. • Ignored EU regulations and international conventions that protect passengers from financial losses caused by involuntary rebookings. • Repeatedly responded with generic, automated emails that dismiss our claims without proper evaluation. • Refused to take responsibility, instead hiding behind their own policy, which conveniently benefits the airline rather than following established passenger rights laws. What Swiss Air Should Have Done Under EU Regulation 261/2004, Montreal Convention (Article 19), and basic consumer rights, Swiss Air is legally obligated to reimburse passengers for additional costs caused by rebookings. This is not just a question of customer service—it is a legal responsibility that Swiss Air is actively choosing to ignore. This entire experience has shown that Swiss Air does not care about its customers. They are more concerned with protecting their own financial interests than treating passengers fairly. Instead of dealing with legitimate claims responsibly, they rely on delaying tactics, generic responses, and outright refusal to comply with international laws. We will not let this go. To all travelers: think twice before booking with Swiss Air. If anything goes wrong, do not expect them to take responsibility—you will be left dealing with a corporate wall of silence, generic responses, and disregard for passenger rights. Absolutely disgraceful behavior from an airline that claims to be premium.",Negative,Positive
Swiss Intl Air Lines,airline,Laurie Lavail,2025-01-04,"Shameful customer service. Flight was ok but my luggage was somehow lost in the process and delivered to final destination after a couple of days. I was on holidays, thus bought the basic necessities on the day of my arrival, so my son and I had something to wear in this lapse of time. The treatment of my refund claim by Swiss Airlines has been mediocre. To start with, it took me 3 attempts to file the claim via their website, although all 3 claims were done in the exact same way, before it was finally acknowledged by email. In the meantime, I also tried to reach Swiss customer service by phone, trying 5 different phone numbers, each person redirecting me to a different internal department, which seems to be the only thing at which Swiss excels. As this led nowhere, I filed a complaint with Lufthansa. This too was unsuccessful, as the company rightly stated that the flight was operated by Swiss Airline and that it was up to them to sort out the problem. Despite my email reminders, there has been no follow-up on my claim (although I do have a claim, reference number 2410-LX-03571). I phoned Swiss customer service, who told me that it was impossible to deal with requests other than buying tickets over the phone, and that they couldn't transfer me internally as there was no competent department able to manage my claim (?!). I'm astounded by the non-existence (and on the rare occasions when I've managed to speak to someone, incompetence) of Swiss Airlines customer service. Until now, I have been unable to take my case any further with them, either by email or by telephone.

SyrianAir,airline,T Lloyd,2009-11-25,I tried to arrange a group trip with SyrianAir from London to Aleppo via Damascus and back. Initially all was fine until they cancelled the first leg of the journey to Damascus a week prior to us leaving. The next flight was 2 days later but there was no immediate plane to Aleppo once we had arrived at Damascus which meant we would have to take a bus up instead a journey we weren't too keen on. While friendly the staff are fairly useless and I sat for MANY hours trying to sort things out. We changed the flights to stay the same number of days but decided to go to Aleppo at the tail end of the trip under our own steam and the fly Allepo to London (again via Damascus) on the same ticket. Unfortunately the staff didn't really get the 'group' concept and kept issuing tickets for the wrong dates for different members of the group. It took too many visits to their offices in Baker Street to finally get everyone on the same flights at the same time. The flight to Syria was fine (late) and we managed to get up to Aleppo ourselves but the day before we were to fly out again we went into the Syrian air offices to confirm everything was ok. IT WAS NOT. They had cancelled the flight to Damascus without informing any of us and we had to arrange a midnight bus from Aleppo to Damascus Airport to make the correct flight back to London. Luckily this one hadn't been cancelled. But it was late. My advice: Don't Fly SyrianAir and if you do check on your flights constantly.,Negative,Positive
SyrianAir,airline,John Doe,2009-10-23,"Daytrip to Aleppo on day one outbound was a domestic leg of an international flight that continued to Stockholm. Aircraft was filthy but on time. Was quite concerned when airline staff took our passports to be returned in Aleppo - to identify domestic passengers or give us an incentive not to stay onboard for the long flight to Sweden (and civilisation). Return was on decades-old Tupolev 134 although this aircraft was very clean. Day two was a round trip on the same aircraft to Deirezzor and back to fly on a Yak 40 (very unusual old Russian commuter jetliner gone from service everywhere else in the world). While the Yak was a novelty I am sure for a regular airline passenger it would be quite scary as the plane was in fairly poor condition. Our flight unlike the previous day's ALP/ARN service left from the domestic terminal a real third world mess with puddles of water and ash on the floor no signs or shops or anything. Smoking was encouraged though. On arrival at Deirezzor my travel partner and I were arrested because (we assume) it was unusual for pax to fly-and-return in the same morning. Released and allowed to rejoin the flight back to Damascus but on arrival back at DAM were arrested again and spent the entire day being interviewed by scary ""security"" officials who were not only sinister but also incompetent eg: photocopied our passports but inadvertently gave us the photocopy then searching their own paperwork for the photocopies etc. Perhaps our travel plans were out of the ordinary but if it was an itinerary unfavourable to Syrian security concerns why sell us the ticket in the first place? Eventually released shaken. Day three was a day trip to Latakia beach resort. Old Yak 40 again shabby service smoking cabin crew smoking refuellers etc. Waiting at small Latakia airport for return to DAM many plainclothes cops pacing like circling sharks due to a VIP passenger. Same at international departures (TK to IST and on to LHR) - circling security agents in shiny suits everywhere hanging ceiling panels frayed wires broken luggage belts broken destination indicators with hand-written signs taped over them (complete with spelling mistakes! our flight was to Astanbul). Never been so happy to leave a country. Some of this doesn't relate to Syrianair but our troubles revolved around the Deirezzor flights which again Syrianair were quite happy to sell us.

SyrianAir,airline,Rob Butler,2007-08-06,London - Damascus in Business/First. Rather a traumatic experience! The aircraft was an ancient 747; with business class (they call it First) upstairs. First shock - nowhere to store your hand luggage. So the bags just sit on the floor around you - able to hurtle towards passengers as soon as there is any turbulence. Late take off with absolutely no explanation - apparently this is a frequent occurrence. The meal service was OK but not very sophisticated. Food laid out on one large trolley and served by reasonably friendly staff. Mix of western and Arab dishes. Poached salmon which was fine. No desserts but plenty of fresh fruit. Seats were well past their sell-by dates. Reasonable recline but nothing like a flat bed. No IFE. And I mean none - not even a big screen movie. No reading material either. So if you have to go to Damascus and want some cheap leg room it's fine but don't expect any bells and whistles.,Negative,Positive
T'Way Air,airline,J Garlinas,2025-02-26,"My recent experience with T'way Air was extremely disappointing. On February 7, 2025, my flight from Jeju to Gimpo was canceled due to adverse weather conditions. While I understand this was beyond the airline's control, T'way provided no assistance or compensation for additional accommodation and meal expenses. The following day, February 8, my rescheduled flight suffered a significant delay, causing me to miss my international connection in Seoul. This resulted in substantial additional expenses, including a new flight ticket, ground transportation, and accommodation. Most frustrating was the complete lack of customer service and support from T'way. There was no attempt to help or compensate for the inconveniences caused. Communications were non-existent and, when I finally managed to contact them, they were unwilling to collaborate or offer solutions. As a student, these unforeseen expenses have had a significant financial impact. The lack of empathy and professionalism shown by T'way Air has been deeply disappointing.

T'Way Air,airline,Natalia Smith,2024-06-30,"Complaint letter to T Way CEO Jeong Hong-Geun. I am a frequent international flier. This summer, my family of 8, including my kids, who are 9 and 6 years old, decided to visit Busan. I bought 8 tickets from Tway Airlines. Our departing flight from Gimpo airport was at 6.50 am on June 24, 2024. After we arrived at the airport, we were trying to self-check in but we got confused and we decided to go straight to one of your Tway customer representative agents, (we arrived early and there was no line).  Me and my sister, who speaks Korean, approached your representative, and gave her our passports. She looked very annoyed and unfriendly. It didn’t bother us at first. Then she rudely told us to do self-check in because she doesn't issue boarding passes. I was trying to explain to her, with the help of my sister, that  I got confused with the options at the self-check machine. In my response, she impolitely asked me my last name and a departure time. Then she almost  threw our passports and rudely told us that our flight was booked to Jejudo, not to Busan. I went back to the self-check-in kiosk and printed our boarding passes. I ended up returning to the same girl (not by my choice). Again, she was irritable with a lot of attitude, and with great reluctance started to check everyone's passports. Then she angrily stated that me and my two kids can’t go to Busan because  I didn’t write our middle names on our tickets. We never use our middle names when we buy international tickets. We often visit Korea  and coming to Seoul from the USA was never a problem.   I mentioned this to her. Instead of assisting us, she raised her voice, frowned her face  and yelled “NO!  You can’t go! You must buy new tickets!” She threw me our passports and sent us away. I was so shocked to believe that this could happen in Korea.  How disrespectful, how aggressively we were treated!? I didn’t know what to do because she didn’t want to help us, so I ended up going upstairs for a security check. They didn’t let me go in, but they politely explained that I had to return back, and a Tway agent would fix it for us. Again, I took my kids downstairs, and another Tway representative was able to help us. She kindly wrote our middle names and put stamps on our boarding passes. I wanted to talk to a manager to inform of rude behavior, but at that time, nobody was available. On July 28,2024, we had a return flight. At Gimhae Airport one of the Tway agents wrote our middle names and put stamps on boarding passes  with no questions asked. We landed at Gimpo at  9:40 am.  We got off the airport bus, and I saw the same staff member again. I told her that I would take a picture of her ID card, and then I went downstairs to claim my luggage. She followed me downstairs, aggressively approached me, and  shoved her cellphone right in my face. It was written on the screen in English “I told you several times..!” I literally could not believe what  was happening. I thought she was going to fight with me.  I was threatened. I was so shocked with this attitude. Never in my life have I experienced this kind of treatment before. This was my first and the last flight with tway!",Negative,Positive

TAAG Angola Airlines,airline,Kaarina Shilula,2024-12-14,"My experience with TAAG Angola Airlines has been nothing short of a nightmare. Not only did they lose my luggage, but their subsequent handling of the situation has been appalling and deeply frustrating. The trouble started when TAAG failed to notify me that they had stopped operating flights between Luanda and Madrid, even though I had a booked ticket. This left me scrambling to book a new flight through Lisbon at my own expense just to continue my journey. To make matters worse, my luggage was lost due to this disruption, and the airline has shown no sense of urgency or accountability in resolving the issue. I flew at the end of July, and it has now been six months without any resolution. Instead, after weeks of silence, I was sent a generic apology email blaming ""currency devaluation"" for their inability to offer monetary compensation. They proposed a travel voucher worth $396 instead, completely ignoring the fact that the value of my lost belongings far exceeds this amount. This lack of accountability is unacceptable, especially since many of the items in my luggage belonged to other people, and I am now left to compensate them out of my own pocket. I made it clear that I am willing to accept the amount offered, but only in monetary form. Despite this, TAAG has continued to ignore my claim and failed to uphold their responsibility. They eventually sent me a claim form which I submitted two months ago and have followed up twice to check the progress of my refund, yet I have received no response or compensation. TAAG Angola Airlines has demonstrated an utter lack of professionalism, communication, and care for their customers. Their inability to resolve complaints in a timely and satisfactory manner, coupled with their disregard for passenger trust, makes it clear that they are not a reliable airline. I would strongly advise against flying with TAAG Angola Airlines. If they lose your luggage or disrupt your plans, do not expect them to take responsibility or provide a meaningful resolution. This airline does not value its passengers or honor its commitments.",Negative,Positive
TAAG Angola Airlines,airline,Johanna Engelbrecht,2024-12-04,"We were supposed to fly on Thursday at 16:40, but Charlie, my miniature French Poodle, was checked in at 9:00. Our flight was cancelled due to issues with the plane. TAAG handled it well. I was booked into a hotel and flew the next day (Friday). Charlie, however, had to stay behind. He could only fly on Monday, as TAAG doesn't take animals over weekends etc. I had to pay for after-hours pickup and the nights he stayed. I kept in touch the whole weekend. Charlie was checked in on Monday morning. I kept in touch. We were supposed to pick him up in Lisbon at 12:00 on Tuesday. I messaged in the morning to check up on his whereabouts. I was told he was on the plane and that I should speak to the customs agent, which I did. I was told Charlie's vet check is at 10:00, and I will get more information then. Halfway on our way from Lagos to Lisbon, I received a message from the customs agent that Charlie was not in Lisbon. According to the travel agent's tracking, he was in Lisbon, but according to the customs agent, he was not. Charlie was eventually located. He was in Luanda, left behind. The plane had a technical issue and was delayed, Charlie was then forgotten and just not put on the flight. No proper explanation, no informing of the freight agent, pet travelling agent, or customs agent. Charlie was then put on the next flight after numerous calls etc and arrived in Lisbon Tuesday at 8:45 p.m. We were told that we could only pick him up on Wednesday at 12:00. Charlie is 9 months old and very anxious after this ordeal. He is not leaving my side. Besides all the additional and unnecessary expenses due to Taag, no communication from them.",Negative,Positive
TAAG Angola Airlines,airline,P Aguilar,2024-06-16,"Save yourself the headache and avoid this airline at all costs unless you're okay with arriving a day or two late. The tickets may seem cheaper, but you'll pay in frustration, delays, and a possible detour into madness. I'm not usually one to leave reviews, but my experience with TAAG Angola Airlines was so disastrous that I felt compelled to warn others. My family and I were travelling from South Africa to Lisbon via Luanda, and what should have been a straightforward journey turned into a nightmare. The ""Technical"": We sat at the gate with no sign of the plane. Right at the time we were supposed to board, staff arrived to announce there was ""A Technical."" Yes, just ""A Technical."" Passengers asked, ""A technical what?"" but the answer remained the same. It was like speaking to a malfunctioning robot; it felt as if this gentleman was experiencing a ""Technical"" himself. Instead of providing flight information, they handed out meal vouchers, completely disregarding our concerns and questions about the delay. Waiting and More Waiting: After three hours, the staff reappeared—not to update us but to order food for themselves. When I approached one staff member, he casually informed me that the flight was cancelled due to ""Crew Rest,"" replacing the earlier excuse of a ""Technical."" Without even looking up at me, he remained engrossed in the menu in his hands. The timing seemed suspicious, as I understood the three-hour mark is when airlines are typically required to provide meals for passengers and staff. It felt like the flight was doomed from the start, but they strung us along. Instead of being upfront, cancelling the flight and sending us to a hotel immediately, they made us wait for three hours, ensuring they got their meal compensation before finally sending us to the City Lodge hotel. Finally Flying: We eventually boarded 24 hours late, now with a 5-hour layover in Luanda instead of 3. My seat was stuck in a reclined position, making me explain this to multiple flight attendants as they aggressively instructed me to put my seat up, at takeoff and landing. On top of this, some of our group had broken TVs, adding to the misery. In Conclusion: While TAAG Angola Airlines might offer cheaper tickets, you're likely paying for a high risk of delays, cancellations, and a frustrating experience. When you do eventually fly, it will probably be on an old, rundown plane. However, if you still choose to fly with them, remember if you encounter any issues or deviate from their exact process—including when THEY cancel flights—expect to explain everything multiple times and face an uphill battle with their customer service. I have also since learnt that TAAG has a habit of cancelling half-empty flights at the last minute to reschedule them for the next day, presumably to fill the plane. This experience certainly reinforced that notion. Bottom Line: Spend the extra €100 or €200 for a more reliable airline. Trust me, your sanity is worth it.",Negative,Positive

We suffered 1 delay after the next with absolutely no communication from airline personnel even the boards at the airports did not update with latest information. A trip that was supposed to take me 9 hours took me almost 48 hours. At one point it felt as though I would never get home.

Given that the route we sought to fly was no longer available, we asked for a refund. After several requests and escalating up the chain we were assured in June 2021 that our refund would be processed. We provided all information required for the wire transfer.

TACV Cabo Verde Airlines,airline,M Edwards,2020-01-23,The first leg of the trip saw my son stranded in Cape Verde for over 14 hrs. His plane arrived late and staff left all passengers overnight with no announcements whatsoever. Also there was no entertainment or food served on this trans-Atlantic flight from DC! His return was rescheduled 3 times with a two day differential and the last two reschedules happening on the day of the flight! When he finally arrived at the airport he was told that Cabo Verde had changed his flight to another airline which had already departed. They never sent us notification of this change. We had to end up buying another ticket on another airline. The desk agent even went on to say that his original flight was not even one they had on their normal route schedule. It was a ghost flight.

Cabo Verde customer service was not available or responding. Airport staff disappeared for hours with only police remaining (who would not speak English and spoke only Portuguese which they knew we did not understand) - very unhelpful. We were pretty much stranded for hours in a foreign country with no explanation whatsoever with unfriendly police around. I'll never travel with Cabo Verde or fly through Cape Verde again.

TAG Airlines,airline,S Marshall,2024-05-22,"40+ years of flying, 500+ flights with 80+ airlines in 75 countries, but this was the worst airline I've ever flown with. We booked a nonstop flight from Flores to Cancun in September for a Saturday morning in November. About a week before the departure, they cancelled the direct flight and rerouted us through Guatemala City with a 6 hour layover. When checking in at Flores airport that morning, our bags were checked through to Cancun, but at the airport in Guatemala City the onward flight to Cancun was nowhere to be seen on the departure board. I contacted a TAG agent standing in front of a TAG departute gate for a flight to Belize City that was heavily delayed. This very young man told me the flight to Cancun was cancelled and I could fly the next day at 6pm. I overheard his conversation in Spanish with his colleague who informed him that only 5 people had been booked on that particular flight so they cancelled it. The agent led us to the baggage carrousel where we could retrieve our bags and accompanied us to the check in counter so that we could speak to his supervisor. This young lady was not particularly interested in our situation and repeatedly stated that they could give us a hotel room and we could fly to Cancun the next evening, which would have meant two days wasted at the airport while our hotel in Mexico had already been paid for. Luckily I saw that there was a flight to Merida that had been scheduled for 11am to leave at 7pm. We told them to book us on that flight which they happily did in order to ged rid of us. Since I was eager to get out of that hellhole of an airport as well we flew to Merida and arrived there at around 9pm. That gave us sufficient time to catch a night bus to Cancun. We arrived at our hotel at 7am after spending an awful lot of money for a convenient flight that never happened plus the fare for the bus. Needless to say they never reimbursed us for the night missed night in our hotel.

The staff attitude was rude and unprofessional. It felt like a scam, especially with their baggage policy - charging $3 per extra pound is exorbitant, considering their bags already weigh close to 20 pounds empty. This can add up to more than the cost of the flight itself, which is outrageous for travelers. I strongly advise against flying with TAG Airline. There are far better options available with more reasonable policies and better customer service. Do yourself a favor and choose a different airline.

We just took the flight full of people, because some disembarked in Dresden and new passengers came in the plane. We spent around 6 hours on the plane. Nobody even gave us a bottle of water. We were able to buy food and liquids but they accepted only cash. Can you imagine long trip with small child without water and food? This was really the worst experience ever.

While we were flying over Brazil the pilot suddenly announced that we will be landing in Brasilia because the crew had reached the maximum time that they were allowed to work. We had to get off the plane, go through passport control, pick up our suitcases and go and stand in line to do the check in again. We were in line for more than one hour because many people in front of us had to rebook connecting flights. Four hours later we left Brasilia for Sao Paulo. We spent all that time at the airport and the ground crew did not offer any refreshments. The plane from Brasilia to Sao Paulo was half empty, however, the flight attendant did not allow us to change seats so that we would have more leg room. The flight from Brasilia to Sao Paulo was just over one hour long and we arrived more than 7 hours later than originally scheduled. It is amazing that the crew could not work for just one more hour and instead about 300 people had to be inconvenienced and many missed their connection. When I called the TAM customer service center I spoke to a man who gave me the most ludicrous reasons as to why the crew could not work for one more hour. I had flown this route many times before with Delta or American Airlines and there were some delays but never this type of situation. TAM didn't even offer to compensate us for the delay.

The response we got from the person in the counter was “well is only 150 dollars more you are American you have the money” what type of reaponse is that. She just laughed at us and said that there was nothing she could do, she even said that when she goes to the US she pays more for a ticket, which is even more annoying since it has nothing to do with our issue. So at the end our options were or to pay or to miss our flight. When I asked for a customer service number she said is sunday no one works anyway.

My Wife and I were going to go from Florida to Quito on another airline, and we booked our flights with Tame from Quito to Manta and back to Quito. We had something happen in our personal lives and had to cancel our trip. The biggest issue we had was with Tame. The tickets are 100% non-refundable, and you can't get any credit. We are having an emergency right now and we're just looking to reschedule our trip another time when we can sit and think about planning the dates. Since we can't get a credit, we're forced to pay a fee ($30+ per person) and also immediately choose other dates NOW, which as I said, is not convenient for us at the moment. The only other option is to just lose all the money we paid. They told us we can choose the new dates up to one year after our original flight dates. We settled on dates in June 2020 and called back to reschedule. Then they told us we only have until the date of PURCHASE (May 15th), not the date of our original flight. So we had to hang up and rethink all the dates again. We called back again, then they said ""the system"" won't let us fly that week, we have to fly before May 5th. We don't want to fly at that time, so we call again later after we picked new dates for the third time, in Nov 2019. We call back to reschedule to Nov and now they say we have to pay an additional $110+ in addition to the $250 that we already paid for the first flight. We are looking online and the ticket prices are cheaper than what we originally paid, so why are we having to pay extra, on top of the $30+ per person fees? They can't explain it. So we're being forced to pick dates NOW, which we are not really ready to do, to pick dates we don't want, because they just won't allow us to fly next June, and pay $360+ total for these dates. We decided to just lose everything we paid and learn the lesson to never fly with Tame. We're going to pick the dates we wanted in June 2020, and pay full price with Copa or Avianca instead of dealing with Tame anymore.

TAP Portugal,airline,A Mayle,2025-01-16,"This airline has been the worst airline experience I’ve encountered. First, my flight was delayed by two hours, causing me to miss my connecting flight. They rebooked me on a later flight to Barcelona at 5:30 PM. While I wasn’t thrilled, I accepted it since it wasn’t too late. However, they then canceled the 5:30 PM flight and rebooked me on an 8:55 PM flight instead. I was originally supposed to arrive in Barcelona by 5 PM at the latest, but now I won’t get there until nearly midnight. When I called their customer service to request being placed back on the 5:30 PM flight, I was met with rudeness.

TAR Aerolineas,airline,B Canio,2021-07-12,"The experience starts with the airline asking us to be at the airport 2 hours before the flight yet they do not open the check in both until 1.5 hrs before the flight. The airline asked me to check some hand luggage as I am boarding and hand me a receipt. Once I land, I wait for my hand luggage and it doesn’t come out so I asked the people unloading where it was to which they respond to talk to the air line company. We go to their booth and there is no one there so we call and they do not pick up. After searching the airport and talking to people for 3 hrs. I find out the airline company only opens the booth when they have flights so if your flight lands and they do not have flights, you cannot reach them. They also do not pick up the phone unless you call in “certain hours”. The next day I manage to reach them on the phone and after wasting 2 hrs of my time, they say, there is nothing they can do since they are only a call center to book flights, even though that’s the only number on their website. The only thing they say is that I had to report my lost luggage in person at the airport but after spending another 3 hrs that morning looking and waiting for their booth or ticket counter to open, they did not. After failing to reach their “booth” to report my lost luggage, I had to take my next flight. After landing I call them again and they refused to connect me to their airport department. . We also tried to send emails to them and the only response we got was to call or go to the airport in person. The next day we have some local family go to the airport and try to make a report and even after talking to us on the phone, they refused to accept the report saying we had to appear in person even though we had already left. They also claimed we had messed up by not reporting this so the bag was too far lost but they weren’t even available or answering calls! Worst flight company ever. I would not recommend it It seems to me that asking us to check in a hand bag last minute was on a half empty flight was a scam to steal it, so be careful if you choose to fly with them. Plenty of other companies are available for the same price.",Negative,Positive
TAR Aerolineas,airline,C Parker,2020-01-16,Huatulco to Oaxaca. Booked our flights 6 months in advance and a month later they cancelled our flight. We had booked a return trip and one leg was cancelled but they insisted on cancelling both legs and that I buy a new ticket on the one leg that we could use. The company promised a refund for the cancelled flights plus a 25% bonus as it was the airline that had cancelled the booking for “operational reasons”. They would not reverse the charge on the credit card and insisted that we supply banking information for the refund. We provided all of the information and after several phone calls we still are waiting for the refund 6 months later and no signs of it coming. It appears to me they are running some kind of a scam as I have read a number of reviews with the same complaint. I would suggest if you do not receive your refund in a short period of time ask your credit card company to reverse the charge as the airline has not provided the service. Timing is critical with the credit card company.,Negative,Positive

I insisted and he asked a colleague. He then accepted my suitcase, yet neglected to give me a claim check for my property. I complained, and he said that their baggage printer, or strap tag stock was not the right kind to peel off the claim check, but said he would write down the number for me. I insisted, he went to a supervisor, and while I waited 20"", his colleague, the only Romanian working there, checked seven suitcases without giving any receipts. I got my claim check, but also got some hostile attitude from him just because I insisted that he perform his work duties properly.

Thai AirAsia,airline,R Marshan,2024-10-31,"I am not used to having an airline putting a weight limit to the carry on. So my mistake for not checking their carry on policy. My carry on was double the weight limit of their limit which is 7KG. And my luggage was already 3kg over the limit of one the bag which is 20kg. So when I asked, if I can purchase another bag or weight section or even asked if I can upgrade my ticket to handle my weight overage, answer was no, you can’t. Only option is pay for the excessive rate at the rate of $23 USD per KG. Yes, per KG. When I told them, I had the option to buy additional 20kg when I was checking in online the night before but I didn’t because I didn’t know about the carry on weight limit. They said that option only last up to 4hrs prior the departure time. Essentially they are betting on extorting you at the airport before you fly. Worst part is, there was no other airline that offer a flight to Phuket from Siem Reap. So, they know you are cornered in and you have no choice but to pay 6x more than what you would have paid to purchase additional 20kg online the night before.  More than half the cabin space was empty in the flight as many were extorted by this airline in my flight.  I for sure will never fly with them again. I will inform my community about them.

Once on board we faced a very old business class 2-2-2 with no direct aisle access for window seats. Storage was very limited and the seats unacceptable tight for 2025.

The flight was ok, it would have been nice if the flight destination screen's had been switched on.

She then told me that she wasn’t able to get a payment from my card. She tried to charge me without telling me! She insisted 3-4 times and was very rude. She took my credit card from my hands and when I was asking her of what she was doing I didn’t get a reply! Really, is this your customer service? She told me the extra charge was 65£ but then charged me 130£ Without telling me and I saw it as soon as I boarded the plane!  Why were we treated like that?

We paid for something called Economy Plus which the cabin manager Leanne obviously resented anyone having. Our food was late and had to be prised from the staff...apparently there was some error on the paperwork and we could not have our meals until it was sorted. On a 4 hour flight we not even offered a cup of coffee, a rude member of staff told us they were too busy after they had taken a 'compulsory break' during the flight! We asked for a cold white wine and were told there are no fridges on the aircraft and the ice had run out - in row 2 and service started from the front. In the end we decided to press attendant button and it took 7 minutes for anyone to appear from behind the curtain where the cabin crew were busy munching their food ... a good job it was not an emergency. When she appeared and we asked for our 1st cup of coffee .. some two and half hours into the flight we were told that the sale of duty frees took priority and IF they had time after we may be able to have a cup of coffee - 2 passengers sarcastically asked what the sachets of milk in their meals were supplied for. There were other passengers saying exactly the same as me, Thomas Cook never again. It just seemed like the staff were sure their jobs were going sometime soon and really couldn't care less.

Tigerair,airline,L Wang,2024-09-06,"I flew from Japan to Taiwan in September 2024, expecting a smooth and straightforward travel experience. Unfortunately, what I encountered with Tiger Airways was far from that. My experience was riddled with unnecessary frustration, lack of customer service, and poor handling of what should have been a routine situation. The issue began with my carry-on luggage, which I have taken on numerous flights across various airlines, including EVA Air and several European carriers, without any problem. However, Tiger Airways deemed my bag too large, despite it meeting the standard carry-on size on every other airline I've flown with. They insisted I check it in and charged me an outrageous fee of $47.50 for doing so. This was not a mere inconvenience—it was an unnecessary and excessive charge for something that should have easily been allowed in the cabin, as it has been on countless other flights. What made the situation even more frustrating was the timing. I had planned to spend my last few moments at the gate saying goodbye to a close friend, but instead, I found myself dealing with this avoidable situation. Rather than showing understanding or empathy, the airline staff insisted on enforcing this rigid policy without any flexibility or consideration for the customer. Their insistence on adhering to this unnecessary fee turned what could have been a quick and simple goodbye into an extremely frustrating experience. As someone who has flown extensively across many airlines—budget and premium—this stands out as one of the more disappointing travel experiences. Tiger Airways' approach to customer service felt transactional at best. There was no effort to explain the policy beyond simply demanding the fee. What should have been a moment of service recovery—an opportunity to show that the airline cares about its passengers—was instead handled with indifference. Moreover, the lack of consistency in their baggage policy is troubling. Why should a carry-on that is accepted without issue on other airlines suddenly become an expensive inconvenience on Tiger Airways? This inconsistency leaves passengers like myself feeling blindsided and penalized for simply following the standards that have been widely accepted across the industry. Tiger Airways has clearly chosen to prioritize revenue from additional fees over passenger experience. Instead of fostering a positive relationship with their travelers, they enforce policies that not only feel excessive but also detract from the overall travel experience. Forcing passengers into situations like this does nothing to build trust or loyalty, and it’s hard to imagine recommending this airline to anyone in the future. In conclusion, if you're considering flying with Tiger Airways, I strongly urge you to reconsider. While budget airlines often come with some trade-offs, the level of service and customer care on Tiger Airways falls far below the expected standard, even for low-cost carriers. The hidden fees and rigid policies make what should be an affordable option an unexpectedly expensive and unpleasant one. There are plenty of other airlines out there that manage to offer affordable flights without sacrificing customer service and basic respect for their passengers—sadly, Tiger Airways is not one of them.",Positive,Negative

Inside the plane was a small distance between the seats. The ticket price was very cheap so I cannot complain. Food service was only water with cookies and there was no entertainment system.,Negative,Positive
Transaero Airlines,airline,Yevheniy Kahanovych,2015-06-01,I was on a short hop from Kiev to Moscow. They called it discount class flight. The price tag was well over what Aeroflot and other legacy carriers asked but I needed to be late night at Domodedovo so bought it. The check in was polite but was informed about recent hand baggage rules change: they demanded to pack my backpack into a hold bag and to proceed to a plane with laptop bag only. When onboard was shocked with the seat pitch. Ryanair looks generous after that overcrowded accommodation. You have literally no room to seat plus passengers can recline leaving you no room even to move. The snack service was pathetic with peace of bread in plastic. Crew were polite but not up to other airlines standards. The plane was old. The toilet was smelly. Deplaning in Moscow was via bus. I used to be their loyalty program active user so accumulated some miles. Trying to used them I was unable to book reward ticket via website. This option leads you to a error message on the payment page. Overall overpriced and substandard. Not recommended.,Positive,Negative
TransAsia Airways,airline,L Goh,2013-03-08,"Singapore (SIN) - Taipei (TPE) in economy class on A330. 3-4-3 seating arrangement. Aircraft brand new and hence no complaints about squeaks dirt or anything. Seat was OK and comparable to other A330 seats. Not small but acceptable for large 6ft like me. Not sure about pitch but I reckon should be 32"" and was definitely smaller than SQ. Handrest was a little too low and I've always disliked the slide and recline seats. Food was not good: either fried rice or fried rice noodles. For my TPE-SIN leg the snacks provided with the food was good. Probably because they were selling larger packs of it on their in-flight shopping? IFE was touchscreen with AVOD but small selection. Service was OK. Considering the price paid this was a bargain for full-service airline.",Negative,Positive
Transavia,airline,R Horton,2025-01-23,"This is by far the worst airline I have ever used. I work throughout Europe so I fly every 2 weeks and Transavia is to avoid by every means necessary. They do not provide a legal invoice. Their computer system is bad and regularly does not work so you are not even able to print a proof of payment and you can not check in before your flight. You have to go to the desk and you have to explain to them their system does not recognise your name. Then they will argue with you that it is never their fault. 4, some flight attendants are friendly, but most don't care at all. The air plane was really worn down. Seats were old, not comfortable and not very clean in general. You can't buy anything with cash. My 2 experiences with Transavia were that bad that I rearranged working hours on the project. I now drive 20 to 30 minutes more by car to get to another airport where I can choose other airliners and I happily pay 50 to 70 euro more on a return flight. I will not recommend them to anyone, not even as a cheap budget line.",Negative,Positive

That is 246 euros for two 9 kilo suitcases that were 5 centimeters too wide. In addition, we were unable to use priority boarding on the outward journey because we had to pay the surcharge at a very busy counter. All in all, a big damper on our holiday fun.

Transavia,airline,Aleksandra Shin,2024-09-17,"The most negative experience of my life! In short: I do not recommend flying with this airline ever. To describe it in more detail: - had to pay 65 euros at the airport because only backpacks were allowed and it was heavily hidden when purchasing the ticket. Approximately 20% of our flight paid for luggage because they were also scammed. The employee on departure was extremely rude, she waved her off and did not answer our questions - flights are consistently delayed for 1-3 hours, our flight there was also delayed - the flight back was first delayed for 3 hours, and then they said that it was rescheduled for the next day after lunch. We were taken to the hotel 3 hours later and it was already 2 am. They told me to arrive at the airport at 8:30 am. We arrived, no one knew anything, we started searching and just found out from the airport workers that our flight was canceled - and we were told to just buy new tickets or get home as we wanted. Our flight was supposed to last 3 hours, so our house was not nearby, across the sea - after that we started calling the airline while we were at the airport with our things and didn’t know what to do and when we could fly home. In support, we encountered the incompetence of Transavia support; at first they asked us what we wanted, if we were to fly, we could do it in 2 days. There are no other options. After that, when we went through check-in, we realized that they could take us to another airport in our country, the Netherlands is small. But they didn't do it, yeah but they didn’t do this and we had to rent an apartment and wait for our flight for 2 more days instead of being at home.",Negative,Positive

I tried to show them on my phone and they just rejected even looking at it. So I told the lady there that I would like a full refund if they are refusing my bags so that I can take another flight. She asked the supervisor and she agreed. Unprofessionally, without word, they ripped off all the luggage tags and threw them onto the floor, then pushed the bags towards us. When I was waiting for my refund, they told me to ""go to the website"". ""That wasn't the deal"" I said, as they told me they would refund me here and now. So I said I'll take the flight then, but they need to accept my bags. I have TEO upgraded tickets and both of these tickets, each one, covers the baggage.

We contacted them to say that we would be arriving the next day to see what flights we could get on and they said we had to pay over $500 to hold the seats or the whole reservation would be cancelled. We were delayed in Houston by United airlines problems and tried to get on a later same day flight instead of calling Tropic Air right away to cancel. Apparently, spending that time trying to get to Belize City later that same day would have been fine if it had worked out, but since it failed and we couldn't get on a new flight until the next day, we missed their 1 hour notification window and would have to pay for our tickets twice.

Tropic Air Belize,airline,W Chen,2023-07-02,"There is not a lot of options besides Tropic air or Maya Island Air for local travel in Belize. I've flown both and I would say that Tropic Air was a disappointment. I booked a flight with family from Belize City to Dangriga and was dropped off at Placencia. Tropic Air said that they could not land in Dangriga due to issues with the airport at that time. Tropic Air could not schedule another flight that day due to no other scheduled flights leaving that day but it was only 1pm so does the airport only run for half a day?? Also, Tropic Air did not offer another flight the following day so my family was basically stranded in Palencia. My family's 15 minute flight from Belize City to Dangriga turned into 4.5 hour ordeal to get to Dangriga (30 minute flight to Placencia, 1 hour at the Placencia airport trying to figure out how to get to Dangriga, 2.5 hour bus ride to Dangriga. We did ask for a refund for that portion of the flight because we paid for a flight to Dangriga but Tropic Air refused as we did fly in their plane regardless of where we intended to go. In the end, we 1) spent more than 4 hour more on transportation, 2) cancelled paid reservations from being late, 3) paid for additional bus fare and 4) were refused a refund from Tropic Air. Tropic Air is not a reputable business as they will take your money without fulfilling their obligation to transport you to your destination. They can literally drop you off anywhere and still take your money because they only care that you got on the plane.",Negative,Positive

If only I had checked the premium box (for 60 euros per person) then it would not have been a problem to change it! I have rarely encountered such rip-offs. I understand that I should pay for a change, but just saying that I should just buy a completely new ticket really goes way too far.

No word of sorry, no one to talk to - we all have been left to our own, basically. Best even: they served food and drinks on the plane and wanted to charge money after this disaster.

My Chicago to Istanbul flight was delayed by over 3 hours, causing me to miss my connection to Malta. Turkish Airlines rebooked me on another flight, but that flight also departed late, meaning I missed my connection again and was forced to wait another 9 hours in Istanbul for the next available flight. The only thing they provided during this 9-hour wait was one free mea l— completely inadequate for such a long delay and Turkish Airlines refused to compensate me. Despite all of these issues being caused by their delays, Turkish Airlines offered me nothing but a 15% discount on a future fligh which is insulting, considering how much time and money I lost. They closed my compensation request without even properly reviewing it, refusing to acknowledge their responsibility.

The aircraft, a Boeing 777, looked fairly new and as I was flying Business Class I had high expectations. The cabin crew were emotionless and stilted when I was shown my seat, and I was offered a plastic cup of water or Pepsi as a pre-flight drink. I asked if there was any Champagne but was told ""No -a lcohol is not allowed"" There were only 6 pax in Business Class, but Economy was full. Crew were very lax completing pre take off safety checks, and we took off with 2 passengers with their seats in lay flat bed mode. The minute the wheels left the tarmac the crew released their seat belts and started walking around the galley and cabin. There are large seat back TV screens, but there is no entertainment onboard. Food is served piping hot, but is so bad that it is inedible. Around an hour into the 6 hour flight a male FA plonked himself down in the empty seat across the aisle from me, reclined the seat and then watched a movie on his smart phone. When the seatbelt sign came on for landing at Birmingham the crew went through the motions of pre-landing safety checks, but did not ensure that seats were upright or that window blinds were open.

Ukraine International,airline,G Manlazi,2021-07-01,"My flights got cancelled and rescheduled three times. When I finally flew, I wasn't expect anything. I just wanted to get home quickly, but that didn't work out. First they had to reissue a new boarding pass, because the one I'd printed out wasn't working in the new Berlin airport. Everybody had that problem, so we had to stand in line and wait 1 hour, just to get the new boarding passes. In Berlin the Immigration Control was overcrowded and nobody from the airline cared about asking the Federal Police to opening up more Immigration desks, in order to be able to handle all of these people. Then, after running to the gate and boarding, we had to wait 45 minutes for everybody else to slowly arrive. But we still made it to Kiev on time. When boarding in Kiev, the whole boarding process took 1 hour. The crew was visibly overwhelmed by the crowd, but we still made it to Yerevan kind of on time. On my way back, the boarding in Yerevan was more coordinated. When I arrived in Kiev, I had to find out, that my flight has been rescheduled once again, resulting in me missing my classes in Berlin. The Babooshka at the Information point didn't feel like answering and there was no flyUIA representative in the transit zone. Once boarding started around 2 hours after the original time, I asked the representative why our flight was delayed and why we weren't notified, she just said that there was an operational delay and that they were sorry. Nothing else. No kind of reimbursement was offered, not even a proper apology. I guess I learned my lesson: no matter how cheap flyUIA is, I won't be flying with them anymore, since you don't get anything in return, no matter how low your expectations are. Even the most basic thing, such as bringing you to your destination on time, are not met by this Airline. Cabin crew was just friendly enough, but nothing compared to other low-cost or traditional airlines. The seats were narrower than on other low-cost-airlines and not comparable to ""normal"" airlines.

I purchased the upgrade with cash instead. I called when I landed and the agent assured me it would take 7 to 10 business days to process the refund but to send an email to customer service with information he provided and to call back in 48 hours to ask them to expedite it. I emailed in the information and patiently waited the 7 to 10 business days. At 10 days I had not received the refund so I called the airline and was told they had no idea and had no record about the refund request. They said they'd refer it to their refund department and I'd receive a call the next day. I did not receive a call. I called back the next business day and explained the entire situation to customer service again since there was no record of the call. They told me that it was not refundable. I protested. They escalated the call and put me on hold. 36 minutes into the call another agent answered the call who had no idea what was happening and so I explained it all over again.

Once when I was flying from Samara (Russia) to St. Petersburg (Russia) we were on the bus with the doors open at -20 °, everyone was waiting for the late passenger when he approached it turned out that he had problems with the size of hand luggage, and we continued to stand and freeze.

Boarding process was utter chaos. Zero communication. No one spoke English, which caused problems for some Chinese passengers who didn't understand the luggage weight limits and held everyone else up as a result.

US Airways,airline,L Wilson,2015-10-15,"The US Airways flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia were fine and so was my domestic flight to Memphis. However, my return flight via Charlotte to London Heathrow, was a complete nightmare. We taxied to the run way on time to me told by the captain that a fault (which he said they knew about and should have already been fixed earlier that day) had occurred, it was nothing serious and we would go back to the stand for the system to be rebooted, then we would be on our way. Well, the reboot took place, pushed back from the stand to be told the fuel switch over light had come back on and we would have to return to the stand for engineers to take another look as reboot hadn't worked. Sat on stand for ages, then the captain said anyone who wished to leave the plane, to rearrange connecting flights, or to stretch their legs was welcome to do so and return to the plane at anytime. I was travelling with my disabled mother, but was worried as my father was due to travel 2hrs to collect us at Heathrow, and due to the time difference was about to leave her home in the UK. I asked a stewardess if it would be OK to leave my mom on the plane while I just step outside to make a call. Her words were ""no problem"". I left the plane and was told I had to go past the barriers at the departure gate, which I duly did. I managed to contact my father and asked the ground crew if I could return to the plane. The man was so rude and said no way, can't get back on the plane unless we tell you. I tried to explain that wasn't how it was told to us and I had my disabled mother onboard the aircraft, he shrugged his shoulder and walked away. I then noticed a woman staff member, who was talking to another couple, I waited at a distance, no saying a word as I didn't want to interrupt their conversation, but the women staff member turned to me and said, ""don't interrupt, I'll deal with you in a minute"". I was totally stunned at her attitude. Well, eventually I did get back on the plane but only after explaining about my mother and what the captain and stewardess had said. Eventually everyone was allowed back on board as we were told the plane had been fixed. Again we pushed back to be told fault had reappeared and engineers were going to replace a value. Again we were told it was fixed, pushed back, and, you guessed it, fault reappeared. This time we were told by the captain, even if the plane could be fixed a new crew would have to be found as they were now illegal to fly. This took place over 6hrs! One half filled cup of water and a packet of pretzels were given within those 6hrs. Then came the announcement, the flight was cancelled. Everyone got off, but my mother needed a wheelchair which took ages to come so by the time we got out to the departure gate we were last in the queue. Eventually given a flight home, 24hrs later, told couldn't get us a hotel as NASCAR was in town, given a cot to sleep on and $20 in food vouchers, but this was after midnight and no food outlets were open. When it was bought to the staff attention, the lukewarm food from the plane was given to us. My mother couldn't sleep in the cot provided so spent a sleepless night in her wheelchair. This episode was a complete nightmare, most of the staff were just plain rude, with two exceptions of the ground crew at the departure gate.",Negative,Positive
US Airways,airline,David Newberger,2015-10-14,"I was traveling with my girlfriend to Vegas and then onto San Diego for a short 5 day vacation. When I booked my flights I had the option of selecting my seat assignments. We chose to sit in the emergency exit rows or as close to the front as possible. After I chose the seats, the airline confirmed they were our seats. When we left out of Akron Canton airport we were in the last row of the airplane. No big deal. It was a 1.25 hour flight to our connection. The next flight they didn't even have us sitting next to each other. She was two rows behind me on the opposite side of a full plane, with both of us having middle seats. Nobody trades you seats for a middle seat. We had three planes to board out of San Diego on our way home. Not one time were the seats next to each other. Why offer me a opportunity to reserve my seats and then not give them to me. Was it because someone paid the extra fee to take my seats? Probably. I sent US Airways an email to ask them why this happened. Their response was sorry, I hope you choose to fly with us in the future. The flight attendants are rude. The customer service is horrible. There is no chance I will fly with them again.

I am an 18 year old college student, and I was hours away from home and an hour from school. The representative I spoke with was rude and unwilling to help me.

The solution of this was to just tell us we were not going to be flying and we would need to make alternative way home. We were not offered any transfer to another flight, a hotel to fly the following day, not even a glass of water. This left us stranded in Kuala Lumpur and had to book another flight that cost us almost $2500.

I nearly missed my flight because of the staff dragging their feet and refusing to fix the problem.

Due to the limited counters, there are set check in times for different flights. Since our flight was at 10.25 am departure, we are strictly only allowed to check in at 8.55.

We fly business class a lot with other airlines but this is our first experience with Virgin Atlantic. While the service by crew was on par, the layout and space was awful. First, there is less storage room overhead than any international flight I have been on, let alone in business class. There is no room for any personal item such as laptop bag storage - even in coach there is underwear storage space. The lay flat beds fold over which feels like a waste of space and requires passengers to get up and adjust. All the seats face each other across the aisle, which is weird for privacy.

Virgin Atlantic,airline,Michael Gier,2024-07-30,"There were many problems with our round trip flight from Los Angeles to London, but let me start by saying that the flight attendants are outstanding, so this review is not a reflection on them. Both planes in the round trip were old planes with old fashion business class seats, Virgin calls them Upper Class seats, and they were small and cramped. And the food on both flight was awful. We were very disappointed with what they served and how it tasted after paying so much for Upper Class. On the return flight to Los Angeles we were supposed to have a newer plane with much nicer lay flat seats but Virgin changed the plane to one of the old planes, and worse yet, 7 of the seats in Upper Class had major issues; we had one of those seats. When we checked in they warned us that our seat would not lay flat by pushing a button, but that the flight attendants would be able to do it manually. They asked if that was ok, and we said as long as we can lay flight then yes. When we got on the plane, the flight attendants said no, we can't manually lay the seats flat. So the check-n staff lied to us, and every person that had bad seats were told the same thing, ""it'll be fixed before the plane takes off,"" or ""they'll be able to lay the seat flat manually."" Those lies made things frustrating for the flight attendants because they had to deal with the fallout when passengers were told otherwise. Most of the 7 seats didn't lay flat and were stuck in the upright position, and some didn't have the entertainment system working and so those people couldn't watch movies or anything on this 11 hour flight because the entire electrical system was out in those seats. Why are they using a continuing to use a plane that has so many seat issues?! And we don't know how many seats in the rest of the plane had problems. Upper Class was very expensive and we paid it for many reasons but mainly for the lay down seats, and yet Virgin thinks it's ok to use this plane over and over again with so many seats not working?! And even worse, the plane was going to continue being used and so more unsuspecting passengers that paid a lot of money are going to have the same issue. I don't know how Virgin is getting away with this and treating their paying customers so poorly. It's unacceptable, and we'll never fly with them again.",Negative,Positive

Saw some other passengers on the flight who told us to go to the Virgin desk as they were booking people into hotels. So, went back there and they gave us a booking confirmation for a room at a hotel close to the airport. We get a taxi there, and go reception, to find most of the passengers from our flight crowded into reception. Guy at reception seems to have no idea what to do, and there's no clear communication, but it seems that it will be pot luck as to who gets a room. Nowhere else to go, so we wait for hours at reception, until at 3am, we're told we're not going to get a room. So, many of us end up trying to sleep in the reception area, without even access to a toilet. Contact Virgin and they blame hotel. Hotel blames Virgin. Virgin refuse any compensation because we were not 'out of pocket'. Despite the fact that, because we didn't get any room for the night, Virgin did not have to pay the cost of a room.",Negative,Positive
Vistara,airline,20 reviewsS Hunsel,2024-06-12,"A late night flight (10 pm) delayed by almost 45 minutes is not the most pleasant beginning to the journey, especially given the horrible Encalm Lounge in Delhi (dirty, crowded, rubbish food). However, the onboard experience was amazing, the A321 has lie-flat seats with large IFE screens (which is a treat, since I could sleep comfortably for over an hour in a less than 2 hour flight). The cabin crew were prompt, helpful and very attentive. Upto 4 food choices and a pretty good spread. The IFE screens were great and the entertainment catalog is good enough for a short domestic flight but would be a bit boring for a 4-5 hour or above flight. However, baggage claim experience was not the best, despite the baggage being priority tagged it arrived after 60-65% of the co-passengers in the flight had received their bags, and when you are running over an hour late, it was a bit frustrating.",Negative,Positive
Viva Air,airline,C Lewis,2022-09-06,"Horrible experience, they gave my husband, my 13 yr old daughter and I separate seats, they had no option to confirm or buy seats online, only at the airport and after we checked bags and enter checkpoint noticed they had given us separate seats. I spoke to a flight attendant and they insisted we had to pay extra for seats like if that option was even available to start with, I asked to be seated just with my daughter and they say no, after we landed I saw the plane had 12 consecutive seats empty all the flight and they were not even courteous enough to offer from the beginning before even taking off from the airport. On my connecting flight I notice almost the entire plane was on the same situation, you guys don’t realize that you would have gotten more money even on the catering service and people would buy food and drinks if you were to seat them together, I did not have a very pleasant experience in the country and this was just like the cherry on the ice cream.

Then we landed in Mexicali, and were kept in the plane for over 2 hours with no information. Then they told us we could either get off in Mexicali or fly back to Mexico City. They lied about the situation, it seems they had an issue with their landing permits. All just horrible. Don’t ever fly with them.",Negative,Positive

They rescheduled his for an early morning flight today, but when he arrived at Havana airport three hours before the flight, they simply did not check my son in. Despite having a ticket and an assigned seat, VivaAerobus staff kicked a minor off the flight and said that all the seats were already taken! They offered him a later flight with an overnight layover of more than 10 hours in Mexico City! Can you even imagine how a minor is supposed to handle such a flight alone? Este ha sido el peor experiencia con la aerolínea VivaAerobus. Mi hijo debía volar de La Habana a Cancún y su vuelo fue cancelado debido al huracán Helena.

A pesar de que tenía boleto y asiento confirmado, ¡los empleados de VivaAerobus sacaron a un menor de edad del vuelo y dijeron que ya todos los asientos estaban ocupados!

VivaAerobús,airline,Nader Elkhweet,2024-08-29,"Terrible experience with this Airline - regarding flight Cancún to Monterrey 11am flight on 28 August 2024: I paid extra for extra luggage and despite they did not follow their own rules and they were very rude in the process I tried to check-in a finishing net that I bought for my son, but at the check in counter they refused as it was not in a plastic container or box or luggage So I tried to bring it on the cabin where it can fit perfectly well. I was able to pass easily security as this is just a fishing net and does not represent any security risk, in fact security take away my 2 bottles of water but allow this. But at the boarding gate the same person that refused to check it in also refused to board unless I leave behind the net. The reason for denying us the boarding with the fishing net was claimed to be that the object in his opinion could look like a weapon and the airline has the right block it. I asked for the supervisor to and VivaAerobus Station manager to whom I asked to show me such a policy and he was not able to show it to me. But he still insisted that the fishing net can not be brought on-board and also that they could not provide any form or document showing that the object was confiscated by VivaAerobus Cancún Station. They waited until the very end of the boarding and then bullying us that if we did not leave the net behind the would deny us the boarding. Interesting fact is that we brought this same net all the way from Italy on the cabin of multiple airplanes: Milan-Atlanta with Delta, Atlanta-Mexico with Delta, Mexico to Cancún with Aeromexico. But today to go to Monterrey VivaAerobus applied different rules based on the opinion of their ground staff putting themself above the security of the Cancún Airport that allow us to bring it onboard. Below the photos of the fishing net that was stopped at the gate. I will also put a formal complain to VivaAerobus and see what they have to explain this incident.",Negative,Positive
VivaAerobús,airline,Jefferson Steelflex,2024-06-03,"I am beyond amazed at the ineptitude of this airline. These guys are the absolute epitome of ""I do not care, not my problem"". I missed a flight because of a delay on the airline's end and to further exacerbate this, they took my bags before I boarded the plane because there was no longer room on board the plane. I explained to them I had a flight to catch upon arriving in Cancun and they assured me that I would receive my bags in time for me to catch my flight. Well that was a lie. Upon arriving in Cancun, they took an absolute eternity with getting me my bags. I had to abandon them and hope they would send them to Toronto because I did not want to miss my flight. Well I ended up missing my flight and when I explained the situation to the personnel they had at the check in counter. They only gave me a phone number to call. After calling said phone number, they told me they would not reimburse me or give me any kind of compensation, not even a place to stay for the night because I had nowhere to go. I was beyond frustrated. All they offered was a 25% off voucher for my next flight with them (bold of them to assume I would even want to fly with this POS airline once more). I accepted and gave my email and they said they would send me the voucher in the coming days. I have yet to receive it. I called customer service and they told me they will not send me anything until I provide a confirmation number. I told them I have no such thing and they told me to go to the website where I booked my flight and retrieve it from them. After retrieving this, they tell me that they will not help me at all. I do not understand the way this airline operates at all. It is amazing how bad the customer service for this airline is.  They simply do not care. It is ridiculous.",Negative,Positive

I called customer service and they refused to refund my original payment for the bag. Additionally, it took an extra 30 minutes for me to get my bag and I was in a rush once we arrived because the flight was delayed over an hour. For anything oversize, they will make you wait till every bag is off the carousel and then they go somewhere where you can’t go to retrieve your bag which takes so long. It made me late to my appointment and I will never fly with them again. I did not appreciate the customer service person was talking to me, in my opinion they are scam artist they are scam artists.

Spent 2 hours on the phone to change a reservation then at the end the lady said it was not possible. When I logged in to select baggage purchase what I didn't realize is they automatically select all the extra services so when I clicked on the baggage I was actually un-clicking it. The result was I paid 150K pesos for a bunch of charges and then when I arrived at the gate they told me I had not selected baggage and they charged me 200K pesos for 2 bags at the gate.

They claim the problem is that I previously used a different Vueling Club account number linked to an email address I no longer use. They said I could resolve this by creating new account and then they would merge them. Even though they claim this happened - my flights no longer correctly show on the new account. After countless of contact back and forth with the customer service team about this I received a standard reply to my queries, putting the blame on me for not stating my loyalty number or email correctly at the time of booking. Not only did I always list my club account number when booking - I followed all their instructions to change and merge my loyalty accounts. Still they only reply in relation to my Avios and not the number of flights and reaching Premium status. Since this message I’ve contacted them thrice as well as emailed the CEO - without any reply. This company does not even care about their frequent flyers that fly more than 50 times per year with them… avoid at all cost!",Negative,Positive
Vueling Airlines,airline,M Ranez,2024-12-14,"I was denied boarding on my flight from Naples to Barcelona because my electric wheelchair, which contains two 180Wh batteries, was deemed non-compliant with airline regulations. This was despite my batteries being well within the 300Wh limitset by IATA for lithium-ion batteries in mobility aids. Vueling’s own policy** (published on their website) stating that non-removable, securely attached batteries have no maximum Watt-hour limit.  Properly declaring my wheelchair and batteries during booking and again at check-in. Even with these facts, I was told I could only board if I left my batteries behind. This would have rendered my wheelchair useless and left me without any mobility. As a result, I had to stay behind, incurring significant unexpected costs for hotel accommodations, meals, and alternate travel arrangements. Lufthansa approved my wheelchair for transport without issue just a few hours later.  Vueling’s actions demonstrated a lack of training, poor customer service, and disregard for accessibility rights.

Vueling Airlines,airline,James Scott,2024-11-08,"Second last Vueling flight out of Gatwick on Sunday evening. Lots of problems that evening with weather in BCN and especially to the south of that airport so plane in was delayed. Early indications were for a 70 minute delay but the crew were anxious to make up for lost time and expedited boarding. Unfortunately the Captain then informed us that BCN was limiting arrivals and that we would need to wait for 20-30 minutes before pushing back, so losing the advantage that the efficiency of crew had apparently won for us. Flight left as outlined per previous comments. Flight was exceedingly smooth; which counts for an awful lot with this passenger. (Perhaps because we flew straight across Paris rather than down the Atlantic coast; but the tannoy was so poor that I couldn't make out the comments 'not' heard. Unfortunate! But unimportant vs arriving safely; and that after a very smooth flight.) Very minor hiccups on arrival, exactly 60 mins after fairly generous scheduled time. Which left the Captain more than a little frustrated as he and his crew had been super-efficient. Overall, it's not the QE2 or the Hilton for sure, but in my experience Vueling is always (?) the best price on this route which we use 2 or 3 times per year and, based on that degree of exposure to this company, I contend that their service is by not as poor as a number of recent posts here suggest.",Positive,Negative

We were 2 people travelling on separate bookings and during our connection our 2 bags got lost and were delayed for 48 hours ruining the first 2 days of our holiday. The person at the airport only created 1 PIR incident and included the 2 lost suitcases in it. We obviously opened 2 claims with 2 different claim numbers as this was 2 people on 2 different bookings. They have paid 1 of the claims and now have closed the PIR incident without paying the 2nd claim. I called last week and spoke to an agent who said that a supervisor would call me. A week later no one had called me so I asked for a supervisor to call me back. This time, a supervisor called me back saying that the PIR was closed and he understood that it wasn't fair that only 1 claim had been settled but that it was legal and I would be getting nothing and to ask the other person to share half of his compensation.

Wamos Air,airline,B Raeburn,2019-08-02,"Gatwick to Chicago. I have flown this airline twice now and these were the worst flights I have been on. I booked through Norwegian and the flights were operated by Wamos. I'll never make the mistake of ignoring that again. To begin with, the seats are massively uncomfortable. I wasn't expecting luxury, but I could actually feel how the plastic fit together through the seat cover on this flight. Additionally, the cost of food was $45, so I chose not to order food, opting instead to bring snacks on the plane. Both flights I took were transatlantic, so around 8-9 hours. If you had not paid for food, they would not allow you to have even water. actually saw the flight attendants laugh in other passengers' faces when they asked for a cup of water on an 8+ hour flight! One of these flights didn't even allow passengers a chance to purchase snacks or drinks, either. The gate agents weighed passengers carry-on baggage when they felt like it (in other words, arbitrarily), so some people with overweight luggage were allowed on regardless of weight, while others had to pay £80 to check their luggage at the gate. My flight from London to Chicago took off over 2 and a half hours late and nearly caused me to miss my next flight. The crew were in no rush to help passengers move quickly off the plane, even knowing that there were people with layovers who would now need to make connecting flights with drastically less time (including going through customs, awaiting baggage, transferring to domestic terminals, and going through security again.) I would rather pay a massive last-minute ticket price than ever ride with this airline again and if I ever find myself in a position to fly with them again, I would either spend the money for a different airline, or just stay home.",Positive,Negative
Wamos Air,airline,Lynn Doble,2019-01-03,"Denver to Gatwick. Wamos Air was used by Norwegian Air during my trip home to the UK in December. They contacted me by e mail informing me of this change. I was rather annoyed as I had flown Norwegian in the Summer as was very pleased with the service. I called Norwegian whose agent assured me it would be exactly the same service including my seat reservation and ordered vegetarian meal. The flight out from Denver was ok, despite my vegetarian meal being some inedible dried up pasta dish. Breakfast was a barely thawed hard bread mozzarella sandwich. There were no TV'S in the seats and one had to log on onto Wamos Air which I was not prepared to do as I only had Cellphone and did not want to use my batteries. In the return journey to Denver the flight was delayed by half an hour. In both directions I was placed in a middle seat not an aisle seat as booked. One lady was kind enough to swap with me. Fortunately on the way back the aisle seat next to me was vacant. By moving one seat over and informing the flight attendants I had done this, must have caused great confusion for them. I did not receive my vegetarian meal at all. I asked three times to various attendants which proved quite annoying to them regarding their passive aggressive facial expressions. Finally they told me they had run out of vegetarian hot lunches and brought me a cheese sandwich and a free beer, probably to appease me. I was not at all complaining at the time but their general attitude towards me was aloof and unfriendly. I went to the galley to ask for a cup of tea x interrupting three attendants happily chatting away in Spanish. I wondered why they could not have such cheery dispositions towards the passengers. One girl very much put out it appeared, gave me a cup of tea. The annoyance on her face was very apparent. I am shocked that a reputable good airline such as Norwegian would contract such a sub standard company to replace them. I paid my money and it was not that cheap for a service that made my journey uncomfortable and unfriendly. I have read other negative reviews of Wamos Air, so I am joining the throng of a large number number of very dissatisfied customers. Would not recommend Wamos to anyone.

WestJet Airlines,airline,Kelly Grace,2025-01-16,"Extremely disappointed in this airline. A decline in customer service has been noticeable over the years however this latest experience takes the cake. We boarded in Honolulu at midnight Dec 19 (already 2 hours delayed). We sat on the plane for 3 hours before takeoff. The waitress said maintenance was working to fix the bathroom and had to go back and forth for tools. Believe it or not, the bathroom was still out of commission when we took off at 3am. Of course, we missed our connecting flight as a result. In Vancouver I asked WestJet staff what we could do to get home. After getting passed to someone else for the third time I was told my family (I'm with my wife and 2 children) were bumped to fly home Dec 21st at 10pm. Meanwhile, the other passengers on the plane were getting boarded to Kelowna at 2pm that very day. I know this because my in-laws who we were traveling with were bumped to that flight. I explained that I had to work and couldn't stay in Vancouver for 2 days but the young lady at the counter didn't seem to care and gave us a hotel voucher and didn't even try. I was flustered and stressed and there was nothing I could say to get her to try to help us get home. As I walked away she was chuckling with her friend. What a joke. I called customer support from the hotel and after about an hour on the phone we were given seats on that evening's flight at 10pm. That flight also delayed until 12:30am but at least we got home. I missed out on several hundred dollars because I missed work, I had to Uber home ($100) from the airport because my in-laws were our ride and they left on an earlier flight, and I was out of pocket for several meals. I took the time to submit expenses (with receipts) to WestJet and also file a passenger rights claim. They replied a week or so later telling me there's nothing they are willing to do as it was an unscheduled maintenance situation. No, I won't fly WestJet again.

I arrived at airport more than 2 hours before, then was told that we had to complete an electronic immigration and health form before being allowed to board (no one flying was aware of this requirement prior to flying). After filing, I had to receive a confirmation from St. Kitts authorities via email. There was no notice of this when booking the flight, nor follow-up via email 24 hours before checking in. In my mind, I thought that I will be IN transit, and would only need to do the regular paper filings and show my vaccination card and recent test results, if necessary. Anyway, on completing the tiresome form, which was laborious, had questions with no relevance, and hard to navigate, I waited half an hour with no response from St. Kitts in my inbox. I then went to my spam folder to find an odd query from St. Kitts, telling me to refile. Tried to refile, but couldn't get back into their system, because of course, they were still processing my initial filing.

To cancel the ticket, I had to pay 200 dollars, but as for the return ticket, if there was one, it had happened and if I canceled it, I also had to pay 200 dollars for person means that they were only going to return me about 78 dollars, in short I had no other option but to pay 250 dollars more for people for a ticket that I had just bought and it is not my fault that the agency found it is a lack of respect because It wasn't my fault and then I went to the page and they were still selling the economy class so I imagine that could have happened to many. Anyway I had to pay 1000 dollars more just to change the class 250 for people this is incredible.  Es un robo total hoy saqué 4 pasajes para mi familiares que vuelan habana cuba a Panamá clase económica de ida y go plus de regreso después de haber hecho la confirmación y pagar 1994.81 dólares llame para estar segura de que todo estaba bien y me dijeron que el boleto de ida no estaba confirmado porq estaba sobrevenido y que no quedaban haciéndose en esa clase para cancelar el boleto tenía que pagar 200 dólares pero como para el boleto de regreso si había ese si había pasado y si lo cancelaba también tenía que pagar 200 dólares por persona quiere decir que solo me iban a regresar como 78 dólares en fin no tuve otra opción que pagar 250 dólares más por personas un boleto que lo había acabado de comprar y no tengo la culpa que la agencia lo halla sobrevenido es una falta de respeto porque no fue mi culpa y después entré a la página y seguían vendiendo la clase económica así que me imagino que eso le pudo haber pasado a muchos.en fin tuve que pagar 1000 dólares más solo por cambiar la clase 250 por personas esto está increíble.",Negative,Positive
Wingo,airline,Francisco Cruz,2024-09-26,"My recent experience with this airline was nothing short of appalling. First, when departing from the Dominican Republic, they did not charge me for a carry-on bag, which was the one positive aspect of my trip. However, they made up for it by charging me simply because their system gave me an error code (404) and I couldn't download my e-ticket. Instead of offering a solution, they charged me for the ""privilege"" of printing a boarding pass. On my return from Medellín, the situation worsened. The flight attendants displayed an astonishing lack of professionalism. They attempted to charge me for a carry-on bag, which clearly fit within their sizing guidelines. I had to insist it was indeed a carry-on. Despite this, they claimed another bag was not ""purchased"" as a carry-on, forcing me to pay triple just to bring a clearly valid bag on board. Absolutely absurd. The attitude of a flight attendant was particularly disturbing—rude, condescending, and giving passengers disdainful looks paired with a hostile tone. Her behavior was not only unprofessional but also incredibly disrespectful. The most shocking incident occurred when I was forced to pay yet again for a carry-on, and this time they wouldn’t accept American Express or even U.S. cash. To add insult to injury, the attendant had the audacity to suggest I leave my bag behind and fly without it! The sheer absurdity of this situation is mind-blowing. The way this airline operates is beyond belief. Passengers are being nickel-and-dimed at every opportunity and subjected to poor treatment because people don't stand up for themselves. This airline's practices are unethical and, frankly, disgraceful.",Negative,Positive

Thanks to them I have missed my international flight paid 1500 euros more. Until now no one has admitted their mistake no one has apologised. And no one wants to help.

We tried their chat, not working. We tried to call but endless lines. When we showed up early in the morning ending up in line for check in, it’s possible the clerk did not speak english, but we were sent to another line, there we had to pay 220 zloty pr person, cause we had not checked in online. Then back again, this time we got the boarding cards. We went in among the last ones, no space for the luggage. We heard the attendants tell us passengers just to put trolleys in the overhead bin.

When we started our decent, the captain informed us that Krakow airport was closed, and we had to land in Katowice. Outside Katowice airport we did not find one single representative from Wizzair. A lot of busses were lined up, but no signs on them, we tried to ask people that was on the same plane , and could speak polish, what was hoing on. Nobody knew. The busses was not for us, but Ryanair passengers. So we ended up with a taxi to Krakow, cause we gave up to find a bus. A very bad experience with Wizzair, all about their customer service is bad, started already from online check in and onward.

No responses, No communication, No refund, No emails, No calls, Nothing. We got the luggage the last day in Havana airport and what’s funny about that is that we still don’t have any response from World2Fly customer service. If you read answers from them when you read reviews online then you will see how they respond and always ask you to stay in touch with their customer service but in the end you will don’t get any answer back.

WOW air,airline,Jennifer Liss,2019-03-06,"We had booked the Wowair stopover Detroit to Barcelona via Keflavik and just shy of 2 weeks prior to our vacation (family of 5), we received a text and email from Wowair saying they had cancelled our BCN stopover. Because we had already scheduled time off work and school and hotels, cars, meeting others in Barcelona, we were forced to buy connections on Air France. WOW said they could get us as Paris so we had to purchase 5 round air tickets from CDG to BCN, lost 2 days of our vacation, lost a night in a hotel in BCN, had to pay for a hotel at CDG, spent almost 2 full days dealing with connections, layovers (extra costs for food, car etc) Then several days before our DTW to KEF flight, WOW air changed our airplane and scattered us all over the airplane (kids in middle seats in back etc). We were one of the first to book on the flight (Was empty at time) and had paid to purchase upgraded seats together/seats together. Wow did not honor seat assignments. spent close to 2 days on phone / email / twitter support with Wowair and AirFrance and hotels/car rental scheduling, rescheduling, getting seat assignments, seeking compensation. Wow cites an EU regulation that if cancel 2 weeks before, will offer no compensation; they slipped in just before 2 week window with cancelled flights. The staff was very nice but the company is just horrible. We were out approximately $2000 all in and no compensation or accommodation from company. Very sad because this was a long planned family trip that we had saved for and planned for a long time. The day we were flying, the company was offering ""free flights to people with the last name Valentine"". Very gimmicky and not taking care of their paying customers. Lastly, truly the most uncomfortable flight we have ever been on. It is a discount airline but so this is to be expected (though not at all discount when they screw you and cancel your flight). The economy / no upgrade seats are the most uncomfortable you could imagine, people were very miserable. Many families, could not move around at all. The first three rows were very large, like the people could do a pike/legs straight out. Makes no sense to give the upgraded seats too much room while the other 30 rows really suffered. The flights were packed and a lot of unhappy people. They charge for even water so the by the time you pay for water, food, definitely consider an upgrade, charges for luggage and if you are really unlucky - cancellation fees - you could fly first class with a reputable airline. Iceland is lovely but fly Delta or United or partners or anyone but Wowair. I read many many complaints on the internet etc. that they did this same behavior to many many other people. Company really does not deserve your hard earned vacation dollars. I would urge you to fly a more reliable airline.",Negative,Positive
XL Airways France,airline,Maria Barrow,2019-08-11,"My family and I traveled this summer from Austin to Miami, two cities in Colombia, Madrid, France, and New York. We used multiple airlines and took carry-on bags on all of them. We are a family of four, and each of us took a carry-on suitcase. The bags qualified for carrying on in all of the airlines that we used, except for this one. Ridiculous enough, the trip that we used XL airways was an international trip from Paris to New York. At the airport, XL airways had a small compartment to measure the bags that they said the bag needed to fit in, including the wheels. It seems like they were doing this scam often enough because when we were boarding there were three guys ready to take ""the bags that people couldn't take as carry-ons"" in the plane. The representative told us that it was going to be $100 euros per bag and they took our passports and put us aside with many other people who were going through the same thing we were going through. They pretty much kept us until everyone boarded and told us that if we were going to take the flight, we needed to pay 65 euros per bag and he acted like he was doing us a favor. This was our flight to come home from a long trip, it was really late at night, and we had our six and nine year old exhausted kids with us, so we didn't see any other option than to pay them for the four bags. This is what they have on their website to pay for checked in bags. Also, during boarding time I have never seen an airline as disorganized as this one. There were no lines and they just called everyone at once. Inside the plane, there was no entertainment and the plane inside was very uncomfortable for a trans-atlantic trip. The only bright spot was that the crew was really nice to us, and they served one hot meal during the flight. Do not fly with this airline, they are not worth it, and if it is a family trip, even worse. Here are the measurements that most airlines advertise as carry on: 22 x 14 x 9 in And here is theirs: 21.7 in high X 13.8 in wide X 9.8 in deep. They are not really that much different. We had measured them before we left for the airport, as well as had carried them on several flights previously. I think what they do with the carry-ons is a scam, I will not recommend this airline to any of my colleagues, family or friends who travel quite often. I will not fly with them again!",Negative,Positive

XL Airways France,airline,Gary Brisky,2018-11-30,"Hold onto your boarding pass if you want a refund. They cancel flights. The excuse given was the plane hit the gangplank and damaged a wing so a smaller plane was sent. Having 150 passengers in JFK. They knew at 5pm there was an issue yet let us stand in line from 9pm to midnight allowing passengers to board with criteria. It appeared it was who yelled the loudest. They in fact paid three days hotel which is how long it took to get the next flight. And in line many not involved in our error were also carried over from other flights. According to the hotel staff the airline knew at 5pm there was an issue. Yet we were made to stand for three hours. So now they have my confirmation. They paid my hotel, yet I have to prove I went on the rescheduled flight by giving them my boarding pass. A e-ticket from my original ticket is not enough.

Yakutia Airlines,airline,M Keane,2018-09-24,"Moscow to Sochi. Flying Yakutia Airlines for the first time, I did not know what to expect. I flew economy, which allows you one in-cabin piece of luggage up to 10 kg within size restrictions. Boarding the aircraft, the first thing I noticed was the 737-800's aisle was very narrow. The aircraft was showing wear. I noticed the seats had ashtrays! And the two-plug receptacles for headphones (however, no inflight entertainment was offered). How old was this aircraft? That said, there was more legroom than I expected, so it was not too uncomfortable. The seat only had an airline safety card -- no magazine and no air-sickness bags (They distributed air-sickness bags to people on landing approach.) The flight left a few minutes late. When airborne, a sandwich was served. Bland chicken and cheese. When I asked for some water after the beverage service had passed, the unfriendly flight attendant acted as if I had asked for the world. The flight was relatively uneventful until the end. Our approach to Sochi was during clear skies, yet the landing was rough ... right wheel first, the left, then a hard nose down. Passengers let out a gasp as we shuddered down the runway before the pilot smoothed out our landing. I wonder if because of the age of the aircraft that it was lacking the ""state of the art"" avionics that most aircraft have which make such landings rare nowadays. I fly relatively frequently and it has been a long time since I had such a landing. In the end, we made it safely. For a national/regional mid-to-small airline I would rank it as average. It was what you expect when flying economy on such a carrier.",Negative,Positive

Seat pitch tight for someone over 180cm limited seat recline - good enough for 2h 30min flight would have been worse for long-haul. Video on safety procedures was running during take-off.

Not only is this weight rather unreasonable, the policy of weighing backpacks is completely ridiculous. It allowed them to have us pay an additional 110€ to check in another bag. They should have at least allowed people on a return ticket to fly back the same way they came. But it’s obviously a great way to make extra money which is earning them customers who will not take more flights with them. Additionally the food is abysmal, they don’t let you choose veg or non-veg and they served us a full-on dinner at 9:30 in the morning. The second meal was a tiny hot pocket.

LOT Polish Airlines733 Reviews,airline,3 reviewsMakoto Hashimoto,2024-09-16,"TOKYO/NRT to WAW with LO80 on 17 AUG and back with LO79 on 29 AUG, in Business Class for both legs. I took the LOT flight for the first time in 4 and a half years. Before boarding, I knew LOT’s long-haul business class seat remains unchanged from my previous flight. That was why I thought I could get a tight sleep on a fully lie-flat bed despite no privacy around it. Something strange happened, however. The story is as follows. LO80 departs from NRT at 22:50. After taking off, I reclined my seat to the lie-flat position and fell asleep. In a couple of hours, I woke up. Surprisingly, I found my cell phone missing. I searched for it for 15 minutes but in vain. A neighbor advised me to ask for some help from a flight attendant and I followed her advice. In the meantime he came. He adjusted back my seat to the original position and took off the seat cushion deftly. I felt relieved that he had salvaged it from deep inside. It fell through a gap produced while I was reclining it. I aver this kind of happening is not rare because my neighboring passenger on the returning flight suffered from the same situation. Needless to say, I suggested that he ask for a flight attendant. I learned that those seats LOT still offers have a fatal flaw, that is, almost no storage room. As far as an in-flight meal goes, I propose that Japanese meal be avoided. I also remember that a female attendant looked a little puzzled when I requested an individual dinner the trouble mentioned above. They may not be accustomed to taking individual care of business class passengers. No Wi-Fi service is available, on the other hand, the in-flight entertainment is limited. That said, LOT is still attractive in that they have the extensive network in Central and Eastern Europe whose hub is Warsaw Chopin Airport and the round-trip business class fare presented by LOT between Japan and Europe is two-thirds of ones by JAL and ANA.",Negative,Positive

If you're considering flying with LOT, be very careful with their refund policies—you might end up losing your money like I did. I will not be flying with them again.",Positive,Negative
Read more,airline,Esther Simmendinger,2025-01-07,"We flew to Delhi and only on the way back they asked us to weigh our backpacks. Apparently backpacks can only weigh 2 kg. Not only is this weight rather unreasonable, the policy of weighing backpacks is completely ridiculous. It allowed them to have us pay an additional 110€ to check in another bag. They should have at least allowed people on a return ticket to fly back the same way they came. But it’s obviously a great way to make extra money which is earning them customers who will not take more flights with them. Additionally the food is abysmal, they don’t let you choose veg or non-veg and they served us a full-on dinner at 9:30 in the morning. The second meal was a tiny hot pocket. The toilets also became incredibly disgusting after a few hours with paper running out etc.",Negative,Positive

I took the LOT flight for the first time in 4 and a half years. Before boarding, I knew LOT’s long-haul business class seat remains unchanged from my previous flight. That was why I thought I could get a tight sleep on a fully lie-flat bed despite no privacy around it. Something strange happened, however. The story is as follows. LO80 departs from NRT at 22:50. After taking off, I reclined my seat to the lie-flat position and fell asleep. In a couple of hours, I woke up. Surprisingly, I found my cell phone missing. I searched for it for 15 minutes but in vain. A neighbor advised me to ask for some help from a flight attendant and I followed her advice. In the meantime he came. He adjusted back my seat to the original position and took off the seat cushion deftly. I felt relieved that he had salvaged it from deep inside. It fell through a gap produced while I was reclining it. I aver this kind of happening is not rare because my neighboring passenger on the returning flight suffered from the same situation. Needless to say, I suggested that he ask for a flight attendant. I learned that those seats LOT still offers have a fatal flaw, that is, almost no storage room. As far as an in-flight meal goes, I propose that Japanese meal be avoided. I also remember that a female attendant looked a little puzzled when I requested an individual dinner the trouble mentioned above. They may not be accustomed to taking individual care of business class passengers. No Wi-Fi service is available, on the other hand, the in-flight entertainment is limited. That said, LOT is still attractive in that they have the extensive network in Central and Eastern Europe whose hub is Warsaw Chopin Airport and the round-trip business class fare presented by LOT between Japan and Europe is two-thirds of ones by JAL and ANA.",Negative,Positive

Aegean Airlines812 Reviews,airline,Petros Karageorgos,2024-12-21,"I had booked my ticket and probably because of the touch screen because of the automatic writing an error occurred and my surname was not correct. All the other details were done correctly. So when yesterday I went to the airport the person at the bag drop told me that I had to contact with the customer service of the airline company to do the necessary because of the mistake with my surname. I called them and unfortunately for my surprise the responsible of the company informed me that I had to pay AGAIN a NEW TICKET at the price of 73,80€ just to rewrite correct my surname meanwhile my name, birthday, visa number and all the other were correct. It was really funny that at the same flight an employee of the company offered 250€ cash, one free ticket and a ticket to fly from Rhodes to Athens with the flight of 20:15 to a girl just because it had happened a ""problem"" with another customer of their company who flew to Athens. I wonder if there is in Europe somebody to explain to us the customers of Aegean Airlines why the company asked me to pay twice the price of my ticket just because of an error that happened probably not only to me but maybe also had happened to others. The policy of this company is at least unreasonable with the only motive how to steal money from their customers. Imagine that I have a member card of this company. The way they punish a mistake is at least ridiculous. Probably they think that we leave in the '80s where there was not the information we can all of us have. Hope not to use their services in the future just because of the way they think they can treat to their card members.",Negative,Positive
