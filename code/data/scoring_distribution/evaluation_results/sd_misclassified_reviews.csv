Aalborg,airport,3 reviewsThomas Rune Knudsen,9/16/2023,"This airport is always a breeze. Small and compact but with ok facilities considering the size. Staff is (almost) always friendly and down-to-earth. Few if any lines. Clean, and good Wi-Fi. They might need security in the baggage reclaim as two toddlers got on the belt just as it started moving. Seemed very dangerous, and the parents were present but completely oblivious. Never seen such bad parenting at an airport before. The family was Danish. Parking is no longer free, but 20 DKK per day. A very silly move.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Aalborg,airport,4 reviewsAnnika Fredenstrand,3/19/2017,"The baggage claim areas have obviously been merged to one since I last flew into Aalborg Airport with luggage. When coming to the only baggage claim area in the airport, in the end of the airport, where only airlines like Norwegian used to deliver luggage, there were no signs what so ever of our SK1207 luggage arriving - and thus I stepped out of the baggage claim area - not able to reenter - and with a tiresome wait for some 30 minutes until the airport staff had located my luggage. Better signs and maybe announcements - would do a big difference!",NEGATIVE,Positive
Aalborg,airport,K Fischer,8/4/2010,Very quick check-in and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Aarhus,airport,Don Shone,3/3/2017,"This place is a dump. Miserable place with very few facilities, they rip you off with the car parking, and rip you off with the food and drink (coffee costs at least 29 kr). Duty free is small with few items and is expensive. Aalborg airport is 10 times better.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Abbotsford Intl,airport,Bryan Wang,10/8/2019,"Since most flights to and from YXX are ULCC's, my expectations are low. Lack of flight info signs. Queuing times are non-existent. Clean terminal with easy seating. Lack of shops and food inside the secure area. Wi-Fi is poor.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Aberdeen,airport,Daniel Omnes,7/1/2023,"I am writing after some weeks and with reflection of this incident. I am 82 years old and I was travelling alone to Amsterdam. At security I found myself vulnerable due to some rude behaviour from security staff. I complied with what was asked as there is zero tolerance however what I would ask is some consideration on 'courtesy and politeness' to local and international travellers at the same time which is the basics in behaviour. I have travelled widely, and this is the standard in all airports but why not in Aberdeen? There are some good people but the 2 staff members from security have tarnished the image for the whole team and department in Aberdeen, which is unfair.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Aberdeen,airport,C Hurley,5/27/2022,"The security staff at Aberdeen airport are not up to standard. Many of them are aggressive and argumentative and their main aim is not to be friendly or courteous. I have been fortunate enough to travel to many countries and I say, without hesitation that the security staff at Aberdeen airport are either the most poorly trained that I have encountered or that they are paying no attention to the training they receive. The management team needs to review the training of the security staff at Aberdeen airport urgently.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Aberdeen,airport,G Protano,7/12/2020,"The airport is clean and easy to go, the price for the drop off is high as 3 GBP. And the security staff need to be educated to dealing with passenger. Some are friendly but some are very rude and abusive. They think to have all the power of the police.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Abidjan,airport,D Sane,12/13/2017,"I have been transiting a few times recently. The airport looks clean, nice and modern, but it's very disorganised. Boarding passes are checked more than five times, while once or twice should be enough. Security screening sees long queues up into the immigration area, due to excessive scrutiny. Transit passengers need to queue to have their boarding pass checked, a practice I haven't seen anywhere else in the world. This all adds to delays, affecting connecting flights as well. For boarding Air Côte d'Ivoire, passengers are asked to wait outside of the terminal, for a bus to the plane, several destinations combined. This kind of takes away the point of checking the boarding pass five times over before completing the boarding process within the terminal. WiFi is free for just half an hour. The terminal is modern and clean, but even at this small size it already looks very overstretched. Lomé Airport does a better job of being a hub in West Africa.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Abidjan,airport,Pedro Gil,12/20/2006,I frequently travel through this airport and would note a couple of problems in an otherwise nice facility. First I've arrived on another airline and been unable to get help in the transit lounge from Air I'voire even though they are my next flight. You have to get somebody to take you to the front desk through a little back hallway and tip them. Second if you go through the passport desk they have plain clothed policemen without badges who demand your passport in the luggage area without identifying themselves. The restaurant in the departure area is much nicer than the one outside the ticket area where you check in.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Abu Dhabi,airport,4 reviewsNash Degaonkar,12/13/2024,"The Airport is pretty decent in a lot of aspects. The duty free is vast, the airport staff and security are ultra professional, helped me guide through the terminal on where to find my gate. However, the Wi-Fi experience could have been better, because doing facetime calls was a problem, considering whatsapp is not allowed. Anyhow, it is massive.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Abu Dhabi,airport,E Marsel,6/11/2024,"On 10th of June I had a connection flight from Abu Dhabi to London at 2pm at gate D43. As I knew there was an additional security check at the gate and it had never been pleasant but this time it was enough uncomfortable to me therefore i decided to share my experience. I was searched by a female security officer and her professionalism was questionable. Her First question was about my mental health. When I answered positively, she laughed. She did my fully body check without asking me about permission. For a whole time she treated me as a suspect not as a customer. She asked me about sharp items and box matches with a joyable voice. She found even my period products very suspicious as well, having a lot of fun in meantime. I had a few security checks before her that day already and a flight. She left me with anxiety level until the roof wishing me a ""good day"". When I decided to pay a good money for a good airline I expected a good customer service at the airport as well.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Abu Dhabi,airport,S Mitchell,2/29/2024,"Airport may look amazing but passport control for arrivals is a shambles. 3 people on, with massive queues and other staff hanging around chatting. One was even on his phone rather than work",NEGATIVE,Positive
Abuja,airport,M Parker,3/5/2017,"Abuja airport is closing on 7 March for 6 weeks until 18 April for reconstruction of the runway. The nearest airport to Abuja during this period is Kaduna a 3 hour drive or train ride away so getting to and from the capital of Nigeria is going to be a big hassle until the airport reopens. The only international airline currently planning to fly into Kaduna is Ethiopian - otherwise you will have to fly to Lagos and take a domestic flight to Kaduna. Abuja airport when reopened is not too bad to use (by Nigerian standards). The international terminal is not very busy so getting through is pretty painless. The domestic terminal is in the same location - check in is on one side of the internatonal terminal (for most airlines) and the actual departures area on the other side so you have to come out of the check in area and then walk past international departures and back into the departures area. The actual departures area is up an external metal staircase which is a bit of a schlep. At the top you re-enter the building go through security and are in the departures area. It's quite large and there is air-conditioning but sometimes it gets very crowded if there are lots of delayed flights (which is very common). There are some lounges you can pay to use for about N2,000 ($4) so that is well worth it if you are facing a long delay as you will get a more comfy seat, cleaner toilets, better airconditioning and a cup of tea and a biscuit. There are a couple of cafes in the main area selling mostly Nigerian food and a few shops selling the sort of things you find in any Nigerian market. To board the domestic flights you have to exit the departures area down another external metal staircase and then get in a bus or walk to your plane depending on how far away it is parked. On arrival you actually come into the International departures and arrivals building where but you have to exit to the outside to locate your transport as only passengers are allowed into the building itself. One irritating thing about the airport is the X ray bag check to enter each building so if you are flying domestic you have to go through this twice entering the building and then a 3rd time when you are going into the departures area. International arrivals can be a slow process if two international flights arrive at the same time as there is only one desk for international passport holders and a lengthy two person process where someone from state security first checks your passport and then passes it to the immigration official. Be aware that on exiting the baggage claim area in both domestic and international areas you may be asked to show your baggage claim tags so they can be compared with the tags on your bags. I can't recommend the airport but if you are travelling to Abuja it is your only option (once it reopens). It is also much easier to use than Lagos international terminal if you are arriving in Nigeria for the first time. A new international terminal is under construction and due to open later this year. At this point the current strangely laid out mixture of domestic and international should become the domestic terminal. To get from the airport to Abuja is about a 40 minute drive down a wide multilane highway. It is best to arrange a pick up in advance to avoid ending up in a rather tatty and potentially unsafe normal taxi at the airport. The cost to Abuja should be between N5,000 to N10,000 depending on the state of the taxi.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Abuja,airport,Alan Wan,2/28/2012,On arrival as we flew Business Class we were near the front of the line for immigration. Baggage did not take too long to arrive. Finding a taxi was not obvious but a friendly airport employee walked us across the car park to the taxis - make sure you agree a price in advance. When we departed Abuja although it was quiet and there was no one in front it still took an hour to check-in. Bags had to be x-rayed and PAX go through a metal detector bags then manually weighed and manually searched after which we could check- in. Due to a computer crash boarding cards were manually written - however ground staff later gave out printed cards at the gate. The business lounge was rubbish but at least the sofas were comfy. At the gate all passengers and bags were searched again - by very friendly staff.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Abuja,airport,Antonio Tettamanzy,4/14/2011,It was better than expected but can be quite messy sometimes. Currently (April 2011) the road which connects the airport to town is under maintenance and traffic at peak hours is nothing less than crazy so program yourself to go there early. In the passengers lounge there is absolutely nothing to do but a couple of convenience stores to buy soda and crackers. Toilets are decent but with no towels nor soap to wash the hands.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Accra Kotoka,airport,M Addo,6/4/2022,"Corruption Central. Its funny that Kotoko airport has an announcement stating that it doesn't condone the extortion of customers, however does not provide any means of complaints and its scary to complain to the members of staff as they may also try to extort you. Got stopped by the security at the exit on my arrival wanting to know what was in my bag and after finding out there was nothing of worthwhile value they then asked if I could ""bless a brother"". On my return, then got stopped for another ""blessing"" by an immigration officer. Honestly, for such a beautiful airport it downgrades the whole airport and does not send out an inviting message.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Accra Kotoka,airport,B Triplett,12/13/2021,"This airport, is structurally nice and clean! That's the best part. The staff are super rude, bossy, constantly looking for someone to move or push or tell to do something irrelevant to getting people where they need to go. The instructions received are short and rude! The systems and procedures are non existing, numerous people checking and rechecked and scribbling on your ticket. I had my passport, covid, and boarding pass checked 10 times after security and sitting at the gate, it's not even possible to get to the gate without all of those having been checked?",NEGATIVE,Positive
Accra Kotoka,airport,K Teague,9/21/2018,"Beautiful state of the art equipment but some poor organisation despite lots of friendly staff. Nobody tells you the procedure, join this queue then shuffle along only to be told you should have gone to the luggage weigh-in queue first. Weigh luggage then rejoin back of check in queue. Told to go to security, shuffle along for a bit then someone asks for departure card. Leave security queue, go to desk where you collect and fill departure card then rejoin back of security queue. Suggest check in desk staff give you a departure card so you will know to fill it in before going through security. Takes a while to shuffle through that and go through immigration departure check then security check. All took about one and a half hours. At gate we were divided into groups 1-5. Not enough seats for group 5 although most passengers are in this group. Infrastructure is very impressive and no doubt they will eventually streamline procedures. Sign posting would be a good start. Shopping and dining facilities are mostly not yet open so I cannot comment on this aspect yet. So, first taste of new terminal: not half bad. Clean, spacious, excellent kit, friendly staff but poor procedures.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Accra Kotoka,airport,Klaus Malling Olsen,3/7/2016,"During rush-hours (evening) Kotoka Airport felt very crowded, but check-in was surprising quick, as well as security check, this works well if you arrive at least 3 hours before departure. Rush hours here mean departure within half an hour for several wide-body plans, creating a severe lack of seating and extremely long rows of slowly boarding passengers, making you realize that you are in a far too small airport to handle several aircrafts with a capacity of 3-400 passengers within a short time limit. Thi is especially the case when you arrive. The rows of arriving passengers at the immigration was long enough to last for almost one hour, and was followed by usual slow deliverance of luggage. Furthermore, the staff controlling the yellow cards for vaccinations are not very well inset in the rules, including the knowledge that persons over a certain age are not required vaccination against yellow fever. However, as a whole Kotoka was not too bad an experience, just accept some more time than required in more updated and modern airports.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Accra Kotoka,airport,Hans Gross,12/23/2013,This time it took 2 hours instead of the usual half hour for landing and immigration. The huge delay was caused first by a 'parking problem' for the aircraft second by the malfunction of 2 of the 3 luggage conveyor belts. For the return embarkation Emirates with its 300-seater had set the check-in period to from 12.30 am (instead of the usual 3.30 pm) until 5.30 pm which did not prevent a delay again of 1 hour for the take-off at 8 pm. The main annoyances of this airport have persisted over the last 10 years: Passengers may enter soaked with sweat and cannot have a shower (I go to the Landing restaurant and try to wipe myself in the toilet room). The sweating continues in the departure hall which is only half air-conditioned. Announcements can barely be understood as there is a cacophony stemming from the sound of TV's and the voices of passengers. It also remains amusing to count the number of passenger controls and checks: there are 4 by the airline and about 6 by other airport staff.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Adana,airport,Robert Clark,5/17/2006,"Adana Airport is a chaotic airport at best yet not as bad as airports in other countries that surround it. There are two terminals to the Adana Airport Domestic and International. In most cases the International side is only for the pilgrimage flights to Makkah Saudi Arabia and some limited flights into Northern Cyprus. The Domestic side starts with citizens wanting to take your bags up to the security screening (right at the entrance to the terminal). They will expect a tip for this very small action. Tell them ""hayir saa olun"" and you'll be left alone. You'll put your bags onto the belt and your passport will be checked. Even if you are flying domestically have your passport on you at all times. They will check the validity of your visa and if you have over-extended your welcome. Once you are through (P.S. Security does not speak English so bring some phrases with you) you will have to go to the airline of your choice. Even if you have no luggage and paper tickets you will still have to check in. Organized chaos is the best way I can put it. Regardless if you are flying Turkish Pegasus or Onur Air you will still have people cutting in line using Hefty bags as luggage and uncomfortable closeness. When you finally get to the front the people at the ticket counter normally speak english. MAKE SURE you ask if your bags get taken all the way. Some times they do - sometimes they don't. You may have to pick them back up in Istanbul so its important they make it clear. Once you are done you are left in a terminal that reeks of a foul Turkish soguk gone bad sick passengers that don't cover their mouths when they cough passengers that make that disgusting ""spit like a man"" sound and the ever famous stare. There is a smoking section but it is not seperate from any other room so non-smokers will be subjected to 2nd hand smoke. There is a small store that sells refreshments but does not open until 6am while some flights are much earlier. You'll be hard pressed for a seat so get to the airport early or get used to standing. Keep an eye on your things at all times. Lots of people look suspicious. The loudspeaker is hard to understand in this dimly lighted building and its usually only in Turkish. Just line up whenever everyone else does and try to sneak a peak at their ticket to see if it is your flight. You will go through a second security and enter the gate area. Once again - organized chaos. There is no ""area calling"" and to ""rows 1-10."" Its a massive cattle heard. Just try to get in the front. Once your identity and ticket are checked you will walk out onto the tarmac where you will see a bunch of suitcases (and Hefty bags) This is where is can get confusing. Before you can board the place you must claim your suitcase yet again and give it to the baggage handlers. I guess this is good since you do ensure it gets on the plane but if its a large flight it can be difficult in the dark to find your items. DEPARTURE INTERNATIONAL: Should you get lucky enough and go through immigration in Adana it is much easier than Istanbul. The Duty Free section is very tiny and only has alcohol and cigarettes but the customs queues are tiny in comparison to Istanbul. This may happen to you even if you are going through Istanbul to an international flight so it is always best to check over at International first to see if you leave from there or domestic. For your sake I hope you leave Internationally. ARRIVAL: Landings are pretty simple. If you go through customs (there will only be like 10 of you) you will go through a small customs kiosk your passport will be scrutinized and you'll get to have a rare ""Adana"" stamp in your passport unlike most who travel to Turkey with the ""Istanbul"" stamp. Your bags will come on a low riding baggage claim separate from the domestic fliers and quick out the door. If you are flying in domestically (or after checking into customs in Istanbul) you will have to wait quite a long time before the bags finally arrive onto the low riding baggage claim. In here is where you can rent a car as well about 4 companies are available on site and for those going to the NATO base there is a Hertz located in the Burger King. Back to the airpoort when you get outside you can be picked up by your people (they will not be allowed into the airport) or you can hire a taxi. A gentleman usually brings the taxi to you and loads your bags he will expect a tip. 2 YTL is good enough. P.S. - A good taxi (spelled taksi in Turkish) to go with would be Gate Taxi at +90(322)316TAXI - they speak English. It will cost more but the drivers have better English than the airport taxis) In the airport just dial 322316TAXI. One more thing before I forget - turn around whern you enter the terminal - you'll see the lost luggage department. If you fly here to Adana more than once - expect to go in here a few times. The airport itself is a dirty mess...it smells the facilities are usually dirty it reeks of smoke and it gets pretty loud.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Addis Ababa,airport,Simon Castleman,4/9/2024,"ADD Bole airport is a zoo. On our outbound flight we arrived from London and passed through security and from there to the lounge and boarded the plane to VFA. On the way back having been through security at VFA and again during transit at ADD we had to go through security again near the gate. Not only that we then had a secondary screening and two lots of document checks. With three flights leaving within 30 minutes of each other having one person looking at documents of 700+ people is just bonkers. I can see why people miss flights at this airport if you're not aware of this. If you are leaving from gates A14-16 inclusive, which seems to be the only part of the airport where this happens, you need to leave a good 20-30 minutes in addition to whatever time you think you need to get to the actual gate.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Addis Ababa,airport,M Collie,11/4/2023,"Transit in the early morning. Lucky to have airbridges for arrival and departure. Distances between gates can be massive. Airport is very busy, but less chaotic than it appears at first sight. The biz security line made the experience less stressful.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Addis Ababa,airport,H Smart,9/29/2023,"What a shambles this airport was for our very recent transits. The bus transfer from the incoming flight took forever and by the time we got to security the approximately ten wide column of people had to go down to one to go though security. When we got to the security screening there were no boxes to put liquids, laptops etc. into, and when someone eventually appeared with a stack of them it was a free for all as there wasn't enough to go round. Having survived security we had four hours before our connection to Dar Es Salaam. There were nowhere near enough seats and no air conditioning despite how warm it was. When the gate information came up, (C6 I think it was), we went to our departure gate to find there were two flights going from the same gate before ours, so there were hundreds of people waiting at our gate along with hundreds of others waiting for several other gates all in the same row. The electronic departure board stopped working, no staff to ask for information and another slow bus transfer out to the plane. The return experience was not much better although slightly better organised at security screening. Still not enough seats and still very hot in the main areas. When we went to our gate we had to wait to be admitted to gates A14 - 16 as again there were two flights leaving that area before ours. Seats were very difficult to get and when we finally went through to A15 we had to go through another security screening with shoes and belts off, again. When boarding started it was a free for all until a man appeared and stopped anyone who wasn't in zone 2, but as no announcement was made no-one knew it was boarding by zone number. He disappeared and a lady then appeared and held up three fingers which we assumed, correctly I'm pleased to say, that zone three could board, but again, no announcement. The one good point was no bus transfer. We hope we never have to transit through Bole again.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Addis Ababa,airport,S Makukula,8/19/2023,"Few toilets in the boarding area and not enough seats. The shops were closed in the boarding area so buying a snack was a challenge. However, staff were helpful.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Adelaide,airport,Tony Crome,2/10/2025,"Adelaide Airport is an absolute joke, and I've been to every major airport in Australia dozens of times. Security is the worst I've ever seen, over 200 people trying to go through security, line stretching way back. If I could have given zero for queuing times I would've.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Adelaide,airport,M Morrison,7/5/2022,"Awful airport. Security took ages to go through and airport staff were mostly unfriendly except for one staff member who was pleasant. I travelled from London to Auckland and unfortunately had to transit via Adelaide. I had bought duty free items from London (foundations, face creams, perfume) - all within my NZ allowance and all packaged as bought with the receipt available. When going through security the staff hassled me and said I was not allowed to take the items through and they all needed to go into one clear plastic bag. I already had my travel toiletries in one clear plastic bag. The response was tough, you must choose what you want to take with or leave behind. I was definitely not leaving behind $250 worth of cosmetics! Everyone who witnessed this was appalled and agreed this was a ridiculous rule since the items were bought from duty free. I had no issue at Doha airport with the items. Fortunately I had fellow travelers (strangers) on the same flight who were able to take the goods through for me. Had this not been the case they would have forced me to leave items behind. I am very upset by this incident. This was extremely distressing after 30 hours of travel. I would not recommend Adelaide for transfer if this is how they treat international travelers.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Adelaide,airport,Kelvin Teng,12/22/2019,"I understand that there is some renovation going on but the airport could do with proper signage to the various departure gates. Also, what is the point of doing double security screening before boarding the plane?",NEGATIVE,Positive
Adelaide,airport,N Schuler,10/21/2019,"I have been a frequent flyer for many years with an average flight count of around 85 flights per year for the last 14 years, nationally and international. I used to be happy coming back to Adelaide but the last 2 years arrival at Adelaide to be a horrendous experience. The level of incompetence in getting people through was simply unbelievable. To put you in the picture, this experience I am going to describe happend almost the same on my last 3 international flights, all this year. So, my plane arrived first, a standard A380, followed 25 minutes later by another small international flight. Getting of the plane - quick, getting through passport control - quick and that is where the good part finishes. The luggage took 48 minutes to arrive, on 1 luggage carousel. By the time my bag arrived the queue was returning 3 times around the carousel, you could not even get to the end. Only one office checked the arrival card of every one, talked and saw the growing line building up. She send at least 60% through a line to be checked, and after another 15 minutes in the queue she did that to me too, even though I am APEC member. Another 12 minutes wait before the Officer could attend to me, x-rayed my bag and send me through. I was not allowed to inform my waiting driver (no phones or texting allowed) and he left by the time I came out over an hour later, so I had to join the Taxi queue. I have been to many bad managed airports, Rome, Dhaka, Athens, etc., but Adelaide is the undisputed champion for the worst international arrival service I have experienced. Better arrive from your international leg in Melbourne and take a domestic flight to Adelaide, you will be faster.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Agadir,airport,Kevin Maslin,8/11/2008,No major problems here. Lots of check-in desks open at inbound passport control so we were processed fairly quickly and directed to the transfer coach within 20 mins. Lots of 'porters' in brown uniform with trolleys offered to take our luggage when we disembarked from the coach on the return journey. We could manage ok but I think they were asking for 10 Dirham (about 70p) to take you all the way to check-in which I considered to be fairly reasonable. We were told that we could not spend our left over Dirhams in the departure lounge so we changed them at the bank (not for sterling but to euros!) in the lobby prior to joining the queue for the scanning machine. As there was only one channel in operation it took quite a while to get through and then we discovered that the shops would accept sterling euros or dirhams! Ho-hum. We had taken our own drinks through as we had been told the airport prices were shockingly expensive (even the so-called duty-free!) but we did buy 3 Snickers bars at 4.5 euros! We were not aware that our flight was overdue by half an hour as announcements were largely in French fairly inaudible and the screens were not very informative. Once the gate was open though we were ushered through to the plane quite quickly.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Agadir Al Massira,airport,Alan Edwards,3/13/2006,As far as looks go this is good. The rest is average and below arriving luggage arrived reasonable quickly then immigration long wait then the form given on flight thoroughly checked. Departure no Morrocan currency allowed flight side payment in about anything accepted and change given in same staff efficient under the circumstances prices high. Information on flight delays non existant room just sufficient for passengers on 757 charter flight Regarding passport/immigration control on departure. If you have a rollerball pen visible be prepared for the officer wanting to swap pens! Despite these negative comments you do feel the staff are trying.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Ahmedabad,airport,Satyam Parmar,8/18/2023,"Poor quality of services, no trolley at arrival area, instead staff asking for paid services. Long line in security check in with only few counters opened. Staff behavior is like, they are doing mercy on us to allow traveling “Atithi Devo Bhav” is very poorly experienced at the airport. The management should look for this.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ahmedabad,airport,3 reviewsS Hayle,4/24/2023,I love flying out of Ahmedabad airport said no one ever. Well maybe someone will next year when the new terminal opens but for now we have to deal with an overcrowded crumbling building. Best thing you can do is limit your time here. There is also no domestic transfer channel so you have to exit and start again,NEGATIVE,Positive
Ajaccio,airport,Nick Strohecker,5/29/2019,"Although the airport itself is fine, the security agents are rude, inconsistent, and not bright. Trekking poles were deemed weapons, thus not allowed on the flight, but only some. Other poles, of the exact same type, size, everything, were confiscated by guards that seemed to enjoy their limited power to taint one's vacation. If one needs to bring poles or anything similar through security, I recommend faking a limp or hope that the main jerks are on a lunch break.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ajaccio,airport,O Beyr,10/20/2008,Nice little airport right next to the sea and beaches. There is not much you can expect during waiting time it is only a regional airport. Only point of criticism: access to security control. At the time I was there queues formed randomly without any guidance between around and between counters which led to some confusion and aggression as some people got away without waiting.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Ajaccio,airport,Alistair Peckham,8/3/2008,Good efficient airport but suffers from heavy summer traffic and due to the size of the airport there can be delays just due to the amount of flights which the airport can not handle. Also not the best allocation of seats. Security staff were very pleasant and polite. Also not many cues or waits for security or boarding.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Akita,airport,Diogo Leite,7/9/2015,"Very small airport. Domestic part is small but has everything we need, of course only one or two varieties in each aspect. International with only three flights per week is even more small, but before immigration (biggest problem there when arriving, big queues with two or three counters) it is connected inside with the domestic. Difficult to access, only taxi or bus from Akita City.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Akron–Canton,airport,Sandra Dragomir,1/26/2024,"If you have an early flight, do not expect to be able to get coffee. There is a coffee shop, but it is never open. You can get coffee at 6 AM at every other airport. Why not here?",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Al Ula,airport,Vesa Laeaekkoe,9/7/2022,"Al Ula is one of the top tourist destinations in Saudi Arabia and this new airport serves that area. Currently they have only a few flights per day to other Saudi cities and to Dubai so terminal is quite small, it has only 2 departure gates, few shops and cafes, car rental and a tourist desk. Very stylish building actually and everything is done fast since there are not many passengers around, with exception of renting a car. There is no commuter traffic and very few taxis, so renting a car is quite mandatory. It took an hour to get my car because of the queue and bureaucracy. Nevertheless experience was good and this region is very beautiful with lots of history.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Albuquerque,airport,J Heares,10/16/2023,Only wall outlets and had to try 3 different ones to find one that worked. It's 2023 and everyone needs to charge their devices. First trip to Albuquerque.

Albuquerque,airport,S Theale,5/7/2022,"I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled security. Initially I was thrilled at the process and not separating people from their luggage like so many others. However, one of my bags got 'flagged' (ended up being for a stack of business cards) and it sat waiting to be checked for over 15 minutes. During that time I asked 4 different people about it and was brushed off with comments like 'They're sending someone over' or 'I'm sure they'll take care of it"" and they just walked off. It almost made me miss my flight and was just completely NOT okay. If they had even spoken to me and treated me like a person that mattered it would have been more palatable, but this negative experience will override any positive about this airport.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Albuquerque,airport,39 reviewsW Jackson,4/19/2022,"ABQ is a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements. For starters: If you have TSA Pre-Check here, you're golden. Security is an efficient and friendly process. If you don't have Pre-Check, then the service, at least for a small airport, can be quite non-communicative, abrasive and slow. The pueblo-inspired architecture and interior design of the airport render it one of the most beautiful small airports in the USA, and the post-security viewing area of the runway and mountains is the sort of thing that more airports in this country need. However, it's not always easy to enjoy the design and the views when the tile and carpet flooring and seating throughout the airport are dirty and, for a lack of better words, dilapidated and outdated. Speaking of seating, there really isn't enough of it, in my opinion. The signage directing you to amenities, services and locations throughout the airport is helpful, but also outdated. The dining and shopping options are fine for a small airport, so no real complaints. Some people complain about the rental car facility being separate from the terminal and requiring a shuttle bus, but, honestly, the bus runs frequently and the ride is pretty short. Everything is easily accessible from I-25 and downtown Albuquerque. With a little modernization and polishing, ABQ has the potential be as good as new again.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Albury,airport,H James,10/11/2022,My carry on bag was confiscated because it was 8mm bigger than the fitting cage that the check in people use. After many thousands of flights all over the world with dozens of airlines for 50 years I have never had a carry on bag confiscated. Albury Airport and Rex Airlines should be ashamed of their procedures. There was absolutely nothing wrong with my confiscated bag and it was definitely not oversized.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Alexandria Intl,airport,David Taylor,10/22/2022,Do not arrive too early. We arrived 3 hours before-my friend was flying on a slightly earlier flight and I was told to wait outside as my flight was slightly later. No preliminary information.so had to wait an hour. Finally allowed inside the building where there were 5 security checks - really strange as the checks involved the same things. After all that my friends plane was still on the tarmac as we took off. Airport was clean and seemed well organised once inside but being kept outside was risky.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Alghero Fertilia,airport,Gary Rushworth,5/25/2023,"Slow bag drop, called us through passport control to the gates about 2 hours before the flight into the boarding gates, which had very little seating and no priority seating for disabled/pregnant passengers.

Alghero Fertilia,airport,N Marsien,8/28/2021,Well the airport is small so no comment there. Toilets pretty clean. However there’s a bus every hour. The bus driver doesn’t sell tickets so I missed my bus at 9am for having to go back inside find the ticket machine somewhere and stay in a queue and buy it. There’s no shade for the people and there are lots of children and pregnant women. Information point nowhere to be seen.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Alghero Fertilia,airport,Nicola Ruggeri,3/9/2018,"Small airport but very functional, unfortunately a little shabby and with few flights and only seasonal.

Algiers,airport,1 reviewsT Peters,10/14/2016,Algiers airport transit from Spain to Qatar. Despite the Algeria embassy in Madrid telling us that a transit visa wasn't mandatory I recommend you to take it with you. There isn't an special way for transits. You must cross the passport control to enter Algeria and another passport control to go to your departure gate. It`s a quite slow process(30 min+). Also 3 security scans. The airport is small with a very interesting mix of cultures. The restaurants only accept cash in local currency (there is a bank in the terminal). Airport staff very helpful. Very dirty WC. New terminal under construction.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Algiers,airport,9 reviewsAndre Bouzid,10/28/2015,"Arrival from London was fine but the immigration hall was packed and it took a bit of time to get through. Baggage claim is always a nightmare at Houari Boumidienne airport (Algiers) because everyone has so many huge bags and the system isn't very efficient. Connections to the city are ok but we got a taxi. On the way back, check in had a very long line. But since we had online check-in, they allowed to go into Club Europe's queue though the way the agents work so lethargically, it wasn't much quicker. Immigration was smoother than on arrival. Security was separated by gender which annoyed some less conservative Algerians. I have to say we got the timing spot on as we were able to buy some Algerian wine and after a few minutes, we were boarding. But then, there is more security after the boarding gate which slows everything down as the X-ray kept breaking. What I personally don't like about Algiers airport is that there is so much ""security"" when in fact, the officers behind the screen are just chatting and laughing, barely looking at the screen. Overall, it is an ordinary airport with nothing particularly good but not bad either.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Alicante,airport,1 reviewsDavid Hughes,6/5/2022,Arrived at the same time as another flight at 01.30. None of the automatic passport readers was open.

Alice Springs,airport,Sandi Adamson,3/1/2024,Nice airport but it's the slowest for unloading passengers and luggage. I'm here frequently and it does my head in how slow it is! Please look into this.

Alice Springs,airport,14 reviewsO Martin,3/8/2018,"A small airport in the dead centre of Australia. The airport is a modern concrete building with plenty of glass. Just past the luggage carousel, there were many desks helping tourists to their next stop or journey. As it was internal flight, we walked straight to the luggage carousel. The luggage duly arrived, but not our hosts. We waited in the hot exteriors for our host and we could see the whole airport being shut down. It is a very quiet airport indeed.",POSITIVE,Negative

The same at the passport control. Waiting area for departure is too small. On the way to the aircraft you have to deal with no escalators and elevators are too small.

Almaty,airport,18 reviewsAiyaphol Kemapuckpong,9/2/2016,"Most of the flights use the gates, but even though they are empty many low-cost flights (all except Air Astana, Etihad etc) use the ramps. The staff were reasonably friendly, and the immigration process was no bother compared to Tashkent Airport. The airport itself is too small. One of my friends in Business class decided to not use the lounge because it was just rubbish. The staff don't really care if the people in the business class lounge talk loudly or anything. The airport's check-in could be improved, and the domestic arrivals hall has too many taxi drivers trying to find customers. Food choice is also limited, but the duty free was actually pretty decent. However, I would not use this airport again, but I have to next year.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Almaty,airport,4 reviewsHerbert Poenisch,7/31/2016,"Agree with other reports that this airport lacks most of the conveniences which a frequent traveller expects. What is worse is that the Airport authorities don't take any of these comments seriously. Even frequent travelers qualifying for a lounge are disappointed, as the lounge lacks free drinks, free food and internet access. The staff just does not care. Avoid this airport if you can.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Almeria,airport,Stuart Ward,7/10/2011,Interesting to see the airport since last year. Inbound passport has moved further indoors so no queuing on the road but still slow processing. There's an escalator to passports now which had a log jam at the top when we arrived so some guy had to rush out and switch it off otherwise there would be a pile of passengers at the top! Baggage arrived about 20mins after flight landed. Outbound speedy check in and security. Roof terrace still not open nothing has changed since last October.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Almeria,airport,Stuart Ward,10/24/2010,Arrival okay queue to go through passport was a bit long. Luggage arrived on the belt as we got though. Limited baggage handlers so for a full charter flight might be longer. About 25 mins from landing to getting in the taxi. Going out the departure hall has been rebuilt much better and quicker. Security still tight big queue to get through. The departure lounge has been rebuilt and access to the rooftop terrace removed. The lounge is much better than the original. As work is going on don't know if there are plans to restore access to the roof. Small snack bar with coffee and rolls at reasonable prices but duty free for local stuff is the same price as supermarkets and imported stuff is more expensive than UK supermarket prices. Wouldn't want to arrive or depart when there are more than 2 charter/scheduled UK flights though. Then it would get overloaded very quickly.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Almeria,airport,S William,3/25/2007,Almeria was unfortunately not built to handle the amount of traffic using it. There is only one runway which means deays in departure if there are several arrivals. The terminal facilities are sufficient in the low season but when the charters are at full peak it is woefully inadequate. The limited number of check-in desks means that when several flights are being loaded often only one or perhaps two desks are available for each. There is a real bottleneck at the one and only security entrance. Information is poor even when it is obvious that flights are late the original time is left showing on the monitors. The departure lounge is small and with only one cafe which offers a very limited selection of food and drink. There is however a large open roof seating area with lift and stair access with excellent views of the apron and runway with a cafe which opens when the airport is busy. The only bus link is crowded with non-airport passengers as already described by an earlier contributor and doesn't end at the combined bus/rail station but some 400 metres away in town. A taxi to the centre is only 8 - 10 Euros.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Almeria,airport,Dan Thorneycroft,8/25/2006,Reading some of the other reports of Almeria airport I have to say that I must have been lucky on the twenty or so times I have used the airport because I have not had any problems to complain about. The only serious problem which needs to be highlighted is the pilfering of baggage which happens. In view of the serious security problems at British airports someone in a foreign airport who can steal items from baggage could just as easily be putting something in! Almeria to Stansted appears to be the main problem and whilst the pilfering could be taking place at Stansted this is unlikely due to the limited amount of time the bags are available to the people doing the pilfering. The bags are out of sight at Almeria for up to 1.5 hours before the flight.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Almeria,airport,Mohd Kastor,5/31/2006,A small airport with limited but more than enough facilities. The immigration control area is very small with only one counter; resulted in a long queue extending to the outside of the arrival's entrance door. In the departure hall try to get anything you want (food newspaper souvenir etc.) before passing through security. Once airside there are only one small duty free shop and one very small cafe; boring poorly stocked and expensive!,NEGATIVE,Positive
Amarillo,airport,Andrew Levy,1/7/2005,AMA has 2 passenger concourses but nearly all passengers must use the north concourse (serving the 30-series gates) serving American Eagle Continental Express and Southwest. The northwest concourse (serving the 20-series gates) is largely unused. As a result security screening at the north concourse is prone to long back-ups. One thought is for the airport to modify some leases and reassign tenants in order to ensure that the entire terminal is more uniformly utilized which would reduce terminal congestion.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Amman Queen Alia,airport,2 reviewsMacit Samarah,8/17/2024,The airport has a nice design but it is not well maintained and you always feel it’s aging fast. The waiting time to reach immigration might take more than an hour in summer while bags might take on average 45 minutes in non-peak times. Duty free is good and the RJ lounge is very good with plenty of options. Toilet and hygiene facilities don’t have consistent standard,NEGATIVE,Positive
Amman Queen Alia,airport,Uwe Schmitt,7/26/2023,First time in Jordan we had to change the airplane at Amman airport. The experience at the security check was not a good one.

Amritsar,airport,Julie Shah,1/26/2019,Absolutely barbaric officials! Me and my friend had 2 days in Amritsar visiting the sites and were overwhelmed by the friendliness of the local people. That was until it was time to leave and the overall experience of the airport. Who on earth do these people think they are and how they are allowed to treat people the way they do. They are a disgrace to humanity and need to be brought into check. Not one nice official at this airport.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Amritsar,airport,Sunny Singh,3/28/2016,I fly every year to Amritsar from London but to my disappointment the aerobridge gate has not been used for 3-4 years.

Once in the departure lounge area we sat for hours as our flight was delayed. We received no information and there was no electronic information board to provide us with updates. No verbal announcements either. We just sat. When we questioned airport staff, they had no more information than we did. This is not how a modern airport should run. In addition to this, there should be more affordable refreshments on sale as the airline (Turkmenistan Air) wasn't going to give us any. There should also be free WiFi for us to use our mobile phones. Other than that it was an OK airport. More cheap and drinks would help.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Amsterdam Schiphol,airport,Francesca Muizelaar,9/2/2024,"Schiphol has numerous eGates, automatic self-service border checkpoints. It is easy to cross the border faster than with a manual inspection because you scan your own passport. YET, most of the time 50% or more of these are out of service generating long queues.

TSA check in was friendly and efficient on our departure. You need better Wifi.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Anchorage,airport,M McManus,10/16/2011,Went to Anchorage in late 2011. Airport has some restaurants on the security side of the airport but not a good choice and the quality was not too good. The gift shops on the other hand are excellent especially if you are looking for Native American art. Be warned that quite a few souvenirs are like snow shakers with water which will be taken off you by security if you need to pass through them again. Information screens were useful. Plenty of seating and quite a view out of the terminal window.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Ancona,airport,Stephen Smith,9/12/2022,"Very clean Airport, friendly helpful staff, great that it’s all on one level. My departure was late 11.00pm and was disappointed in the fact that the duty free shop was closed. Also it took a while for the cafe bar to open and I wanted a pizza slice heated up which the assistant was reluctant to do , but I said I would wait. When we got through passport control all seating was taped off so a huge bunch of passengers, and some sitting in the floor. No staff around for about 20 mins. Some passengers lifted up the tape to sit down so a majority followed only to be asked to move out 10 mins later. Also no Air conditioning so it was hot and sweaty. So I would say this Airport is not good for later flights.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ankara,airport,Mohd Shabsog,6/3/2023,"During the midnight of 3rd/4th of June during a transit flight, I had the displeasure of dealing with a poorly coordinated security team. Under normal circumstances I would highly recommend this airport as I have traveled through it before. To put things in context, I was on a transit trip that had a 1 hour period between the departure of the arrival from the earlier destination and the departure of the subsequent flight. Given the time constraint, one would imagine there to be a better overall coordination among the staff. There was particularly poor coordination between those who worked at security checks and those at passport control. The staff at security checks not only allowed over 15 people to cut through the long queue sporadically without any consequence or moderation, they also performed unnecessary performative “passport checks” (granted we had already done actual complete passport around 5 meters earlier). A lot of the questions asked seemed performative as well, it seemed as if they were more interested in it the appearance of doing their job while simultaneously doing it at a slow pace without maintaining any sense of order. Thankfully, it did not cost me the flight but I would urge there to be better coordination in the future as I’m fully aware from previous experience that the staff at the airport can do better.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ankara,airport,1 reviewsT Edmond,1/5/2018,"Esenboğa Airport is not as big as Ataturk Airport and you can find everything very quickly and easily. I think this is the best way of using this airport. Airport is bit far away from the city center and people don't have cheap and fast options to get to this airport so sometimes passengers spend more time travelling to the airport. Finally, parking areas of Esenboğa Airport are very expensive, small and complicated. Generally passengers spend more than 15 minutes finding a parking place.",NEGATIVE,Positive

I can't say anything about queues being a transit passenger. There was so many flies at the airport so terminal was not so clean. Hard, metal seating of terminal was bad if you have to wait more then 3 hours to my experience. There was a coffee shop with better seating though prices were high. If you want to have a meal at the airport, keep in mind that prices are very high than outside of the airport. Shops are not many but you can satisfy your basic needs if you choose. Staff was somewhat invisible at night and not helpful at day. Wifi at coffee shop was free but I didn't find any other free wifi. Flights were generally delayed due to planes lining up to take off.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ankara,airport,8 reviewsEd Roggeveen,8/9/2015,"A very large airport with not many flights! There were heaps of gates not being used. The airport itself though was very nice, clean with lots of places for food and beverages, although service at a couple of those places left a bit to be desired. There was also a little play area near our gate for our son. We hired a trolley from outside but there was nowhere to drop it off inside - you had to go out and then go back in via security so we just abandoned ours in the hall! Several other people had done the same and we saw someone gather them - a small thing that can be easily fixed. Security very fast and nice man on duty.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ankara,airport,D Turkalj,4/18/2011,Very nice airport however just a few international airlines operating. Domestic always full due to Istanbul flights.

Poor standards all over the place.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Antalya,airport,F Reade,9/10/2024,"Without doubt, the worst airport I have visited. I'll be straight and honest. We will return again as Side in Turkey is an amazing town. But I'm sure this region deserves a better airport. It's like a cattle market with nowhere near enough seating if you plan on eating. And that's just the start. Tin of local lager (Effes) €12. Unbelievable. Small wine €11. Blamed on Inflation, yet the shop directly across from these stalls(photo attached) same wine, €3.50. Bottles of IPA beer €4.00 So, more likely extortion. And if you are lucky enough to get a seat to sip your vastly overpriced sandwich & drink, you'll be surrounded by thousands of wandering passengers begging for a seat to consume their golden meal.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Antalya,airport,N Carlan,9/5/2024,"Antalya airport is the most expensive airport I have ever been to. The prices are extortionate, for anything from the duty free to the various cafes and fast food restaurants, for the price you expect the food to be at least hot, the food was cold and stale. I just do not understand how they can charge so much for bad quality food. I understand airports are expensive but this was a different level of expensive. The rest of the airport is alright, easy to find where you’re going and helpful staff. You did have to go through double security once at the door and after you check in your luggage, so be mindful to not buy any drinks from downstairs. Also there is no airport WiFi you have to pay. Overall I will not be returning to Antalya because even outside of the airport prices are extortionate and vendors do not know how to trade in their own currency of lira. Everything is in Euros.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Antalya,airport,A Davies,8/31/2024,"Fairly straight forward on arrival but as others have said, departures is a bit of a joke. Very badly organised, zero aircon (probably to make you buy more drinks), massively over crowded with limited seating, no wifi, and the food and drink charges are utterly criminal. We paid £28 for 3x bags of chips from burger king. We also had 3x separate security checks including myself and 4yo boy being selected for ""random"" bag searches at the gate by possibly the most disinterested security team you'll ever witness. We had a great holiday overall but this airport really is a bit of a stain on the whole experience.",NEGATIVE,Positive

I agree with everything recently written but add a few additional points. 1) Watch out for the Euro coin scammers. Locals trying to exchange euro coins for notes. They will show you 20 Euros in coins and ask for a note in exchange. They are expert at a sleight of hand confidence trick. You will not get the correct change once they count it out for you. 2) There is a cafe on the first floor of international departures that is open 24x7 and is the only non-airside seating area. Particularly useful if your flight is delayed and are awaiting check in to open. 3) The Duty Free was open until 0100 am for the Air France Paris flight 4) I flew Kenyan Airlines to Nairobi, this was a flight originating in Mozambique or Reunion but assigned seat was not available as the transiting passengers were already stretched out over all seats. It ended up as a free for all for the remaining free seats.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Antananarivo,airport,C Nelson,8/23/2016,"Madagascar is a wonderful country but Antananarivo airport is so poor that it really makes visiting a trial. For entry I counted that my passport was checked 6 times from leaving the aircraft until finally getting into our taxi. No idea why, but it took a long time. You must have the entry fee (around 25 euros per person for short stay) in cash (Euros, Dollar and Pounds accepted). If you don't, staff escort you landside to a cash point and bring you back. There are numerous stamps and writing and more queuing, all of which seems totally superfluous. People that look like staff often aren't and are the 'porters'. They are very aggressive - there's no point trying to take your own bag, unless it's strapped to you as they take it and then expect to be paid. It is also very difficult to keep it to just 1 porter, again expecting to be paid. I know it's a poor country, but some regulation of these porters is required, especially coming airside. I suppose overall, the time to clear wasn't that bad as they saved that for the exit. Again, there was the obsession with passport checks - 5 times it was checked, as well as my finger prints being taken - no idea why on exit, but not on entry. That wasn't the worst - our hotel delivered us 2 hours and 30 mins before the departure. We were about half way down the check-in queue. The plane had a capacity of 89 people. Checking-in took 2 hours. The cabin bags had labels too - not required in other locations. Some people seemed to have a check-in form, but we didn't need one. After that, then they said a form had to be filled-in, with lots of totally irrelevant information. Similar to the form on entry with info like where you stayed. The form wasn't available whilst you queued for check-in. Another member of staff then turned up, offering a pen and wanting to be paid - we had no currency left by then. Then there were more checks and the finger print scan. A baggage check until finally getting through to departures. By the time we got through, the plane was already boarding, so I didn't see the departure lounge. In the end the plane was 30 mins late departing due to these delays. Overall a really poor experience, which would be so easy to improve. My recommendation is to keep your bags close (not for security reasons), be very specific what help you need / want and for departures, be there 3 hours in advance.",NEGATIVE,Positive

No really worth going off site, or so we thought. Scarcely any seats and those available were not suitable for long delays, but nothing else was available. The tiny cafe closed about ten minutes after our arrival mid-afternoon. The excuse given was 'it's Sunday'. No water machine or vending machine available. The A/C worked over efficiently and it was bitterly cold. After an efficient check in and passage through normal airport procedures, enter into the departure area. This is large and open with the potential for many outlets and stores. However very few are in use, really no more than were in the original old terminal. We were told that rents are excessive and that is why few are in use. Prices were excessive - $8 for a small bottle of water. In summary, the airport works efficiently as far as boarding airplanes is concerned but not for passengers with long waits, either inside or outside departures. WiFi is very good.",NEGATIVE,Positive

First of many check in’s doesn’t open until 0830 but the one employee checking people in wasn’t ready until 0845. Long line by then. Very strange process to go through X-ray line twice. If this were a better organized process, this could happen once",NEGATIVE,Positive
Aruba Reina Beatrix,airport,P Geyre,8/31/2022,"Stood in horrible lines for more than 3 hours. Completely unnecessary! Absolutely no organization, staff never gave explanations or even good directions. One employee kept hollering for “customers, please keep moving!” As if we wanted to stand still? In several instances, we saw employees give special treatment to some by opening lines for people to bypass longer lines to join shorter ones that were completely blocked off except for this reason. The final time my husband and I saw it happen, which was opened, literally, just behind us, we snuck through too while said employee was busy looking for others (of their choosing) to go through. We were fast tracked through customs in minutes. We had not eaten before because we thought 3 1/2 hours in small airport would have left plenty of time to eat at a restaurant in the airport. Nope, I barely had time to get aunt Annie’s (while my husband used that time to take a quick trip to the bathroom, I had to use airplane toilet). We got to our gate while plane was boarding (ate on plane). As we were boarding plane I noticed people just arriving, that had been in line with us before we snuck out, 25 minutes later. Aruba, amazing time but we will never go back because of airport.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ashgabat,airport,S King,6/30/2019,"Ashgabat is a big airport with very limited traffic. Arrived very early in the morning and had to queue at the visa desk which took just on two hours. If you don't have a visa prior to arrival you can get one at the airport, the process is quite long and takes a lot of time. First you queue in the visa line and hand over document and passport. Then you queue at the cash desk which can take a lot of time to hand over the money and the tourist tax (which everyone has to pay so this line is the busiest), once done with that back to the visa desk to get the documents back (the cashier desk only accept USD some people had euros which caused some delays. They have to be post 2003 clean and crisp otherwise they won't accept it). They have fingerprint scanners which sometimes work or not. Then immigration which the guy was lovely and was very welcoming, one of the best immigration experiences I have had in a while. Your passport gets checked again before going down the escalator which has an amazing green hand rail. Luggage was waiting for me then go through customs and have passport checked again to leave. Airport officials will ask for bribes and will charge you if your unlucky they also don't give change. It's a cool airport yet it's forbidden to take photos which is strange.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Astana,airport,Adrian Pritchard,2/26/2023,"Astana Airport feels more like a bus station than an international airport. It's tiny! That said, staff are friendly and will go out of their way to help you buy and install a Sim card. There are a few of the usual taxi touts but not too many and they accept no. There are a few shops but none of those annoying overpriced boutiques which is a good thing! Wifi appeared to work.",NEGATIVE,Positive

The Immigration control was quite fast and no problems in getting a 15 day Visa on arrival. The airport is relatively new and modern. Security was efficient and effective. I had a couple of hours between flights and wanted to recharge phone and computer. There was plenty of seating but there were very few places and none adjacent to a seat where I could charge my computer. I watched it from about 10 metres away.

Astana,airport,18 reviewsAiyaphol Kemapuckpong,8/31/2016,"When I arrived at Astana Airport, the structure was reminiscent of the soviet-era. The arrivals was less organised, with the baggage claim being crammed into one spot that is too small. Check in at this airport is close to impossible, Air Astana only use two or three counters for economy class and one for business. The security check is organised, the gates are organised, the cafès are nicely organised, but the staff could speak a little bit more English. Passport control takes a little bit too long, but not as long as some airports.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Astana,airport,M Foote,9/5/2011,This airport has excellent free wifi but lacks any decent shops or restaurants. I stayed in the airport for 5 hrs whilst waiting for a connecting flight. The check-in agent wouldn't check my bag through so I was stuck at the airport. The best area for wifi is on the 2nd floor. There are power-points behind the bench seats for charging your laptop. Airside there are small shops and a cafe/bar at the very end of the departure lounge where the wifi doesn't work. As a capital city airport it is lacking in many of the things one would expect. Without the wifi it would be very hard to pass the time waiting for connecting flights.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Asuncion Silvio Pettirossi,airport,Jonathan Lacoste,2/6/2006,Asuncion is a small and simple airport. From airport gate to curbside the distance is no more than 50 meters. Upon arrival on AA (this was last month before AA cancelled their service to ASU) immigration was quick and efficient but baggage claim seemed to take forever. I must’ve waited for over 40 minutes which was unusual. Baggage claim in ASU is slow but not that slow. Be prepared when arriving into Asuncion’s baggage claim area to be swarmed by baggage porters looking to make a big tip. As soon as you tell one “no” another one will approach you. Departure wise the departure hall is not that big and can easily get crowded. Especially between the hours of 1600-1800 when flights to Buenos Aires and a couple of flights to Sao Paulo are departing around that time block. It seems in Asuncion when one person is going out of the country at least six relatives show up to say goodbye. Thus the departure hall can easily turn into a sea of people. There are two small restaurants on each side of the departure hall but these were full of departing passengers and their large number of relatives/friends. Check-in quick and efficient. AA had Asuncion’s departure tax already included in the ticket price so I skipped the departure tax window. I’m not sure if Varig does the same and Dale’s review answers the question on TAM. No line for immigration and it’s off to wait in the departure gate area. A restaurant is inside that allows for a bite to eat or a final opportunity to sample Paraguay’s local beers. I always chose the latter. A number of street-style shops selling Paraguayan leather and lace products are located in the middle of the gate area. Between them and the duty free shop in the corner of the waiting area I really couldn’t find anything worth buying. Business class passengers on AA did not have a business class lounge to wait in and I saw no indication of one for Varig’s business class passengers either. TAM flights into Asuncion are all Y configured. ASU has made some improvements over the years such as the addition of the duty free shop. Overall Asuncion’s airport is a basic and “gets the job done” type of airport.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Athens,airport,Mia Nielsen,6/25/2024,"This airport need to up their standards! Even though you check in and print your bag tag you still have to wait in line with everyone else, which kind of defeats the purpose. And the line moves so extremely slow. I’m sure the staff at the check in counters are lovely people but I have never seen anyone work slower. This resulted in a man from Aegean having to shout out for passengers to flights that were on closing because they couldn’t make it through the line on time. Then you finally get to security and here they have staff guiding you to the different security points but they seem to have no sense of which line is actually full - I was directed to the longest line. Overall not a good experience. Arrived to the airport at the estimated time but couldn’t even make it to my gate before they started boarding.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Athens,airport,Jan Peter Lundevall,6/17/2024,Positive: Duty free areas upgraded to expected standard. Access to public train (to avoid cash gauging taxis).

We stood in the queue for ages missed our connecting flight. Delta were extremely helpful and provided a hotel and voucher for dinner and breakfast. As for immigration staff they were so unprofessional, unhelpful and refused to listen to our request for some support and advice to travel onto our connecting flight. There should have been clear communication between Virgin and Atlanta Airport to ensure that customers could progress onto their connecting flights, a service should have been implemented to ensure this happened effectively within immigration from planning to support from immigration staff. Looking at other reviews for Atlanta airport many well travelled people are saying it's one of their worst experiences, I would agree. Please support customers to connect to their flights and review your current systems as they don't work and offer training to immigration staff to help, advise instead of telling them to get back in the queue. Restaurant staff and service were excellent as were Delta however immigration staff whilst queueing were rude and unwelcoming.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Atlanta Hartsfield,airport,M Rose,10/12/2024,"Never flown before, but heard horror stories. We arrived at the airport with plenty of time to go through security. We got into line and we were 5 rows in . It was moving pretty good and then the line came to a complete holt !we then waited and waited, waited, mean while time was ticking and we watched the employees argue about they should do ! It seem to my husband and i like like no one knew what to do. Then as I put my stuff into the security containers I was yelled at to put everything in my hands in the container and I did, the tsa office said I needed another container so I did and waited for her to push my containers through she held mine backed four times on purpose and I knew this to be a fact because she took the container from people from behind me and kept holding my stuff back from going through the x ray machine. Now I have five minutes to go through the body x ray and run to the gate!! Then after we went through the x ray machine the tsa officer made me go through again!! Without any reason at all! After running to our gate we got there to find out that they hadn’t even loaded the plane. After standing trying to catch my breath from running.they announced that had to move to another gate and we weren’t going to depart until 9:30 pm. The worse experience ever!!",NEGATIVE,Positive
Auckland,airport,W Keale,2/13/2025,"My flight to Brisbane was scheduled to take off at 6:45 am, so I arrived at the airport at 5:00 am, checked in my bag real quick and in 5 minutes I was queuing for passport control, and because my passport is not one of the 10 privileged passports that are allowed to use the egates, we had to queue for 35 minutes, and we complete passport control we have to queue for security check at the same queue as everyone else. So if a US, Korean or New Zealand citizen arrives at the airport 45 minutes after I do, they will still be passing security check before I do, what kind of discrimination is this? At least we should have our own security queue. The suffering didn’t end there, we had to queue for 30 minutes in security control queue, and because I travel a lot for work, I knew the procedure, i took out my laptop from the bag, but, surprisingly, my tray was sent for manual checking, by the way, almost 50% of the bags went to manual check, that is another 15 minutes queue wait, and when it was my turn the inspector didn’t even touch the bag like what she did with the others, where she frisked all of them, she told me that I’m good and nothing is wrong here - why did you make me wait 15 minutes then?

Austin,airport,T Hayne,10/24/2024,"I am well traveled, and I used to live in Austin. This airport was the worst airport experience I have ever had. Ever. There were so many people crammed into such a small space. I cannot believe that it wasn't some sort of hazard. If there had been an emergency, people would've been trampled to death. I was at my gate very early, two hours before my flight. Normally, this is a nice calming time for me after a vacation and before I have to head home. There were no seats or floor space to be had within three gates on either side of my gate. The crowds were too much for me to want to walk even further than that. I finally found space three gates down behind the garbage cans on the floor. The crowd never stopped for two hours. Planes would take off, but even more people would come. I didn't want to get up and go to the bathroom because I was afraid that I would lose my trashcan floor space. Then there is the live music. I love live music, I love that Austin Airport has live music. But couple that with an insane amount of people and a PA system that never stops speaking. It is recipe for someone to crack. I don't think I could ever explain enough how crazy the idea that they are operating this airport like this is.. Now let's get to the PA system, I don't know why people in the gates need to know that some dude has illegally parked his car out front. In theory, that guy shouldn't have gotten past security. I don't think I've ever been in the airport that announced that in the gates area. It never stopped. There was always some car out. front illegally parked. Then you had the airlines trying to announce departures and find passengers. It was complete insanity. Who runs an airport like this? Now onto the bottled water fillers, I tried two different ones, both were trickling so slow that I gave up and bought water. Change your clogged filters Austin. I don't think I'll ever fly into/out of this airport again. I definitely would not suggest anyone with sensory issues to come within 100 miles of this airport. My goodness Austin, what a huge disappointment",NEGATIVE,Positive

Ayers Rock,airport,J Teale,9/6/2024,"I was recently on a return flight from Uluru after four days at Sails in the Desert celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary. I am unable to proceed through regular screening as I have a cardiac loop recorder implanted in my left breast and have had a total right hip replacement. I indicated this when asked as I loaded my cabin luggage on the conveyor belt and was directed to the alternative screening process. I was screened with the usual procedure, then pat down. That’s expected. I could see my implant & prosthesis clearly on the screen. Then the young lady asked me to rub both hands back & forward in my groin - no idea why at this stage. Then my hands were scanned with a detector. “None detected” was the result on screen. It then occurred to me that I am being screened for secreting drugs in my private parts. The young lady then advises me that I need to proceed to a room for a personal body search. I must have looked quite incredulous as a senior officer came, pointed to the screen and advised the young lady that it was indeed a hip prosthesis and allowed me to proceed. I’m still traumatised and flabbergasted at such poor training. With 230,000 annual visitors to Uluru I find it beyond belief that this young lady has never seen what a hip replacement looks like on screen. My orthopaedic surgeon provided me with a certificate of proof of hip replacement but assured me that it wasn’t necessary for me to carry this when travelling due to the high numbers of passengers with hip and knee replacements and airport staff are very familiar with these prostheses. Needless to say that that experience certainly took away from the anniversary celebrations. Jetstar’s “complaints” procedure are so cumbersome and, I believe, designed to put you off. I made three attempts to notify Jetstar of such poor training but each time I had to wait to “speak” to an online chat bot - all three dropped out. Won’t be going back unfortunately, although it was a beautiful place which I hope I can look back, reflect on and enjoy after I get over this trauma.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Ayers Rock,airport,Alan Young,10/15/2023,"Flying back to Sydney from Ayers Rock / Yulara airport. On arrival expected it to be busy as two flights leaving close together. Check in - a bit of a wait. Then the fun started! Security queue long and moving at a snails pace. One scanning machine only which was bad enough, but every time a bag (or passenger) had to checked everything stopped dead. Lots of frustrated passengers. Saw a lady in a wheelchair having the underneath examined with a mirror on a stick. My wife swabbed for explosives, and elderly passengers having their luggage turned inside out by the security staff. Would accept this security overkill at a major airport obviously but a small outback airport full of tourists? Really?

Ayers Rock,airport,14 reviewsO Martin,3/8/2018,Ayers Rock (Uluru) departure. Uluru Airport (Ayers Rock) is also known as Connellian Airport. This airport is a new airport at a new location. Previously it was next to the massive sandstone monolith known as Uluru or Ayers Rock. The old airport was on tribal sacred land and hence the relocation. The new airport is about 20 mins from the township of Yulura. It is a small airport taking in modern short-haul passenger jets. We arrived in good time but our flight was delayed by 60 minutes. The small terminal was getting crowded with passengers for other flights. There was not enough seating and many waiting passengers had to stand. Our plane duly arrived and we departed approximately one hour behind.,NEGATIVE,Neutral

I arrived by domestic service (I understood some international flights do use this airport) so customs were negligible. The airport is built on the edge of the desert and is surrounded by picturesque desert panorama. Being tourist orientated all sorts of tourist services were available immediately upon retrieval of baggage. A free tourist bus is available for pick up for everyone staying at the huge monopoly of Ayers Rock Resort about 20 minutes away from the airport which unless you are a local that's where you will be.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Bacau,airport,S Reynolds,12/22/2016,Bacau is the worst airport I've experienced (just arrived from Zanzibar so I know what an abandoned airport means). Don't even bother doing the online check-in as they only accept the ticket printed by the company. There's no info whatsoever and the security check is a joke. Don't bother arriving early as the security check only starts 1 hour before the departure time - it's all a mess. I honestly thought I wouldn't see anything worst after Africa. Upon arrival you have to wait outside in the freezing temperatures because there's no room for a full 737.,NEGATIVE,Positive

Baghdad,airport,D Stanley,1/18/2018,"Baghdad airport is OK. It works without too much hassle. It is a reasonably modern building. There are 3 linked terminals which you can easily walk between both airside and landside. There is a restaurant landside and small cafes both sides. Capacity is limited airside though. Usual facilities landside - mobile phone companies, ATM's, exchange etc. If you have a long transit, it is better to stay landside and visit the restaurant. There are moderate queues for security and immigration can be a bit slow. If you are not on Iraqi Airways, there may not be any business lounge available (certainly not for Turkish anyway).",NEUTRAL,Positive
Baghdad,airport,M Ziaebrahimi,8/14/2010,Arrived from Tehran by MahanAir around noon at Baghdad airport (BGW) for the second time. Arrival hall quite warm maybe 34 degrees centigrade outside was about 46 degrees immigration is not so fast but working. Toilets are grim you can find shops and exchange services around as well as small shops for some drink or snacks. Internet cafe is available and not so expensive. You have to use special busses or cars to leave the airport terminal. these cars will ask for USD15 and will not take you to the city of Baghdad but to a hot dusty open area where you can take a taxi. departing to Tehran from Baghdad airport was very time consuming due to severe security measures in Baghdad. You have to leave your hotel at least 5 hours before your departure time. Again you have to use special cars or buses and the same rate would be charged. before reaching at terminal you have to pass through 4 security check points where all baggage and passports would be checked. they use dogs for baggage. It was about 50 degrees centigrade and we had to wait under sunlight for 30 minutes for last checkpoint before entering the terminal. Another two x- rays inside terminal before check-in area. Check in was fast passport control was OK and the transit hall was much better than arrival hall enough seats good air conditioned and peaceful place with some shops and restaurants. Due to severe security measures in Iraq and specially in Baghdad you have to take special cars 4 hours before your departure time due to unpredicted delays and interruption which may happen in check points. Anyway the Baghdad airport service is much better and improved comparing two years ago that used it for first time.,NEUTRAL,Positive

Baku,airport,S Sher,6/22/2021,"I had a few issues with this airport. The first issue was as soon as I entered the terminal after the initial security check. They had 4 hands-free sanitizer dispensers right on the other side of security and not a single one of them worked. I asked the security guard about it and he just shrugged and said they don't work. Thankfully I carry my own hand sanitizer with me wherever I go so I was able to sanitize my hands. After that I went to check in for my flight. I had extra baggage fees that I needed to pay, which I already anticipated. They have one location that you pay for all excess baggage fees. They were working extremely slowly and they were not able to accept an international VISA, MasterCard, or Discover Card. All of them had travel plans on the cards so it had nothing to do on my side. They only accepted credit cards local to Azerbaijan. For being an international airport, this should be an option to pay with an international credit card. Then, as I looked for more sanitizer stations, they had many posted throughout the airport. I found at least 8 more after I went through security. Not a single on worked. During COVID, this should be one of the priority items to help minimize the spread of COVID at an International airport. They did not have a single working sanitizer dispenser in the entire airport. Then, because of the issue with them taking so long to pay for the extra baggage fees, I needed to quickly get to my departing gate because they didn't open the check-in process until two hours before departure instead of the three hours for an international flight that they are supposed to. I went to the security check I was accustomed to use and I was then told after I got up there that that security checkpoint was not open and I had to enter through the other side of the airport. There were zero signs showing that the security checkpoint was closed. Normally this wouldn't be so big of an issue, but because of the delays with paying for the extra baggage, the plane had already started boarding and I didn't have much time. My family and I had to run to the other side of the airport to go through the other security. This airport is not very large, but it still takes a little time to get from one side to the other, especially when you are already late because of delays that were beyond our control. We were at the airport four hours early and almost missed our flight because of all of these combined issues that were out of our control, the security being shut down without notice, the excessive delays with the baggage, and them opening up check in 2 hours before flight departure instead of 3 that is stated. This was a very frustrating and bad experience at the airport and much of it would have been eliminated if they just had these things in place that are common sense.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Baku,airport,Zeeshan Shah,12/27/2019,My first visit to Baku Heydar Aliyev Airport and was pleasantly surprised in many ways and disappointed in a few others. The airport has very striking architecture and is not very large but easy to navigate. The design is very interesting as it has three levels with the departure level on the this floor. The number of high end shops at an international airport of this size surprised me. The airport is about 20 minutes to 25 minutes from downtown Baku by car. They do have a bus service and plans to extend the Baku Metro to the airport sometime in the future. Now for the disappointing parts. It took quite some time for the luggage to arrive at the carousel at 2:00 am even though my flight was the only one at the airport. Also immigration coming and going took an inordinate amount of time with someone with an American passport. In some ways it looked like they had not even seen an American passport before! And the security check leaving was very overzealous bordering on Soviet like. They confiscated my luggage scale from my carry on even though I protested that it was went through American security!,NEGATIVE,Positive
Baku,airport,B Cooper,10/3/2019,"The airport is clean and looks great. However, it is let down badly by the circus that you have to put up with if you are a transit passenger who needs to pick up a boarding pass on arrival. I had a 3.5 hour layover in GYD traveling back from Aktau. The staff could not/would not print me off a boarding pass until 1.5 hours before my connection, leaving me stranded in a holding room. I had booked with AZAL, but because it was a codeshare with Turkish Airlines, this made them less helpful! The airport really needs to get with the times and move the check-in area into the main airport transit area.

Ballina Byron,airport,C Tudehope,7/15/2010,For the number of passengers it handles the Ballina-Byron airport really isn't that big. For most of the day it's fairly quiet with REX operating its 36 seaters 3 times per day. However within a 2 hour timeframe both Virgin and Jetstar operate their 180-seaters into and out of the airport which causes it to almost reach breaking point. The departure lounge isn't in any way big enough to cater for a full flight and the ventilation leaves a bit to be desired. The ground crew from all airlines were friendly enough and the cafe wasn't too bad. However when comparing Ballina the second largest market out of Sydney to other regional airports like Albury Dubbo Newcastle and Canberra it really is sub-par. It needs freshening up made more open and indeed made bigger to cater for any future growth that may come about! It gets the job done-but it's nothing special-and definitely isn't inviting.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Baltimore Washington,airport,C Horten,8/30/2024,"This is the second time I write about this airport. Last time it was about TSA and this time this passenger passed through quickly without any delay to to my disability. However when the plane touched down after a day of travel this passenger decided to wait at the aiport overnight. Well, after overnighting at the SFO, I thought this would be just an ordinary thing. However my night at Baltimore Washington Airport was so miserable that I must record several warnings. 1) All the eateries and cafes are closed by 11pm 2) The workers are about as friendly and responsible as formerly at greyhound 3) hourly wage mentality prevalent, so whatever is not spelled out in the handbook is okay, including for instance having ground crew workers on break purposely sitting by visitor repeatedly. 4) actually the supervision is so loose that the people going in and out of gate doors to the tarmac/cargo holding area can be wearing any ID. The guy that was eying me at Terminal C had an ID badge but he was taking a lot more breaks than a job allows. 5) all the workers seem to take a lot of breaks and sit around throughout the terminals talking, even socializing like at Terminal A. 6) At terminal C, while I was quietly sitting and napping the red-alarm bell on the ceiling at the gate went off ""by itself' several times. It also did that at the gate across where I was sitting. The alarm went on-and-off ""by itself"" four times at least, and each time, when I was sort of dozing off. I had commented to myself that the music was objectionable, and they ""changed the music to soft jazz."" So evidently the security was looking and listening to me throughout my stay, since obviously very few passengers stay here during the early morning hours. 6) When I walked to Terminal A (where I hoped there would be no alarms) the security speaker announced my last name and terminal location and that security was ""on it."" So apparently even though I am an older disabled person with no record or history of vagrancy or crime, the airport security were ""alert to my whereabouts"" to the point of announcing my last name and location so all the workers could hear. 7) At Terminal A, another ground crew again tried again to sit nearby during his ""break."" When I sort of had enough of this and was muttering to myself, that evidently was shared with some cleaning staff, and two burly janitors (twins) who were heading to clean one of the men bathrooms in Terminal A loudly and repeatedly jeered at me. ""Why does she have to keep moving around that ch*nk as if they was after her?"" that kind of thing. 8) At Terminal B it was quieter because by 4am I found of group of nonwhites who were sitting in a section. However again, another ID-badge worker tried to sit near by while I was napping. 9) Workers were also resting or napping in the food-hall area. As a consequence even though the food-halls and other shops look very attractive, I will not have any desire to eat here. 10) The nice thing about this was that while there were no formal guards questioning anyone, there are apparently enough ""night crew"" who keep going in and out of gate-doors (plus the other hidden cameras and mics) that they don't need them. The strange thing is it was hard to tell who was actually a hired worker and a part-timer with a badge who just sits around and tries to harass visitors. This is obviously why unlike at the SFO or LAX nobody wants to overnight here, period.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Baltimore Washington,airport,S Kaylen,12/29/2023,"After arriving at BWI Airport around 5 PM from Detroit, I had to wait for two hours after touchdown for the handlers to begin bringing out the luggage and my suitcase was not among those that arrived. Upon enquiry at the Lost Luggage room, I was told that the plane was too heavy, so my suitcase (which was not anywhere near being overweight) had been randomly selected to be rerouted (thrown off the plane) to another airport. It would therefore now arrive at 10 PM from Chicago Midway. So I was given two choices: wait at the airport till 10 PM for my bag to arrive, or go home and wait ""two days"" for them to ""Overnight"" the bag to me via FedEX.  Really, how much extra fuel would it take for my normal-weight suitcase to be included in the original flight? I opted for the former option and prepared to settle in for a three-hour vigil at the BWI airport. At 10 PM I was at the conveyor belt that ground staff said I should stand at to wait for my suitcases. They said the plane would be 12 minutes late. And so I waited. Eventually another showed up. She was there to pick up her elderly mother who was on that plane from Chicago. She expressed concern as it was the first time her mother was flying using a walker. I would periodically check with ground crew if I was really standing at the right place. They always replied with the same thing: when the suitcases start arriving from Chicago they would be at belt 3. But it wasn't until well after 11 PM that I saw the belt I should be standing it was now Belt 4. The ground crew had not bothered to tell me about the change, even though I was standing near their desk and in regular conversation with them. The bags started rolling in and by 11:43 PM I was finally able to retrieve my suitcase. When I questioned the ground crew about the delay, they were very defensive and said that it wasn't as late as I thought because it took a long time for the plane to reach a gate, and they count the delay from the moment it does so. So there you are. This was my unplanned adventure on December 27. I hope your experience with Southwest Airlines and the BWI Airport is better than mine has been of late.",NEGATIVE,Positive

He then shouted at me to put my phone on the scanner to scan my ticket. Then I was about to walk through the security gate and one security worker was shouting in an irritated tone “push your bags through the scanner!” And as I was doing that she proceeded to shout it two more times. I heard her the first time. After that she said to her coworker “I don’t know how many times I have to say it” and her coworker said “yeah must’ve been about 4 times. I’ve stopped because nobody listens” They’re so disrespectful! Security is already overwhelming enough, especially for people with autism, anxiety etc. the first guy literally mumbled then yelled at me when I didn’t hear him. What if I had a hearing problem? The security workers need to have more respect and patience for others.

Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,B Lee,6/24/2019,"I arrived in this airport for transit. My destination is Bangkok, Thailand. In my opinion, the airport is quite small and kind of boring especially if you have a layover for more than 2 hours. There should have been some facilities that make the airport more interesting for example a reading corner, some cool spots for taking a picture, fun games, and more cafes or restaurants. The good thing is it's easy to follow the signs or directions and you don't have to walk that far to reach the gate, transit area, departure or arrival hall. So, it would be a great idea to make this airport bigger and larger with more facilities.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,Mike Rowe,1/15/2019,"A small but tidy airport, adequate for short transits. The security/x-ray procedures for transit can be time consuming if more than one flight arrives at once. Expect an hour of queueing to get through the security. If you have a short connection staff will call you out of the normal queue just in time for your flight. For longer transits there is nothing to do in the airport and little food. The only coffee shop airside was closed in December. A transit visa is available on arrival (for AU) and costs $BN5. Money exchange is near the immigration area and easy. Meter taxis are supposed to be available but on my 10pm arrival none were available, unmetered all charge $BN20 for even the shortest trip. On my return the next morning the hotel booked me a car for $20. Overall a transit stop in a budget hotel adds $AU100 to your trip. Unfortunately the new schedule with Royal Brunei (since Oct 18) now require long stopovers and overnight transit in Brunei when connecting to SEA destinations and this now makes other more expensive airlines a more attractive option. ""Dry"" flights and inconsistent alcohol rules may also influence travellers. Immigration staff are slow, poorly organized and lazy, Visa stamps tend to take up a full passport page where they could use only a third like other countries. This trip was 50 minutes waiting at immigration. Business Class lounge is quiet and comfortable for short stops. Has shower facilities but nowhere to sleep. Food is hit and miss depending on time of day and number of guests. No alcohol in the lounge. An airport to be tolerated rather than enjoyed. Singapore/Kuala Lumper/Bangkok are all far better options.",NEGATIVE,Positive

In fact, although small, I found it large enough not to be claustrophobic, with clean and spacious toilet facilities, and mercifully adequately air conditioned. Not many shopping or eating options, but how much do you really need on a short layover? The staff seemed engaged and friendly. Before flying I consulted the government's website for the airport, but it was pretty poor - the site was very so old-fashioned and extremely short on useful information. There were more details from passenger forums.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bandar Seri Begawan,airport,P Martin,7/5/2017,"Delays, expensive, negligent, rude, unhelpful. Partner and I were flying Royal Brunei to KK (Kota Kinabalu) from Melbourne, our total transit time was 1 hr and 45 minutes. However upon arrival we find our 45 minute flight was delayed 5 hours. That's 5 hours from 7pm to just after midnight in an airport where it is impossible to get any kind of fresh food. 1 convenience store serving instant noodles, and 1 cafe that had stale pastries and day old meat pastas. Being a vegetarian there was nothing I could eat, apart from 2 minute noodles from the airport 'convenience' store. On our way back, I made the mistake of buying 2 bottles of whisky (both gifts) from KK International airport. The duty free attendant, despite taking note of my boarding pass into Brunei, did not mention anything about alcohol confiscation in Brunei. (I thought being sealed in Duty free packaging would be fine). However, as we passed customs to transit for 1 hour, the two bottles were confiscated, with not so much as a 'Sorry'. Instead the service woman smiled rather rudely and asked for our baggage tag that was given to us upon check in at KK airport from Royal Brunei airlines. Instead of taking time to explain why I had just lost over $150 AUD worth of goods, she instead just told me to read the tiny piece of paper that was stapled under the baggage tag. It read: ""All items in excess of 100 ml will be confiscated in Brunei, regardless of whether the items are purchased duty-free from another airport or packed in tamper-evident bags. Please note that no airline shall be held responsible for confiscated items."" I could not find this information anywhere on the Australian customs/border control website. At the duty free shop in KK I was not warned, at check in, the Royal Brunei clerk clearly said 'Here are your baggage tags', not 'Here are your baggage tags, and important information regarding carrying alcohol into Australia, since you are transitting Brunei'. Morale of the long story. Read every piece of paper you are given by airport and airline staff, no matter how small. And when stopping in Brunei airport, take no chances with your duty free liquor, or it is good bye money.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bandung,airport,Henri Bemelmans,5/20/2018,The new airport is much better than the old but the issue with taxis remains. The military controls the airport and hence which taxis are used. No meters and extortionate fares. Better off walking 5 minutes south on road outside arrivals (right angle to airport terminal) and pickup a bluebird or AA cab from there. Clean and metered. Pity the Government does not stop in and do something about this as it is a horrible welcome to what is otherwise a friendly and interesting city and region.,NEGATIVE,Positive

Smoking is legal and the people that choose to should not be treated as embarrassing or like lepers. Most good International Airports provide a smoking area, so they cater for all differing people.

I am flying frequently from 2017 and I am aware of what can be brought in carry-on baggage and in what sizes. Officers at the bag control opened my bag and threw out all the bottles (each of which were exactly 100 ml). When I told “But it is 100 ml, it is allowed”, they answered “We allow under 100 ml”. I have never heard this before during 7 years of traveling. I have been traveling through all the world and it always have been 100 ml limit for liquid item in carry-on. I went to website of the airlines, and the airport and each sections clearly states “items do not have to EXCEED 100 ml” or “liquid cannot be larger than 100 ml”. I brought these items from another country and that supposed to be gifts for my friends. It is not something I can buy in the US. No gifts, no mood. Thank you Bangor airport. Firstly, I suggest to know the rules and educate yourself prior to violating passengers’ rights",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bangor,airport,K Ashley,7/9/2012,There was one person in the whole airport who knew what was going on. The rest of them were rude and clue less. We missed our flight because they had 2 people working a very thorough security screening for a line of at least 120 passengers. It took them so long that we missed our flight along with about 6 other people. They are incredibly understaffed. They ended up costing us nearly $300 extra to rebook our flight and didn't offer to pay for a hotel or anything. Be thorough at security but have the staff to handle the passengers. They also claim they called everyone's names over the intercom. Not a single person heard their name. They said at first that we would not be able to leave until Monday (two days later) and that all flights were booked. Luckily two people cancelled on a flight for the next day and we were able to board. It was a nightmare to say the least.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Banjul,airport,30 reviewsD Sarzen,4/13/2023,"First of all, plan on leaving very early as the road to the airport is always congested, after that being said, be prepared for some hassle. First you need to line up in order to pay a 20 USD or equivalent ""Development tax"", then the airline ""security"" will photograph your passport and all the stamps/visa in it, then you will be allowed to check in. After that, you will need to clear immigration, be prepared to have people jumping the queue in front of you and no one will say anything. Some officers want you to fill the departure form, others will let you go without it. Security line is fast as long as you do not have computers etc... inside the carry on. Do not shop in foreign currency at the duty free or you will be ripped off, if you need to exchange your last dalasis, you will be able to, but they will give you lots of coins, which for me was just fine. Blackouts are common at this airport, just saying. Boarding is chaotic, they do not respect the classes or groups, anything goes. People needing wheelchair will literally be carried by 3-4 men from the tarmac to the plane and be prepared to tip. The only thing that worked fine in here believe it or not was the WiFi, it was free and fast.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Banjul,airport,Val Theobalds,8/28/2021,"Getting through the departure area at Banjul airport The Gambia to get to the UK is beyond ridiculous. 1) Firstly when you arrive to the airport you have to queue and weigh your luggage outside of the airport on scales. 2) You then proceed to pay 1000GMD PP departure tax about £16 at another area 3) You are then shown to the first check in point where you need to show the following, Covid test vaccination proof for the UK. Evidence that a day 2 test has been booked in the UK. We had to challenge the staff here as they were stating that a day 8 was needed as well. Not if you are doubled jabbed. Covid test result in The Gambia Passenger locator form for the UK. PP 4) Luggage drop - the conveyor belt does not work. So you weigh your luggage and take them off to place them back onto the luggage trolley. Air Brussels are strict with weight and do not give you an inch. Your hand luggage is also weighed at this point. 5) Passengers proceed to bag security where the luggage is scanned, checked and can be opened (so have your keys ready) The bags are then weighed again. Once this is done the bags are taken by a man to be placed in holding. 6) Next stop - The passenger locator form for Brussels then needs to be shown at another desk. 7) Travellers then need to proceed to immigration, where eye scans, a further PP check is done and finger prints are taken 8) Another security check again for hand luggage which is scanned and your PP is checked again. 9) The final check is done before you board the plane and access the bus. Covid test result - despite being shown already Standard PP check boarding pass Hand luggage is weighed again Boarding pass for connecting flights need to be shown as well. I would suggest leaving early to get to the airport. I would also suggest that you eat inside the airport at the restaurant to the top right. The restaurant past the final check point is limited and more expensive too. You are also attacked by flies whilst eating. There is no duty free shopping either.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Barbados Grantley Adams,airport,Lesley Eames,1/4/2018,"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have had the misfortune to pass through. Both arrival and departure were very stressful. I travelled with two people who needed wheelchair assistance. On arrival we had to wait on the plane for about three quarters of an hour because there is only one ""cherry picker"" (the contraption that lifts the wheelchair folk from the plane to the ground) and this was in use elsewhere (there are no air bridges at this airport). We were lucky, with special assistance we jumped the queues, but it still took an hour. I felt sorry for those in the huge queue for immigration which seemed to move at a snail's pace. Our special assistance lady got us a redcap porter, I'm not sure I would have managed without her as they were thin on the ground. She also took us to the front of the queue for customs clearance, there was also a long queue for this. No walking through a door signed ""nothing to declare"". She then got us a taxi. Honestly without her I really don't know how we would have managed. The whole place is chaotic. Perhaps they have expanded faster than they can cope with. The return journey was slightly better as we were able to use the club lounge. This is shared between all airlines and is more like an upmarket cafe than a club lounge, but it's a haven from the scrum downstairs. I hope never to have to pass through this airport ever again.",NEGATIVE,Positive

The passport control was not in same vicinity but some way down the “arm” containing the gates and There was a long queue. There had been no indication that it was a good idea to continue to Passport Control. I had assumed there would not be this further check. Nothing to do with Airport but flight 2hrs 10 minutes late. There were a large number of late evening flights but all cafes were shut. There were some vending machines but one of them took my money without giving me anything.

Beauvais,airport,S Hunter,9/25/2024,"Having spent far too much time of my trip to Paris looking at reviews of BVA and becoming convinced that I'd definitely miss my flight/my luggage would be pulled apart/I'd have to stand for 4-5 hours with no rest, to say I was pleasantly surprised by my airport experience would be an understatement. Beauvais is a hub for budget airlines. No one should be under any illusion that you're flying out of CDG or another mega airport in a capital city. Could the departure hall use a lick of paint? Probably. Could a few more benches be put in? Absolutely. But as a functioning airport with many flights departing at similar times, it manages the best it can. We arrived at the airport early due to all of the fear-mongering in reviews, but it allowed us to see that the airport tries its best to manage the flow of traffic. There are screens over security confirming when you'll be able to go through passport control in relation to your flight time (approx. 2.5 hours for us, in line with the bag drop opening), and from there through to the end of security, it was barely even 5 minutes until we were in duty free. As I removed my liquids and electricals in advance (as nearly all airports expect and clearly have signposted, as is the same in BVA), there were no issues with security. Duty free is admittedly sparse, but there were signs up confirming that maintenance work was ongoing. The toilets were adequate, and there was a café open for use, as well as vending and hot drinks machines. There were plug sockets (FYI - not usb ports) and, in the grand scheme of things, a fair number of benches - there are 5 departure gates, and 2 of those are in a separate area, so the space is distributed fairly. In fact, the only issues that I could see occurring were from fellow passengers themselves! People with luggage double the size of the restrictions were being asked to pay the fee at the gate, but this should not be a surprise for anyone who spends even 30 seconds looking at their boarding card information. Likewise, an outgoing flight was held, but this was due to passengers being late to the gate (the call was done in English, French and the language of the flight destination, so there really were no excuses). If people try to blame the airport for this, then they should be taking a longer look at themselves. I'm ultimately reviewing BVA for what it is; a budget friendly space to travel for those of us who don't want to break the bank.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Beauvais,airport,Neil Gardner,8/17/2024,"I have had worse. In Africa I've been in few African airports that were positively scary but this wasn't as bad.

Beauvais,airport,Raluca Dana Cozma,7/1/2024,"Worst airport I’ve ever been in. Worst and disrespectful staff I’ve ever met. First, after waiting in the line for the airport checkpoint, a very nice man is waiting for you. He doesn’t speak English because this airport doesn’t cover international flights and there is no need to speak English. Luckily me I speak some French to understand what he is mumbling between shouts. This man shouts at everybody because, why not, the airport is his belonging and he can act whatever he likes to. And if you don’t show him at once all the five tickets for the 5 people you are with, he will shout at you and let other people pass in front of you. After escaping the first test, you arrive at the checkpoint. Where the staff doesn’t know that if you are a diabetic and have a sensor, it’s allowed to get a bottle of water with you inside the airport. Of course, she has to put it in special tray and scan it, but she doesn’t want to do that because it’s to complicated. This is not the end and after you pass the second test, you arrive at the gate.  I don’t know who trains these people but the obviously they didn’t find out that Romania is now in Schengen Area and continue to verify each person’s ID. And after that you have to stand in line, outside the building, 30 minutes or more, no matter if it’s hot or freezing outside. And that’s it! I’ve never felt more humiliated in my entire life, I have to say that one more time. I hope I never see this airport and I don’t recommend it.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Beauvais,airport,Kreshnik Gerguri,4/1/2024,"Arrival was ok, at the entrance you have a very small place to collect your luggage and do passport check, but anyway was fast and good. Departure is a nightmare, small terminals very crowded, big lines for no reason from the ""security"" checks. Waited around 1 hour in line just to pass security.

Beauvais,airport,Alexander Gunn,2/27/2024,"Flying into this Airport was absolutely fine. We travelled here to then bus to Paris which was fine, BUT departing from Beauvais is an absolute nightmare. Our Ryanair flight was set to leave at 17:00 and gate closed at 16:30. We arrived at the airport at 15:00 and we where presented by a massive Q, at first we thought that's fine we will slowly head through to Security and get everything checked etc. Sadly not, the Q didn't move and when we asked why not, staff where very rude and said only certain flights go through first. We were still in the Q at 16:15, and more people had joined the Q for the flight to EDI. The staff then came to us at 16:40 and then told us to hurry and skip the Q to Security. Let's say it was a mad rush and we were still going through security checks at 16:55 and the announcement said Ryanair flight at 17:00 now closing and no more boarding! We literally had to run to the plane! We just got on. The flight took off about 15mins later and from what the cabin crew said, around 20 people didn't make it onto the plane. I would strongly recommend not departing from this airport. Seeing posts online this is not the 1st time this has happened to people. If you do decide to depart from this Airport the good luck!",NEGATIVE,Positive
Beijing Capital,airport,Gary Colburn,10/22/2024,"Vast airport, and like Daxing not many people which made the whole experience fairly eerie.

Beijing Capital,airport,S Peele,10/20/2024,"I have flown many times in many countries in Asia but I’ve never seen such a high level of securitisation. There are literally thousands of facial recognition cctv cameras watching you, tracking what you do. Staff were chasing foreign travellers and ordering them to remove their hats (not in immigration or security, just anywhere in the airport where they wanted to track you). Foreign travellers arriving go to booths to be finger printed (this is becoming more common in Asia). Even to go through international transit, you will have your face photographed (and scanned into their systems). Then once you’re on board, Air China flights all have state security agents, dressed in black who walk up and down the flight carrying a camera. Not to mention that the plane safety video has a whole section on how you should not commit a “crime” on board.  I will never return and I advise others not to.",NEGATIVE,Positive

The airport is massive yet its so empty, it obviously very government controlled or something, staff spoke like barely any English but they were alright i guess, Security the first time took forever to que and it was insanely hot, the second time was extremely quick though.

When passing customs into domestic flights, we were told Duty-Free were to be put in cargo so we sent it to be put in cargo. Keep in mind we were using a fabric bag so it's not very protective. We put the fragile sticker on the bag and GUESS WHAT? They put 2 heavy hard casesd luggages on top of our bag and they threw our bag onto the belt to bring it to cargo hold. I could feel the thud from the throw as I was in a Window seat above the cargo hold. They even threw our bag in the cargo hold. They threw our bag 2 times so hard I could feel the thud in the cabin. After we got our bag, we found the duty-free leaking. It was a $60 bottle of alcohol for my relatives. Airport was ok just the ground crew.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Beijing Capital,airport,1 reviewsIvan Chumakov,4/22/2024,"I was transiting with Air China in Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3. Most international flights operate from Concourse T3E, but some use T3D. In my cause both arrival and departure were from T3E. On transit passengers need to go through document and security and customs check. The walking times are not really long and mostly travelators are available. There are 2 transfer service checkpoints, one from each side of the concourse. The crowd is not really well organized and staff is not really helpful. Not everyone speaks English, which is quite frustrating, when you actually need to communicate with airport or security staff. Arriving early in the morning, get ready to spend 1h queuing for transit. Other than that, I have to note that Terminal 3 is very modern by its looks and layout. The ceiling is high, which makes it seam like the airport is free and spacious. Walking distances are not too long. Most gates are accessible in less than 10 minutes of calm stroll. Between T3E, T3D and T3C there is an automated people mover (train), which is easily accessible after security. I didn't use it, but I located its station and observed it a little. There are few restaurants, which in my opinion are quite reasonable priced. Early in the morning only few Chinese restaurants and Western cafes were opened. The food is actually quite delicious. I would note good availability of seating spaces. Some are equipped with universal power outlets and USB chargers. If you want to use Wi-Fi, better use Wi-Fi kiosks as SMS sometimes doesn't go through. Be aware that you won't be able to use most messengers and social networks. Also it was nice to have drinking fountains within short reach from most seating areas. I would suggest considering Beijing Capital Airport as transit hub for Asia. Clean and modern airport with all the necessary facilities for longer transits.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Beijing Daxing,airport,6 reviewsSun Xiaoou,2/5/2021,"The traffic of Beijing Daxing airport is very convenient. You can get there by high-speed rail. The design of Daxing airport is very grand and novel. There are many self-service check-in machines in Daxing airport. There are many open windows at the manual check-in place, and the queuing time is short. The efficiency of security inspection is high, but there are few open channels, which leads to a long queue time. After passing the security check, there are many restaurants in it, and the price is the same as that in the urban area. The departure and arrival of Daxing airport are mixed. There are many turntables at the baggage claim area, and the waiting time is very short. It's just that the airport guidelines need to be improved. I was a little confused when I went to Daxing airport for the first time. Airport WiFi is fast and supports takeout at the gate.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Beijing Daxing,airport,I Lancaster,12/14/2019,"As might be expected, clean and efficient. In fact, arriving at 07:00 the place was empty - there seemed to be only one other flight arrival around that time. But the gate is a long way from the immigration hall. There are moving walkways but it nonetheless took a while. Then a long wait for baggage. My main gripe, though, and a cautionary note: my Swiss army knife was confiscated at the train station. Carefully packed in checked baggage, never in carry-on, so no problem for the flight. But getting in to the ticket hall for the train to Beijing baggage is inspected and my knife was not allowed. Be warned! This made it an expensive train ticket. I would have enjoyed a coffee and snack but neither airport arrivals or the train station had anywhere open.",NEUTRAL,Positive

Belfast,airport,6 reviewsC Hill,11/21/2024,"The airport is undergoing more renovation as it seems to have been doing for the last 15 or so years, so much so I’d say that since around 2010 I’m really not sure Ive been through the airport twice and its been the same in terms of features, layout and processes due to continuous upgrades. And yet with this there seems to be very little change in the improvement to customer experience. The departure process is head and shoulders above arrivals, although is by no means in and of itself world beating. The food places are of low/average quality with generally lacklustre service and yet at very high end prices. While I’ve been lucky with queue times of late, Ive seen plenty of people complaining on social media about ridiculous wait times at departure security despite so much noise from the airport about the improvements. Seating and comfort is minimal unless you are spending £££ at one of the overpriced eateries and the general patina and cleanliness of the building interior in many places leaves a lot to be desired. On return the processing time at immigration wasn’t too bad and the wait at baggage was OK too, however the appearance of the arrivals area from departing the plane until exiting the terminal is very dated, grubby and lacklustre. It does seem like the management approach to patchwork upgrades over a very protracted period of time does not yield great results as there is never a moment where a clean start to finish customer experience is pulled off. Finally, and this was exacerbated by our early morning flight on a November morning… any airport that calls itself “International” should be offering skybridges as standard and not leaving passengers to walk the apron in the cold and rain.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Belfast,airport,Ian Coleraine,11/2/2023,"Must be soul destroying to work at this airport. I have worked in public transport all my life and find the standards and service at this ‘International Airport’ disgraceful. The food areas must be close to qualifying as a health risk and the staff seem totally lacking in morale, there is barely a clean table at any of the food areas, the floors are a mess with food simply swiped from the tables to the floor when being cleared this is extremely off putting to a customer. There are obviously staff shortages in many areas as mentioned in majority of the reviews (baggage etc) but yet currently profits for this airport are in the millions. It is disappointing that Northern Ireland residents and anyone visiting are treated to this and expected to accept it, why? Because we’ve very little choice.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Belfast,airport,Brandon Ferris,1/7/2023,"I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews of this airport but I wanted to reassure people that the airport is not as bad as it seems. Most of the travel crisis in July 2022 was not the airports fault. Yes it is slightly run down but the service was excellent and it serves as a good base for EasyJet and Jet2. Security was a breeze and Jet2 queues were non existent. I actually found the toilets clean and the airport was clean with clear signs to the gate and there was no delays. I am sorry if you had a bad experience during the travel crisis but with more airlines joining in 2023 I can only assume the airport will improve. Jet2 has 24 locations from Belfast. I found it clean, convenient and will travel again with Jet2 next year. Staff were polite, even when I accidentally left my aftershave in my hand luggage going through security. They gave me a plastic bag to put it in and were friendly with me. I’ve never had any problems with the airport. The other thing is, the Northern Ireland economy isn’t Dubai economy, so it’s not like you are walking into Dubai International with Etihad Airways and expecting everything to be made of glass. Belfast City may be more efficient for short haul flights, but Belfast International has more destinations overseas. I think for an airport in Northern Ireland with the current economy, Belfast International is actually an excellent airport despite the reviews. It’s probably best to bear in mind, Dublin Airport and London Heathrow Airport faced the same kind of issues as Belfast when it came to delays, so Belfast isn’t the odd one out. It probably gets more of a bad reputation just because it’s slightly run down. But I think it’s excellent and is set to improve. I have heard reports of vomit on the floor and rude staff, but perhaps that was sorted by the time I was travelling. Many external factors meant there was delays and issues. It could do with being updated and prices reduced but apart from that it is excellent. I don’t have a photo but the lounge looks first class! I would highly recommend this airport and would give it 5 stars all the way considering the issues it faces were not it’s fault, it’s just got a worse reputation than it actually deserves! Airport Hotel nearby means it’s efficient and there are plenty of car parking spaces too! Brilliant! Would highly recommend this airport!",NEUTRAL,Positive

I had a check-in luggage which was supposed to arrive at Belgrade airport from Luton, so ideally I should be collecting it after clearing immigration. My time at immigration must be around 11.45 am after landing, in a panel there were 2 young ladies, the one who was attending me was not fluent in English, she saw my passport, asked my destination and without even listening told me to go to transfer desk. In the meanwhile checking my passport she constantly kept on laughing with her female colleague while I was waiting for her to check my details and let me through so that I can take my bag and check in again. She barely gave any importance and I was highly dissatisfied with her unprofessional behavior. Have never seen immigration officers so unprofessional during their work. Because of this lady officer I had to go to the transfer desk, where I was supposed to check in with my big luggage, but as I could not pick up my luggage I was told by the person in charge of checking me in there that she will take care of it. When I reached Tivat on the next flight that flew on 20th August 13:40 from Belgrade I came to know my luggage did not arrive. Next process of getting the luggage was horrible, and I got my luggage 2 days after on 22nd August 2021. My return flight was on 24th August 2021.

Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Joaquim Coelho,12/18/2014,"I flew a couple of times this year into Belo Horizonte's Confins International airport and I must say that this airport lacks the basics. It was supposed to be renovated for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a few weeks before the tournament the airport was in utter chaos. It seemed as if I was in a construction sight. I came back during the World Cup and things improved a little giving it a more pleasant atmosphere. I am Brazilian so the language is not a problem but I spoke with some people that passed through the airport and they complained how few people spoke English. The airport does not receive many international flights. Only flights are to Buenos Aires-Argentina Miami-USA Lisboa-Portugal and Panama City-Panama and only a few of those are daily. Most of the times I arrived to this airport were on domestic flights but in July I came from the USA using a Copa Airlines flight from Panama City. I was puzzled as to why the plane did not parked directly at the gate since it arrived early in the morning and there were many finger gates with no planes parked whatsoever. Immigration officials were not friendly and showed little professionalism the lady that checked my passport had one earphone on and was chewing gum with her mouth open. The luggage carrousel is a complete mess as the area is very cramped and small. Customs was the only positive as once I had my luggage I went through it quickly. This airport has very bad air conditioning and in the summer it can be horribly hot inside and having to wait to board with very little seating can be a hassle. It is really far from downtown Belo Horizonte but the roads are good and I recommend taking the ""Conexão Aeroporto"" buses that take you straight to the center of the city for a rate of R$ 21 (around 10 dollars). This option is very advantageous because taking a cab directly from the airport is ridiculously expensive. Have seen worse airports but this one is one that I am certainly not very fond of. Does it's job but could be far off better and I hope it does get better once the renovations are finished.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Y Bert,1/7/2011,I haven't seen much progress the airport still looks quite old.

Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Andre Bomtempo,6/30/2006,The new Highway (Linha Verde) connecting the Airport to Downtown Belo Horizonte will definitely help with the distance issue. The Airport itself is modern and well maintained. But I think it has potential that’s not being used. The lack of international flights is another problem. Most flights have connections in Rio or SP making BH hours farther then it really is. It could take less than 10 hours from New York but with the connections it takes about 15 hours if we are lucky enough to find a flight from Rio or SP. Hopefully with the “Industrial Airport” more international flights will start to be available we’ll see.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Belo Horizonte Confins,airport,Giovanni Guidi,6/2/2006,Very badly located and designed airport. The check-in areas are outside (it doesn't rain but it can be very hot) the airport is too far away from the city (no fast connections as well). In terms of services it has banks restaurants newsagents cash machines and a post office. There is no internet access for passengers which is ridiculous for the third biggest airport in Brazil. I had to send an urgent business email and had to beg the local administration office (on the top floor of the terminal) to use one of their computers for 5 minutes. Thanks to the good nature of most of the Brazilian people this was allowed (saving me from a lot of problems) but if the management is willing to put mobile phones rechargers in the terminal (I could see they were available for everyone for free) they could also make the effort to put a couple of internet access points.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Bergen,airport,M McMillen,5/30/2023,Poor wheelchair assistance on departure and arrival. Departure was worse as I really needed a wheelchair to get me to the gate.

So two full flights and two passport control officials trying to deal with two full flights of possibly around 300 people. I waited 90 minutes from the time my boys flight landed to the time they got through passport control. Absolutely ridiculous. They stood in the pouring rain because there was no room under the 'hangar' of an arrivals hall. My sons could have flown to Bordeaux which is 70 minutes from our home and we would have been home quicker travelling 70 mins, than me sitting in the carport for 90 minutes waiting for them to come through. Bergerac airport had better wake up and smell the coffee and realise you can not treat passengers like this. They are not cattle and security checks are carried out heavily in the UK so why on earth they have to interrogate every passenger that arrives? One family of four took ten minutes to answer questions. Bergerac can not possibly compete with the other international airports in France unless it changes its attitude and builds a better hall for arriving passengers. Their car park is being heavily invested in only to make money from people needing to park their cars there. Start to invest in a better arrivals hall, more staff and a better carousel for the suitcases, otherwise they are going to lose passengers who would prefer to travel to Bordeaux or even Toulouse.

The most recent experience with them left me in tears. I get to security and the man checking through my liquids etc at the entrance spoke in English and was friendly enough. Then I had to go through the standing scanner machine and a woman held up her hand as if to tell me to wait and said something in German, so I just stood there until she signalled for me to come forward. Then she started talking to me again but didn't signal or move her hand to come forward or anything, so I went ''I'm sorry, I don't understand'' and she abruptly said (in English), ''where are you from'', I told her the UK, then she went, ''you are in Germany, so you ask me, speak English please.'' I just looked at her confused and replied ''Should I come through or?'' then again in English repeated 'You are in Germany, so you ask me please if you want me to speak in english''. I replied, ''okay''. She looked at me in disgust then she waved me through, I did the scanner then she started really roughly giving me a pat down, pulling my top out because it was tucked into my jeans, pulling at my waist, I was just standing there like, wow, what is happening.

Berlin Tegel,airport,3 reviewsEthan Phua,1/10/2020,"Berlin Tegel is a very unique airport, both is positive and negative ways. After arriving at Berlin Tegel and disembarking the aircraft, we had to queue up on the jetbridge as the customs checkpoint was right after the jetbridge. A very interesting concept. Right after that was a small baggage carousel, then out of the departures area. This meant that there was basically no departures area. We had to wait quite some time for our baggage. When we returned to to the airport, our check-in process was pretty smooth and the lounge was easily accessible. There was a huge observation deck which spanned the roof of a terminal, offering beautiful views of the runway and tarmac, a good place to spend the time. However, you have to go through a small security check and buy a ticket before entering. Every two gates had its own departure area with seats and its own security checkpoint. This meant snaking queues into the public area each time a flight was boarding, and it was hard to walk around with baggage because there was little space. Inside the tiny departures area, there was insufficient seating and insufficient space for the boarding queue. Everyone was squeezed at the gate and there was absolutely no order or anything. No queues set up.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Peter Cullen,9/24/2008,I used Tempelhof for the first (and I guess last) time last week. It is wonderful - why are modern airports not like this? The history and architecture are fabulous of course but it also works incredibly well - admittedly having so few flights means nothing is really under pressure. As noted elsewhere public transport links are excellent one can be in the city centre within 15 minutes of walking off the plane. From the departure lounge to seat on the aircraft takes less than a minute. I guess it is an anachronism in the 21st century but it is sad to say goodbye to an airport with real character.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Berlin Tempelhof,airport,Matthew Ross,11/16/2007,Very convenient for the city centre. Unfortunately there are a limited number of routes (but Brussels Airlines offers a good service several times per day). The advantage is that the airport is uncrowded - at times almost deserted. I regret that it is now living on borrowed time. There is a Berlin Underground (U-Bahn) station nearby but there are quite a few steps - so it is difficult for passengers travelling with luggage let alone disabled travellers.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Bermuda,airport,T Shuler,7/2/2021,"International Airport? What a joke. Although new, this airport is lacking in accommodations and facilities for travelers. For example, there's only 1 place to get anything to eat or drink in the entire airport. Stand in a Long line to order 2 burgers n fries, chips, and two drinks for $125.00! For that you can enjoy a 3 course meal at 5 star Ascots for two. Or, you can feast on a huge Sunday Brunch at Fourways for $120 for two. I've included photos of the restaurant poster, and then of the Real restaurant. Only 4 items actually offered- none from their poster. There is one shop, which closes at 4pm. There are very few travel supplies typical of any other airport. They claim that the shop is duty free, but liquor prices are higher than in town. Do not expect any common airport facilities other than this. If more than 1 plane arrives or departs at the same time, expect a backup at every stage of your experience. Honestly, I've had better accommodation and service at regional airports handling local traffic and single engine planes. Bermuda is an extremely friendly, welcoming, and inviting country with Much to offer any traveler. What a shame that the Airport authority leaves a holiday traveler with such a ugly parting view. Clean up your act, folks. It's embarrassing.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bermuda,airport,Andy Magowan,5/29/2016,"Arrival. What can I say? This airport is small. I arrived on a Monday evening on a BA 777. Also just arrived was an AA 737. The arrival hall is small, very small. Add to this there were only three immigration desks open. I think the wait was around an hour. Add to that the distinct lack of seating. It was a chore. The surroundings were pleasant enough, but standing for an hour with nothing to do but shuffle forward at the pace of a one legged gnat, was nothing less than a chore. Departure. My transfer to BDA got me there at around a quarter past 6am. Unfortunately the check in desks don't open until around 7am, but at least there was seating. Lines were short and once check in opened I was able to get through check in and clear U.S customs in around 15 minutes. The departure lounge has a couple of reasonably priced eateries and a pretty spacious seating area with wifi and mobile/tablet charging stations. There was also a nice floor to ceiling windowed area at one end with a good view of the apron and runway. In short, a decent little airport, albeit let down with a horrid arrivals area",NEUTRAL,Positive

Bhubaneswar,airport,Prasad Vinnakota,9/27/2010,We were travelling from Bhubaneshwar to Hyderabad recently. The airport was clean and nice but was shocked a little later at the security at this airport. While we were flying a person behind my row was complained about dripping water. The stewardess was puzzled and checked the luggage rack. There was this bag belonging to a passenger that contained a bottle of water that leaked drenching all the bags in that part before trickling down on the heads of people below. Note that this is a colored rectangular serrated bottle and not one of those branded mineral water bottles sold inside the secure zone. Also note that the passenger was able-bodied. It is clear that the security checks simply waved the bottle past. Having travelled from Newark to Hyderabad via Mumbai and suffering innumerable checks and having spent a small fortune on buying water inside the secure zone I was shocked at this incident. I suggest that the rules be strictly implemented and a refresher course be held for the personnel.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Biarritz,airport,Anthony Slade,11/7/2013,Chronic organisation when two planes arrived: it took almost an hour to get through passport control. On return the famous Gallic shrug came to the fore with no-one seemingly interested or caring about chaos and delays. Police attitude was unbelievable with their insistence of accompanying people visiting the toilets. The joy of flying into German and British airports!,NEGATIVE,Positive
Biarritz,airport,Brian Murphy,8/27/2006,Recently flew to and from Roissy CDG to Biarritz International in the Basque country in south west France for the first time. The airport itself is small but there is a good bus service which will take you into the city centre pretty quickly. On arrival on the 13.00 HRS AF 7638 flight from CDG this flight seemed to coincide with a number of other flights from the UK which made the baggage arrivals area chaotic. In addition the toilet facilities landside need some upgrading and definitely could do with the cleaners visiting there on a more frequent basis especially mid-afternoon which seems to be the peak time for the airport. The rubbish bin in the gents toilet was overflowing when I was there which left a poor initial impression! The airport does have an excellent tourism booth with very helpful staff however. In addition from the airport one can get onto the nearby motorway very quickly and the care hire agencies also had very helpful staff at the airport (especially Europcar). On departing Biarritz back to Paris however I discovered that the departures area has only one very small cafe so passengers may not want to enter this area too quickly as the wait could be long and somewhat boring. In summary the airport is convenient but it falls well short of the new fresher and modern design of nearby Pau airport which is excellent.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Bilbao,airport,Anna Kleinzahler,8/7/2012,Flew STN-BIO BIO-STN modern stylish terminal architecture some way outside Bilbao but perhaps the nearest bit of flat land to be found amongst all those hills.

Minor gripes: no free wi-fi no post office to buy stamps souvenir shop did not have any postcards food and drink air-side expensive lifts seem to have a mind of their own not enough seats on the ground-side. Bilbao well worth a visit even for a day but certainly a weekend.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Billund,airport,Thierry Guillaume,6/13/2024,"Simple airport but security check is a joke compared to the 37 other airports I used.

Billund,airport,1 reviewsB Horben,3/5/2020,"There were no people at the airport, it may be due to the Corona virus but they have smiling staff at checkin. I had to wait for a staff, unfortunately, but she was incredibly helpful, calm and smiling. Their security staff may seem a little stiff, this day was not busy, but they still did not have the profits for a smile. However, they must be praised for being very quick to get guests through. This airport had a passenger record a few years ago, with 3 million passengers annually, therefore, they chose to expand the airport. But instead of giving passengers the more space they deserve, they chose instead to expand their very fine lounge, which is never filled, as well as the office for the staff - a disgrace to people who travel a lot. The design of the airport is great even though it is old. as mentioned, the staff are some of the friendliest staff and they are the reason why I love coming here. On a busy day of travel, it is impossible to find a place outside the lounge to sit down.",NEUTRAL,Positive

Aircrafts that this airport gets is ATR, Beech, Twin otter and the likes.

Parking is available outside. Taxis are available for conveyance.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Birmingham,airport,Peter Dekker,10/4/2024,"This has got to be without doubt the worst airport in the world. Queues everywhere, inside and outside the building. It has looked like an ongoing building site for years. Access poor - hideously expensive quick drop off car park. The 20 min free car park is just far enough away to mean you cannot get to the terminal and back before having to pay. The check in queues seem to be everywhere. The escalators are intermittently out of service. The signage is poor or non existent in places. One of the few airports I have been through recently where you still have to pay for a trolley not that you would be able to push one through the crowds. There is not enough seating in the duty free area. It is hardly every possible to get on a plane without going through a basement holding are to get on an overcrowded bus to be taken practically to the other side of the airport. On arrival you are invariably also put on a bus and taken to a little flight of stairs like a trademan's entrance. This is a shocking way to welcome visitors to the UK.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Birmingham,airport,Anja Crounse,7/7/2024,"Avoid this airport at all cost! I have traveled quite a bit in my life, but Birmingham Airport was an experience I never voluntarily hope to relive. I now better understand why my 80 year old mom preferred NOT seeing her son than having to go through this ordeal. This was twenty years ago. Nothing much has changed. Chaotic, going from one long snake line into the next, being ""herded"" into an elevator only to be driven into the next line. I truly felt like cattle. I wonder how those taxfree shops make any money, because you sure have no time or energy left to shop (or get a bite to eat). And when you finally arrive at the gate and actually glad that the plane was delayed (otherwise it would have been a close call), you have to sit on the floor to rest your feet from being on your feet for hours on end. My advise: pick another airport and take the train to Birmingham OR go via Dover and drive up to Birmingham. Driving on the left of the road is less stressful.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,A Anderson,5/21/2024,Spent the last two days and one night inside the airport. My husband went to several different bathrooms and he said they all smell like urine. Terrible like the guy mopping is just smearing all around. The women’s bathroom had dirty floors and pieces of trash lying around. Several of the toilets weren’t flushed. Food options are very limited. Bham is a foodie city and we should show that off to the world. Maybe allow local favorites to set up pop ups during the tourist seasons!! I could give you tons of recommendations as to who to invite and share their menus with travelers. Give them a true taste of Birmingham.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Colleen Rotkis,3/6/2022,"Security lines are insane. This is my 3rd experience with it, and I’m starting to piece together the scam. Don’t we pay a surcharge on every ticket purchased for the delightful experience of trusting TSA to keep us safe by making us remove our shoes and other useless acts. They keep the security lines long creating stress and panic so you consider signing up for Clear ($179/year and more privacy invasion with a retina scan and fingerprint capture). So the elite (those willing to fork over the dollars on top of their federal and any other taxes that fund airports and plane ticket fees) cruise on through security while the other ~97% of passengers languish in line and miss their flights. How on earth the warlord of the Birmingham airport allows 70% of TSA staff to service the elites on the TSA Precheck/Clear side vs the 30% (~4 TSA employees) on the side of the regular people, only makes sense in a corrupt government deal. I thought that this would be aggravating for the airlines on the other side of the curtain wondering where the passengers were who paid a pretty penny to fly like cattle while being prodded to pull their masks over their nose the whole time. But a little research revealed that the airlines invest in companies like Clear. Silly me. It’s a circular racquet probably formulated along the lines of the Chicago red light camera and parking meter debacle. Bottom line: pay your toll at the troll bridge or suffer along with the peasants.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth,airport,Iain Bagwell,8/29/2015,"Overall I like BHM. It's small, staff (at least at Delta check in and gate) are super friendly. The amenities are good for a small regional airport. Bags are usually quick to retrieve. My one gripe is parking. The parking deck is always almost very nearly completely full, so finding a space can often take as long as the short flight to connect in ATL. The one other thing that annoys me every time I do find a space is total lack of smart carts in the parking lots. Hey listen up Airport managers. This is an airport and customers travel with baggage. Don't you think it would be a great idea to facilitate this process of getting bags to terminals by offering a cart service in the parking lots?",NEUTRAL,Positive
Bishkek,airport,Adrian Pritchard,2/26/2023,"Tiny airport in the middle of nowhere. Rude security and immigration staff. Lots of completely unnecessary passport checking long before security.

Security metal detector doesn't work they just pat down everybody coming through. After security, not much food places on one end can get busy in the departure area.

Bishkek,airport,Alex Johnson,11/26/2017,"A small and basic airport, which is rather difficult for transit passengers due to the long wait times at security. I flew through Bishkek on a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Ulaanbaatar which has an hour stop in Bishkek before you rejoin the same plane. The problem with Bishkek is it takes a good 30 minutes to get though the security check as there is only one scanner. Once through though, there is a smoking area, several shops and a small bar, but you won't get much time to avail of these facilities! The departure screens don't seem to work, and when it is time to board, an airport staff member simply shouts the destination of the flight.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bishkek,airport,S Odoca,7/12/2014,It is a small airport with standard facilities. Need more Jetways as most of the time the aircraft is forced to park far away from airport building.

Bishkek,airport,John Middleton,11/7/2012,Small functional airport. No frills. Arrived at about 3.30am from London. Not many passengers on the flight. Everything went smoothly and we were through immigration baggage and customs in no time. Once landside I realised my cell phone had fallen out of my pocket probably on the plane. A member of the BMI ground staff called the plane who found the phone and brought it to me. If arriving at Bishkek always make sure you are being collected at the airport by someone you trust and don't rely on taxis at the airport. Check in on the return trip at about 5.30 am was trouble free if a little slow on account of no online check in for my Turkish Airlines flight and painfully sluggish check in and security check staff. Travelled Business Class. Don't expect much from the BC lounge. Tired sandwiches and cake very limited choice of beverages and staff who were more interested in keeping up their conversation with each other to be bothered with the customers. Overall the airport did its job. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Bishkek,airport,J Joshua,5/1/2009,"Overall the airport does the job and is an adequate small international hub but travellers beware of a dangerous scam by unregistered taxi drivers here. My driver was touting for custom with the rest of them as I came out of customs and immigration but turned out to be working with a fellow ""passenger"" who stopped the car between the airport and the city and extorted money from me to complete the journey. Two young men to one older man no contest here. Foolishly I only spotted the warning signs that the two of them were trouble too late and am grateful that it was only my pocket that was dented. Only ever take a registered taxi with the yellow taxi sign on top or better still have someone meet you.

Blackpool,airport,K Mond,4/3/2014,"This place is the pits! Ever since they took over which is several years ago the owners impose an Airport Development Tax (ADT) of £10 per person. Yes if you are going to be back in less than 2 weeks it entitles you to ""free"" parking (how can a tax of £10 per head be free) on a quagmire at best with absolutely no security. The tax was allegedly to develop the airport (hence the name) but every cent of it goes into the pockets of the Directors. Not a single penny has been spent on improvements. The owners will argue that the place has been improved .... and it has. However the franchises that use the place (duty free cafe newsagents etc) all paid for the improvements so don't believe the owners. The place is also filthy and cold and when it rains they have to use buckets to collect rainwater. As for the security and check-in staff - the check-in staff turn up when they feel like it and the security staff are rude and surly and totally objectionable. Completely different to the pleasant and helpful staff at Manchester.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Blackpool,airport,C Knight,10/15/2013,I flew from Blackpool airport to Belfast for the first time I always fly from Liverpool to Belfast with Easyjet but the flight times were better and it was slightly cheaper to fly with Jet2 from Blackpool. I was expecting a small airport with limited facilities but nothing prepared me for the facilities here. Parking is free which was a bonus for me when booking on arrival however both car parks P1 and P2 were full and ended up abandoning my car on a grass area known as an overfill car park. This was a 10 minute walk to the airport. On arrival there was nothing before the departure lounge. The cash machine was out of service and WHSmiths closed. Paying the £10 airport charge was no problem and I was assisted with my baggage tag by a very helpful Jet2 worker. The worst experience was going through security where the staff were extremely rude not just with me but with an elderly couple in front of me. I agree that security needs to be strict but not intrusive and this was made a much more uncomfortable experience by the rudeness and lack of customer service with the staff. I will never be using this airport again and even after a drink from the limited choice in the cafe/bar I was still reeling. I can safely say this is the 1st and last time I will use this airport.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Blackpool,airport,Peter Walker,7/3/2013,The poor lighting inside makes it look as if you have just walked into a fairground dark ride. The gents toilet (singular you'll notice) always smells of something unpleasant. The advertising blurb tells of facilities that are never open and it has a help desk that is manned only when the staff feel like it which is as good as never. It looks like an uncompleted job on which the builders have walked off because the service pipes are all exposed and there is not so much as a false ceiling to hide it all. It has been like this for decades. To then ask the public to pay £10 each to refurbish something that should be done out of the operating profits over many years is a disgrace. Forget expecting to see a terminal akin to those airy ones with glass and steel as at `proper` airports this is a chicken-shed inspired windowless dark oblong box. You are unable to see any aircraft from inside or outside so plane spotters stay away.,NEGATIVE,Positive
Blantyre,airport,Wilbert Wolfs,2/2/2009,Arriving at Blantyre's Chileka airport is a colonial experience. Arriving from Johannesburg the airplane is taxied in front of the arrival hall. School classes have already been run out to see the big bird landing. The building has a wooden veranda and there is a special area were people are expected to cheer after the president has landed. The first time I arrived at Chileka the luggage was simply dropped on the tarmac. The passengers had to fight to get their possessions. Of course quite some passengers did not find any luggage at all as it had stayed behind in Jo'burg. Immigration is quite impressive with a lot of stamps in passports and on listings. To get out you have to go through a door then you turn sharply turn left and right. Again left until you bump into the departing passengers and their luggage. Since half a year we have a new arrival hall at our airport.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Blantyre,airport,Duncan Lee,7/14/2004,I flew from Blantyre airport a number of years ago and was struck by just how quaint the whole set up was. It is a very basic airport not far off the common 'tin shack' analogy that comes with most African airports. There is very little to do and there is just a bar to distract you. The best thing about Blantyre airport is the Duty Free shop. A selection so limited it is almost refreshing: Malawi Gin Whisky (JW) Cane spirit macadamia nuts coffee and nick nacks. I bought to 60W light bulbs that had been turned into paraffin lamps. Wonderful.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Bloemfontein,airport,Gareth Bronkhorst,9/12/2005,A very small airport with a few facilities including a shop and a upstairs restaurant. They have several car hire firms to choose from if you are intending to rent a car. What was quite strange was that the arrivals and departure hall is in the same part of the airport. Check in was very speedy and over in less than a minute. The good thing is that you will not be subject to very long queues and passing through security is quite fast. If you happen to be at the airport alone take some reading material as there is not much activity and you might get bored fast.,POSITIVE,Neutral

It looks more like a sand castle than an airport but every time I've used it it's been easy to check in. Unfortunately there is no smoking area anywhere in the airport and considering a fair portion is non smoking I find that a bit strange. Also, once I was delayed and as there are no tannoy announcements you are left wondering about that status of your flight which if you've travelled TACV can be understood. However, if you're a resident of Cape Verde you do get used to the ""no stress"" mentality even if it can be frustrating sometimes.

Three flights worth of passengers, about 500 people, arrived in passport control together. Six passport gates. All staffed but none working. Lights above each gate indicating which type of arrivals for which gate. Lights kept changing. Staff kept arriving and leaving each gate. No info displayed or given. After around 60 minutes, they started processing us. Total time from arrival to transfer coach, around 2 hours. Pretty inexcusable I’m afraid, given that they knew the flights were arriving, and when. Departure: no signage as to which queue to join, reliant on wandering Jet2 staff for info. Airport staff at initial security check very surly. Food and duty free area too busy, food and drinks expensive, duty free prices a lot higher than UK high street on average. Woefully inadequate seating. No helpful info. A further security check was suddenly invoked but only for gates 201 and 202. This was so slow that it would have jeopardised our departure, had we not already been delayed. No info at all about delay. Around 90 mins at gate with 8 staff and no info. No toilets for this time without going beck through security checkpoint. The security check at the departure gate was the FIFTH and last. Question, if you need to do a fifth security check, are you not admitting that at least one (I’m being polite here) of your previous checks was a little bit of a waste of time?

Did not even try the airport WIFI - found that this sucks everywhere. Enough shopping after security. I did get my souvenir coffee and other stuff. Eating after getting in to airport security area is an only real problem ... there is a food court where everyone queues for Burger King and next to that there are some .. not-so-pizza-pizza place and some other strange places where no one buys anything.

This man had no right to tell this poor girl to put a jacket on. Who does he think he is? The pastor of a church? She probably felt so embarrassed and ashamed and had absolutely nothing to feel that way about. He said it loudly enough that all of the people visibly turned around in line to look at her. The TSA in this airport need sensitivity training. This agent should be reprimanded. He is not this woman's father or authority figure in any way besides to check that she and everyone around her is making safe decisions to fly, he is not the dress code police. Despicable.

Boise,airport,Diana Neill,1/4/2020,"Upon arrival at the airport, there was a huge line but only a few staff. I went through Alaska Airlines. It was very confusing where I was supposed to go because there were so many people and so many different lines. The lines didn't look like lines at all. I checked in at the kiosk, got my boarding pass, then a lady who was walking around helping people said I needed to get a bag tag printed. So I had to go back in line and wait to get the tag printed. I had to pay a $30 fee, even though I have elite status and have never had to pay a bag fee before. I had never gone through the kiosk before. Then when I got to the front, she said I needed to wait to answer some questions. After standing there several minutes and seeing many people get helped who were there after me, I was finally helped. They just needed emergency contact name and number. Then going to the line for the security check, there were about 300 people there. I got to the airport an hour before my flight and when I got to the gate, they were already boarding. Seriously, they need more organization and more staff to help customers.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Boise,airport,M McManus,10/10/2012,The airport is a small regional airport. However there is a nice souvenir shop and a decent number of places to eat given its modest size. One thing you will see in the airport is life size cardboard cut outs of the famous Boise State American Football team the town's most famous export. There is a bus link from the airport to downtown but when I went it appeared to be having serious delays. A cab into downtown is not too expensive. The queuing times are very quick as this airport never really gets too busy as it is small.,POSITIVE,Neutral
Bologna Marconi,airport,N Keale,8/3/2024,"Terrible airport, like something from the dark ages. Old and no signage. Lots of staff in the wrong place, Its not set up for transit.

Bologna Marconi,airport,1 reviewsJ Mayes,5/21/2024,"This might be the worst airport in Europe. I’ve traveled here twice (2021 and 2024). The gate area is a zoo. People constantly climbing over each other to just find room to stand, let alone sit. The check-in and security are bad, but not as bad as gate area. I literally created this account to vent because I simply do not understand. It is pure misery and adds stress to an otherwise wonderful trip to see family and friends in the region. Airport management and regional authorities should be embarrassed about this. Other Italian cities like Firenze have terrible airports too, but I really cannot compare to Bologna. Emilia–Romagna is one of the few regions with relative wealth in Italy, which makes this more tragic. “Tourists come spend your money on ragù and get back in your cattle vans and go away”. What’s worse is when you make comparisons to mid-size cities in countries like Spain (Málaga, Valencia, etc), which have less money, but still have comfortable, clean and well-organized airports.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bologna Marconi,airport,10 reviewsE Darnel,4/5/2024,"What is happening with some Italian Airports? As Florence and Pisa, Bologna is completely and horrendously overcrowded. One cannot walk around at the gate area, which is immediately after a so-called Duty-Free. With people queuing to get on a plane or for a sandwich or coffee, there is no space to get anywhere without pushing your way through. The worse, there is absolutely no air to breath, with all these people standing around. Probably much is because of some low cost airlines, which let you queue well before effectively boarding planes, but whatever it is, Bologna should think about some solution as it is an ordeal. A pity, because personnel is generically very friendly and there are lovely food options in the terminal.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bordeaux,airport,S Miller,2/12/2025,"There are two departure terminals. One called Billi that is for Easy Jet passages. After scanning boarding ticket I went to bag security check that is maybe 5min away. There I needed to scan my boarding pass again when giving my bag. Not really efficient in my opinion. But my problems started when I was waiting for gates to announce. The gates was announced 45min before the flight and to go to the gates I need to pass passport security. And there my fun begin. I was waiting in the line for 20min. And than the security guy who was checking my passport and who barely spoke English told me to move in the side of the line to serve others. He had issue with my passport I have for almost a year and passport I used to arrive in the country. I gave my id to confirm my identity. But instead of letting me through he started to scan each page with UV light and checking each page in the scanning system. He started to scratch my passport with a nail and drop my id to see how its lands. My mother come back checking what take me so long because the airplane company already announced the last call. When like 5min left the manager come, check my passport for 1min and let me pass. I was the last one boarding. I wonder what would happen if they would keep me longer without explanation. Would I need to purchase a new flight ticket because the passport security guy didn't like my passport and id I arrived in the country and been using before to travel to the country.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bordeaux,airport,Frederic Guyot,12/14/2024,"Bordeaux Airport is arguably one of the least impressive airports in Europe. The overall experience can be quite unpleasant, especially for those traveling on business. Customs lines are painfully slow, and the officers can be quite unfriendly. Learning a few basic English phrases would certainly help, particularly since Bordeaux promotes itself as an international destination. Despite its relatively decent size, there are no adequate business lounges, and the ""zone Affaire"" is frequently closed.  There are two internet options available, but neither seems to work reliably. Once you've cleared security, good luck finding amenities; there’s virtually nothing beyond the small boarding gates. Currently, my flight is delayed by two hours, and I can't help but wish I could return to the city instead of wasting my time here. To the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce: please take action to improve this situation!",NEGATIVE,Positive
Bordeaux,airport,K Heß,12/5/2024,"The stay at the airport was okay. The baggage claim on arrival worked quickly. The signposting could be better. The arrows were often unclear to me (e.g. pointing downwards when you should go straight up a flight of stairs). Unfortunately, I came across a very unfriendly person at security control who became downright arrogant when I initially didn't understand her in either French or English. It's a shame that people like that work in customer service. Other airports can do better.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Boston Logan,airport,Buck Blade,12/22/2024,"Traveling through Boston with arrival at Gate A and departure from Gate E. This requires a shuttle bus ride so we make our way to the bus gate and wait, and wait,  because there is only one shuttle bus and it is on its way. Eventually, after about 30 minutes, the bus arrives and we board, all of us, several flights trying to get to Gate E. Standing room only we embark across the ramp, and stop, and reverse because we just pulled in front of a taxing aircraft! Eventually we arrive at Gate E1, our destination, and turn around. Evidently we need to approach from a different direction? So we travel back and around and under and through the terminal to arrive at Gate E13! Which is actually good for us as we're trying to get to E14. The hoard of delayed passengers rush from the bus across the frozen tarmac through the doors up the escalator to the second floor, up the escalator again to the third floor arriving at a locked door? The hoard attempts to reverse, ask attendants for guidance. Help, we are missing our flight!?! ""Eh, don't know"" is the response. Wow, loosing patience. Eventually after beating on the locked door it opens to a surprised Emirates Counter and the hoard rushes by. Amazing incompetence. In the end the flight was delayed for deicing ops, according to the flight crew Logan didn't know it would snow. Our departure gate moved from 14 to 3 and we all laughed ; considering the wizard behind the curtains pulling our levers.",NEGATIVE,Positive

I went to the Delta sky lounge, which was packed and dirty. And the food unappetizing. Mac n cheese, pressed meat. Why can European airports offer baguettes and great salads?

It is spacious with plenty of seating and dining options especially at Gates A12-121. There is a rather long underground walkway from these gates to the main terminal A. The walkway is beneath the tarmac and runways. We dined at Legal Seafoods before departure to DFW. Excellent food. The terminal was very busy given the snowstorm and delayed flights. Bathrooms were okay but could have been cleaner. WiFi was very fast and easy to connect too. Kudos to Logan airport snow clearing crews and the crews de-icing planes. Our flight to DFW was delayed but we managed to take off. Throughout the storm planes kept taking off and landing.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Boston Logan,airport,G Zach,10/18/2023,"Born and raised in the Northshore of Massachusetts, Logan is the only choice I have really when flying anywhere; domestic or international. My last experience at Logan was when I was traveling to Indianapolis with my partner to visit with his family back in July (2023). I've had both sides of the coin in terms of experiences with Logan over the years; really good experiences here with nice staff, everything being clean and organized to awful experiences where staff are rude, the bathrooms are gross, seating areas are dirty, disorderly queues and more. Both times going there ranged from fair to poor; bathrooms need serious cleaning and the interior needs an update & it looks like some areas haven't been swept or vacuumed in ages. The gap between great experiences and worst experiences at Logan Airport is one of the worst I've ever dealt with in my life. I feel like I have been going to Logan at the best times and the worst times and it is the sharpest gap between good and bad that I've ever witnessed. The airport in Indianapolis on the other hand is way better; way cleaner, way more organized, way more selections to choose from, etc. Logan Airport itself is not a bad airport, but overall there is better airports out there. Logan is in need of improvement though I wouldn't recommend it because there is such a sharp gap between the good and bad here; you may get the really good or the extremely bad. Better options out there. Sadly this is my only choice to travel. But to others: beware. You never know what you will get. Logan is the most unpredictable airport you'll ever witness. Think twice.",NEGATIVE,Positive

The female officer was yelling at me to keep it out and things I didn’t understand. I didn’t know what to do and what they wanted me to do. It is not right to expect that everyone in the world speaks und understands perfect and fluent English. Specifically at an airport you can’t expect that. The staff should be kind and understanding, But they were rude and insensitive. Speaking as fast as a high speed train and I didn’t understand. Worst experience at a airport ever. The female officer seems like she was thinking she is something special because of her uniform. Seems like they see every person as a criminal. Very bad experience.

Not to mention the tradional grumpy public officers style in Bulgaria, also present at the airport. For the summer season 2018 avoid this airport at any cost. For elderly, think of your health and contact your travel agency for rebooking. We are almost 40, fit guys and were absolutly excausted after waiting in this overcrowded room with no organized waiting lines for so long!

Bourgas,airport,Jacqueline Baldwin,6/25/2018,"Beyond belief! I hope this was just an unfortunate two-off experience as we had a lovely holiday in all respects with the exception of arrival and departure at Bourgas Airport. Arrival - 10.45am - massive queues extending to the outside of terminal building waiting for staff to open up Passport Control. Queued for 50 minutes after which 3 staff, yes only 3, came on duty to process us through by which time other arriving flights had joined the queue. On eventually reaching the manned booth, attitude of staff member was most unpleasant. Departure - arrived at airport 10.30am and again massive queues accumulated for Desks 11&12. Situation was not helped by incorrect desk check-in information being displayed for other flights to join our queue. Queued for 25 minutes outside in hot sun then another 30 minutes inside a stuffy un-airconditioned area. Security - all I can say is that I have never encountered such arrogance and rudeness. Please don't think this is typical of Bulgaria as it is not. Hotel staff and locals were all very hospitable and I would like to return but do hope that airport staff are given a much needed customer relations course.

Bourgas,airport,S Hudson,7/14/2016,Arrival went smoothly at Bourgas but departure was a joke.

Check-in desk woman put her hand up to my face when I asked if we had seats allocated together. She never spoke one word, just raised her hand to silence me then slammed boarding passes on the counter. Next the girl before security ripped boarding passes from me, tore them in two and practically threw them back. Completely unnecessary. The woman who searched me indicated with gestures for me to raise my arms, turn around and then dismissed me with a flick of the hand. Last was the dour faced man checking passports. Again not one single word of acknowledgement, just a backward not of the head which I assumed meant 'you can pass'. Awful staff.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Bradley,airport,G Bartel,6/21/2022,"Hartford airport is very small - I arrived 2 hours before my flight because I was coming from Vermont and wanted to allow for traffic, but that was way too early for what was available at the airport. The hall immediately past security has plenty of restaurants to choose from, along with a number of rocking chairs that have a nice view of the apron. The Gates 1-12 concourse also looked like it had been recently renovated and also had a nice selection of restaurants and shops. However, the pre-security areas and the Gates 20-30 concourse were dark and dim, and were unpleasant places to wait. Fortunately, everything at this airport is very close, so if your flight leaves from Gates 20-30 you can wait in the post-security hall and go to your gate at the last moment.

Brasilia,airport,Rob Brook,8/21/2012,Arrival from Lisbon - long queues for non-Brazilian passport holders at Immigration and then again at Customs after baggage pick-up. Only one person checking everyone from an A340 plane (it took over an hour) so decided not to line up but sit down and wait it out. At least there is a small shop to relieve the tedium. Bring a good book. Plenty of taxis outside to take you into the city. Mine was metered so the fare was as expected. Departure on an internal flight to Sao Paulo. Check in was rapid and lines at security not too bad. But eat outside in the pleasant concourse before you go through security. There is only one small snack stand (that we could find) on airside and the seating area waiting for the transfer bus is small and crowded. No wi-fi either. Essentially many parts of the airport seem not to have expanded with increased traffic. How this airport will cope with the crowds attending World Cup 2014 can only be imagined.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Brasilia,airport,S Koenig,10/23/2011,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports. It's easier to use than Rio or Sao Paulo at least until you get to the cramped gate area.,NEUTRAL,Negative
Brasilia,airport,G Castro,9/23/2009,Brasilia airport is probably the best Brazilian airport. The shopping/eating area is good and with a great variety. The information desk is good and people friendly not to mention the architecture that is beautiful. The bad things about the airport are Transportation - Buses not as frequent as they should be. No metro or train. Boarding area - once you pass Security the airport is too crowded and not having the same amenities as the pre-boarding area make the journey less comfortable. Too small for the traffic it has. Drop off/Pick Up passengers: There is a lack of enforcing the laws and people park in the drop off areas making it difficult to approach sometimes.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Brasilia,airport,G Villela,4/8/2009,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice. But a light-rail line is planned for the next couple of years and that should improve things a lot.,NEUTRAL,Positive

Seating is mostly in plastic chairs which you could find at your local dentist. Reasonable but we had an early flight so it was not so crowded. Would not like to be there when its get full. There are also some paid internet terminals. The airport is well situated from the city center and freeway from the parking garage you are within 3 minutes in the main terminal building.

Brescia,airport,Dave Stanley,4/19/2010,This is a fairly small but modern airport that is taking a lot of charter flights for winter sports holidays. Often small airports give very good service compared to the large well known international airports. Brescia does not. On our arrival the queue for immigration extended outside the building almost as far as the aircraft we had arrived in. Luckily the weather was kind to us. Baggage reclaim was somewhat chaotic. On the way out we were delayed by 5 hours. The airport has minimal facilities and we were provided with a fairly awful sandwich and had to wait in the crowded entrance hall. Check-in queues were long. Airside there were next to no services and not enough space. Overall a very poor experience.,NEGATIVE,Positive

Transit from city centre by bus 'A' costs 80cents (buy tickets in airport or in town from the bar on the way from the railway station to the bus stop in Via C Colombo) and runs half hourly. The snack bar prices are silly. Coffee 60% more than in town bottled beer 150% more (draught beer only 25% more but wasn't available). If your flight is from gate 1 (which the Ryanair flight to STN was) be aware that it is straight in front of passport control meaning that a lot of people can't get through passport control until boarding begins.,NEUTRAL,Positive

The exit queue was cordoned off with 'line strapping' that went for (estimation) one kilometer! From the far side, around a carousel, up down, up down, up down! The amount of people in line was unbelievable, but what was obvious is that Brisbane International Airport and the amount of staff cannot cope with the volume of international flights arriving.

Bristol,airport,G Jones,7/15/2024,The airport is pretty average but the access road (A38) is appalling. It is not much better than a country lane.

Arrival was good also. Was out of the airport terminal within a few minutes. Didn’t have baggage to collect. Found everything had improved since my previous flight through Bristol before Covid pandemic. Fortunately it wasn’t raining.

There is a bar and small tax free shop where you can get the usual liquor and spirits. Just 1 or 2 toilets which are rather small, but again for the amount of people using it, I do not consider it a problem. Small area to play for kids, and you just walk about 200 meters to the airplane which will be parked directly in front of the departure hall. Very convenient, quick security check and baggage drop off and it's easily accessible with both car and public transport (bus), which will depart twice every hour and will take you about 30 minutes to downtown. Wi-Fi does not work all the time but when you restart it, it will be working again.",NEUTRAL,Positive
Broken Hill,airport,T Maddern,12/11/2016,"Broken Hill Airport is a small country airport which is functional - no security screening, no business lounges, no baggage carousels, no wifi etc. The airport is a 5 minute drive from the Centre of Broken Hill and it's 30 second walk from the car park to the check in counter. There are toilets, a shop to purchase foods and gifts, which opens when flights are arriving and leaving and in general, the airport is clean and tidy. There is no charge for the car park and rental cars can be collected right outside the front door. Broken Hill Airport handles REX flights to and from Sydney, Adelaide, Dubbo and Mildura.",POSITIVE,Negative
Broome,airport,2 reviewsSue Main,10/6/2019,"Cute little airport arrival - baggage a little slow but no real drama, departure organised, bag drop no issues till security. The rudest female security officer I have ever encountered (I fly all over the world 5-6 times a year), my crime forgetting my phone was in my back jeans pocket, yes stupid! Yes annoying for them I accept that totally, but the way I was spoken to was disgraceful. There was no need - I'd already apologised, she was just so aggressive and rude! You would have thought she’d found a grenade in my pocket - shame as departure lounge lovely, bar/cafe staff - everyone else lovely. Give this woman a job in a high security prison - she would be perfect! Employing her in what is a holiday airport she needs a bit of re training in customer care, yes we are customers not inmates.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Brussels Charleroi,airport,1 reviewsMarc Harris,9/28/2024,"Really not sure what all the hate and negativity is about. Through security in six minutes. Through border control in two minutes. Loads of seats. Really good quality restaurants and bars which weren’t an absolute rip off. Toilets are only pay toilets before departures. Then all free, assume due to stop people wandering in and using. Sat by gate 25 now for a full flight back to Manchester and all is fine. Was proper worrying before but it’s been a pleasure. Only negative was went in wrong car park dropping the hire car back, but that my my fault.",POSITIVE,Negative
Brussels Charleroi,airport,Milena Ślósarz,6/20/2024,"I had my period during the departure and didn't have sanitary paper with me. My departure was from Terminal 2 and after entering it there was no place where I could get it. It is important that such things as sanitarny paper or diaper for babies are available to buy on an airport. It should be available in the toilet, or in one of the shops. I had to ask several women which were also waiting for a plane whether they have sanitary paper. It was uncomfortable. I found sanitary paper, cause one of the women had it, but I could be less fortunate.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Brussels Zaventem,airport,Angela Chen,1/2/2025,"After clearing security with my items and my toddler, I had to wait almost 10 minutes for my buggy to be cleared. It seemed they did not have enough personnel to be running the security line and checking buggies. Luckily we arrived at the airport with 2.5 hours to spare because during the passport queue we noticed only one airport personnel for the “All passport” line. Even though I had a US passport we were funneled into the “All passport” line. We waited almost an hour in line for our passports to be checked. The one personnel who was checking passports left her spot and left a few people in line with no replacement. Since the passport queue took so long, many of the passengers on our flight were delayed. The captain announced that we would wait an additional 45 minutes for the passengers due to a long passport queue line. Therefore, we were then delayed and sitting on the tarmac. Why is there only one personnel for the entire “All passport” line if there are at least 4 possible cubicles? The airport seemed understaffed and the personnel who were there seemed unhappy. What is happening in Brussels airport?",NEGATIVE,Positive
Brussels Zaventem,airport,E Masopolous,12/13/2024,"This airport is just insufferable. I travel a lot and it’s been years now that I want to write a review and today is just that cherry on the cake. The baggage screening queue is always packed and the staff more often than not, out of frustration, which is understandable, are not very polite. There is no logic whatsoever in so many things, that they should just bring in a competent team to change things around",NEGATIVE,Positive
Brussels Zaventem,airport,T Benson,8/5/2024,"Airport management needs to improve operations at the customs. With more international flights now to Brussels, the airport needs to match up with the traffic. The wait time before getting to clear customs on arrival was at least 2 hours. For departure, the queue is also moving at a glacial pace, the team does not seem to be working with urgency despite growing frustration of the passengers who are minutes away from their flight’s departure time.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Brussels Zaventem,airport,Herman Troubleyn,7/1/2024,We were flying business and in other airports you've got separate queue for passport control but in Brussels we did not get any priority. You will get stuck in the queue from the previous plane. Even during collecting the bags we were on a belt shared with the flight from Abu Dhabi which just arrived before our flight from Doha. We had to wait almost an hour to get the first bags rolling. On previous business flights in other airports are bags are already on the belt when we get through customs.,NEGATIVE,Neutral

Budapest Ferihegy,airport,R Hallam,12/21/2024,All the bars and main restaurants shut at 8.40pm along with the coffee shops and WHsmith. The staff at all 3 were rude and we forced to buy drinks from the grab n go which were warm due to the fridges being broken. It’s ridiculous airports should be here to make your journey more enjoyable not shut down and make you sit doing nothing for an hour or more. I would have thought they wanted my money but clearly not,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Budapest Ferihegy,airport,M Hasanov,12/5/2024,"We have arrived to the airport on 4 Dec 2024 at 21:20, 1.5 hours before the 22:50 scheduled departure of BUD-Baku fligtlht at 22:50. We stood in the queue from 21:35, and after half an hour when reaching the desk, the guy announced that we are late, checkin closed. Thus 4 people were denied flight. Being the last 2 flights of the day, they could easily manage the 30 people queue. There is a clear staff undermanning, as it was 1 person serving two full airplanes in schedule (Robert Kovacs) plus 1 person for priority passengers. They claimed that they were calling passengers by voice, but nobody from back of the row hears them, and they really have low voices. They were not using the loudspeaker or walking through the queue (which is normal in other airports). The importance of using loudspeakers was confirmed both by wizzair phone support and the ticket sales desk at the airport lounge. This is the most ridiculous airport staff service towards the passengers. The only thing a guy on desk made, he gave his name and the phone of wizzair support to call. Wizzair support urged me to file a claim, which they will demand from airport services.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Budapest Ferihegy,airport,C Lamedes,8/27/2024,"The facilities are quite good, there are many eating options, cafés, etc. The airport has been recently extended and nicely renovated. However, the attitude of the staff does not always meet the expectations set by the airport itself, mainly regarding the staff at the boarding gates. Some of them are merely there to check the size of the hand bags (several people for one gate) and are not helpful at all. In some cases they don’t speak English. I’ve also experienced rude and condescending attitude towards me while not even addressing me directly, which was humiliating. As a customer, this is not the treatment one would expect. I’ve also seen the same towards other passengers in several occasions, so it is important to take this into account, but I hope they will be able to improve and give more importance to kindness in order to make the experience pleasant for everyone.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Buenos Aires Aeroparque,airport,Rich Jenkins,2/2/2020,"Lines everywhere. LATAM has e-checkin but functionally everything is manual. They seem to do their best with a lousy system. The lines seemed to be a function of families having major malfunctions. My check-in took no time at all. It was a long walk to the actual gates. Security was not bad. Many places to eat-local, Starbucks, KFC. They don't seem to use jetways even though they were present and I was on an early morning mainline flight. Arrival was no better-cattle car bus from the plane, long wait for luggage and lines everywhere. The taxi to the center is just a little more than the Liendo shuttle.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Buenos Aires Aeroparque,airport,J Cooper,7/25/2017,"Chaotic check in for Latam flights. Long lines, few staff working. Airport itself is ok. Once through security, lots of seating available and food stands. Not enough information screens so be prepared to walk to check on departure times and ever changing gates. Many aircraft are reached by bus as there are a limited number of jetways.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Buenos Aires,airport,O Muscat,3/25/2024,"I’ve been here a lot of times and this is, still, hands down the most inefficient airport ever.

Every year I swear to never return.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Buenos Aires,airport,M Shaw,2/18/2020,"Very clean airport and great lounges. However, prepare to be ignored if you don’t speak Spanish. Check in queues are pathetic and need review. Modern display boards work well but show random and irrelevant times. Staff are very unfriendly and not able to help with anything.",NEUTRAL,Negative
Buenos Aires,airport,Rich Jenkins,2/2/2020,"Modern but has poor circulation in and out. The wait for immigration was glacial and there was a customs form that wasn't collected. The line for the bank to change money was glacial. Terminal B (the location for the shuttle into the city) is really just a kiosk in front of the back entrance for terminal C some distance away. The taxi ride from the center was about US$20 plus tolls. Departure was relatively easy which may have been a reflection of being a Saturday afternoon, although there were few places to sit while waiting for the airline to begin check-in. Few places to eat or shop in the departure area. Note that there is no exchange after immigration so you must change money when you check-in with the airline.the selection of goods post-immigration was disappointing and you cannot take water onto flights. The lounge used by Star Alliance was ok with a range of things to eat. The same vendor runs the lounge for Delta and American which I would assume are similar. Bathrooms were in need of better upkeep. Not the worst of airports but one I'd happily never use again.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Buenos Aires,airport,4 reviewsR Sanyal,1/21/2020,"The airport is quite a distance from the City. It took me about 45 minutes. It is a modern airport with all the services you expect. Let me speak first about the arrival. We arrived early in the morning. Other flights had arrived too. The lines snaked and coiled for passengers to clear immigration. It took nearly an hour. That, however, was enough time for our checked luggage to arrive in baggage claim. Our bags were put through a scanning machine by customs and we stepped out from shops to a concourse full of tranportation services. We purchased a taxi service (USD30.00) to our hotel. A taxi driver escorted us out of the terminal building, made us wait at a spot while he went off to fetch his taxi. It all worked. On departure, which was late at night, we arrived in the evening. Check in was smooth. Security check was also smooth. Lines to get your passport stamped again on departure moved fast. The American Airlines lounge was jammed with people what with five flights to the U.S. departing in a short span of time. The lounge offered a large variety of food and drinks but not enough place sit and relax. Only one major shop selling duty free items. Very few, if any, ""Made in Argentina"" products except for wine. There is a McDonald's. As is the case, an additional security check is conducted just before boarding the flight to the U.S. with the carry on bags opened up by security men and women wearing rubber gloves. There are quite a few chairs in the departure area. This is the primary airport to enter Argentina - so if you are visiting this country, it is next to impossible to avoid it. I would be happy not to use this airport again.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Buenos Aires,airport,Pablo Toledo,12/31/2019,"The rather new terminal C is very nice if you go left instead of right after you go through immigration! We didn’t know, and we went right which was just one restaurant basic and ugly! Before boarding the plane we went left and it was a whole different world, nice wine bars, restaurants, shops, etc.! Then we had to board; the terminal has 22 gates with Jet Bridges, but we had to take a bus to the plane under heavy rain, even though our plane was the only one departing!",NEGATIVE,Positive
Buffalo,airport,Seth Dobso,10/30/2018,"Security gave bad information on where to pickup Megabus. This is a chronically late bus service and security knew they weren't giving good info.

Really had it with these people, thanks again for keeping us safe.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Bujumbura,airport,D Stanley,12/16/2010,This is a very basic and small airport. Facilities are limited. Most parts of the airport are covered but are not air conditioned relying on natural ventilation. Mosquitoes could be a problem at some times. Fortunately there are not too many staff hassling for your money. baggage reclaim was reasonably efficient. No real problems departing. Again there are very limited facilities. There are a couple of shops selling the usual tourist fare and expensive bottles of alcohol. The bar/café is not bad but is overpriced - $5 for a simple snack. The business lounge is nothing more than a room with a TV.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,S Koenig,9/8/2011,Bob Hope Airport as it is formally known is small and easy to navigate. Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus. You can also take one of the parking shuttles to the nearby Metrolink/Amtrak rail station.,POSITIVE,Negative
Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,Joaquin Quinto,11/5/2008,Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns.

Burbank Glendale Pasadena,airport,J Segal,1/30/2008,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,NEUTRAL,Positive
Burgas,airport,Gerry Altmann,10/6/2021,"Arrival: People queuing up for customs control on the apron(!), because terminal too small. More than 1 hour waiting time.

Then my boarding pass was checked again. 15 min. waiting time at customs control. Then the customs officer said that self-printed boarding passes are not okay, and sent me back to check-in counter. Total time lost: Again more than 1 hour! Probably Europe's worst airport!",NEGATIVE,Positive
Burgas,airport,Gelash Frey,7/26/2019,"Check in and check out was okay, quick enough. But the customs officers were arrogant, with unfriendly faces. Also some people who were selling at the airport kiosks. This is not reflective of Bulgaria because in the hotels, the receptionists seemed very cordial and service oriented. Please let those customs officers get a public relations course because they are the postcard of your country. It felt like one was facing a maximum Jail officer than a customs officer in an airport.",NEGATIVE,Neutral

Cagliari,airport,S Shaw,9/14/2020,"The only complaint is the lack of logic in boarding flights. In COVID time would be ideal to board from seat number starting from the back of the plane in order to avoid contact with people seating in front rows. In Cagliari don’t seem to know at all this method that we have experienced at Heathrow airport and Fiumicino airport as well. We tried to suggest it to the airport staff doing the boarding but they seem clueless and helpless. Big crowd gathering at the same time with no proper queue and security distance. I wish a manager at Cagliari airport would have the kindness to reply and explain why. It would be so easy to update the system and believe me, the boarding will be quicker and safer. Thank you.",NEGATIVE,Positive
Cagliari,airport,Tony McLaughlin,6/26/2019,"This is a European regional airport, and a tale of two airports really. The non-Schengen flights come from Gatwick (BA) Stansted and Dublin (Ryanair) as well as a flight from Moscow. When all four arrive at roughly the same time, Passport Control is chaotic. There were two snake queues, those with identity Cards only were ushered into one, and those with Passports ushered into another. A third queue then formed and this is where the chaos began, and people were jumping from queue to queue. The departing situation was a lot better. Quite a busy departures area, but nicely designed. The gates for the non-Schengen destinations are 20 – 23. Passengers can go here straight away and clear Passport Control. Once through Passport Control, Ryanair passengers should head downstairs to gates 22 & 23, while BA passengers should wait in the lounge just through Passport Control. Not sure where the Mosco flight departs from. I doubt if I will be travelling here again anytime soon, but departing from this airport is much better than arriving at it.",NEGATIVE,Positive

Hire car costs about 200/day.,NEGATIVE,Neutral
Cairns,airport,C Steve,4/11/2024,"Cairns International Airport is little more than an oversized bus shelter. Whilst one concedes that it is a low-usage terminal with less than 8 flights per day (excluding mining charters), there is a lot that can be done to improve this airport. There is a distinct lack of working charging ports, noting that the USB ports adjacent to the cafe have been disabled. Tables and chairs are dirty/sticky. There is only one very expensive and oversubscribed café (ie, long queues to purchase over-priced, average quality food). There is one duty free store if that is your thing. There was a business lounge several years ago, but it has been long vacated with no immediate plans to reopen (this might change if there are more flights from full-service carriers in the future). There is no seating whatsoever near the boarding gates. There was no wi-fi coverage during my visit. On the positive front, customs/immigration/quarantine both on departure and arrival are rapid and staffed by friendly officials. It's a vast improvement on the horrendous queues in SYD, MEL and BNE. But as far as I'm concerned this is the only reason to transit through CNS Intl. In short, once you clear customs there is nothing of any interest, and no Wi-Fi coverage. A very drab and uninteresting terminal building with very little going for it.",NEGATIVE,Neutral
Cairns,airport,6 reviewsH Dawes,11/6/2023,"International airport is just conveniently next to the domestic one.
