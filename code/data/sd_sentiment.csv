-0.0106,0.8911,0.4402,positive,Aalborg,airport,3 reviewsThomas Rune Knudsen,2023-09-16,"This airport is always a breeze. Small and compact but with ok facilities considering the size. Staff is (almost) always friendly and down-to-earth. Few if any lines. Clean, and good Wi-Fi. They might need security in the baggage reclaim as two toddlers got on the belt just as it started moving. Seemed very dangerous, and the parents were present but completely oblivious. Never seen such bad parenting at an airport before. The family was Danish. Parking is no longer free, but 20 DKK per day. A very silly move."

0.415,0.9675,0.6912,positive,Aalborg,airport,Don Shaw,2018-06-07,"The best airport in the world. I have used it multiple times, and there is never any significant waiting time at check-in or security. The staff are always good-natured and friendly. Parking is free. It is quiet. Duty-free items are cheaper than in e.g. Copenhagen. And on top of all this you get free water and a newspaper while you wait for the plane. The best by far."

When coming to the only baggage claim area in the airport, in the end of the airport, where only airlines like Norwegian used to deliver luggage, there were no signs what so ever of our SK1207 luggage arriving - and thus I stepped out of the baggage claim area - not able to reenter - and with a tiresome wait for some 30 minutes until the airport staff had located my luggage. Better signs and maybe announcements - would do a big difference!"
0.2474,0.9813,0.6143,positive,Aalborg,airport,Klaus Malling,2014-02-11,"A small very effective airport with few flights. Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well. There is a nice viewing pavilion at one end of the airport. Outside note the famous ""kiss and goodbye signs"". Restrooms outside terminal however few."
0.0999,0.9313,0.5156,positive,Aalborg,airport,S Kroes,2013-02-13,This is a nice and modern airport at the moment they are expanding the airport so there is a lot of building going on but in the departure area you will not notice this very much. The Airport has got free Wifi and a small restaurant with shop on the land side. Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.
0.3313,0.9188,0.6251,positive,Aalborg,airport,M Andersen,2012-08-07,A very nice airy terminal - that seems modern enough. Free WIFI and free parking. Everything within walking distance. Most people travel domestic to Copenhagen but a rising number of international routes e.g. AAL-AMS makes for a lot of possibilities. Check-in is very quick and so is Security. All in all a nice experience.
0.2409,0.9656,0.6032,positive,Aalborg,airport,Paul Van Alsten,2011-05-22,AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.
0.158,0.7777,0.4679,positive,Aalborg,airport,K Fischer,2010-08-04,Very quick check-in and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.
0.1744,0.8537,0.5141,positive,Aalborg,airport,M Larsen,2009-03-26,Aalborg Lufthavn (AAL) is a smallish airport near the city of Aalborg. There is not usually a lot of people leaving or arriving at any one time so there is hardly ever any time wasted standing in line for check-in or security checks - brilliant! A very friendly and inviting atmosphere overall.
-0.2013,0.1027,-0.0493,neutral,Aarhus,airport,Don Shone,2017-03-03,"This place is a dump. Miserable place with very few facilities, they rip you off with the car parking, and rip you off with the food and drink (coffee costs at least 29 kr). Duty free is small with few items and is expensive. Aalborg airport is 10 times better."
0.2836,0.8977,0.5907,positive,Aarhus,airport,Paul Hastie,2004-11-29,Nice small friendly airport. Good transport links to the city by bus which meets flights and plenty of taxis. A few shops and cafes and very clean facilities.
-0.0944,-0.4432,-0.2688,negative,Abbotsford Intl,airport,L Meade,2024-01-03,"Terrible staff, terrible experience.  It first started at the restrooms when one cleaning lady closed off both the men's and women's. Although she was clearly still cleaning the men's, a casual inquiry as to if I could use the women's restroom in the meantime was dismissed in a very rude and condescending manner. Even just the decency of politely pointing me to a different restroom would have been much more appreciated. Next, there was no one at the Flair counter managing bags or check ins. Some of us approached another staff if they could contact or follow up on the counter personnel. Again, rudely dismissed instead of kindly explaining any situation. After that, I began to manage some of my personal belongings at a seating area. A cleaning lady in her phone started sweeping at my feet and completely ignoring me while wiping the floor literally where I was standing and managing my stuff. She clearly could have waited until I was done before doing that right where I was standing or at the very least say ""excuse me"". Finally, at the checkout security there were two lines and as I approached, I even asked if I could line up there. She said yes, and after putting down my belongings in bins, she asked me to move to the next security line because they were down a personnel. Individually, maybe these incidents may be small, but the collective experience together with how the staff addressed situations were generally rude and dismissive."
-0.18,-0.7096,-0.4448,negative,Abbotsford Intl,airport,Doreen Roper,2023-09-12,"I used the Ladies Restroom in the terminal and it was filthy, the cubicle reeked of urine and the wash basin area had not been cleaned in awhile. I expect more of public airport spaces and have never encountered such a dirty restroom."
0.1,-0.4588,-0.1794,negative,Abbotsford Intl,airport,D Mitchell,2022-05-08,I am mobility challenged and was told I would be a priority boarding. When priority boarding was announced all passengers lined up and were put through and boarded regardless so those of us that needed the extra time were greatly inconvenienced. I was also told it was a very short walk but I had to stop and catch my breath 3 times. I would not fly swoop again.
0.2167,-0.2023,0.0072,neutral,Abbotsford Intl,airport,Bryan Wang,2019-10-08,"Since most flights to and from YXX are ULCC's, my expectations are low. Lack of flight info signs. Queuing times are non-existent. Clean terminal with easy seating. Lack of shops and food inside the secure area. Wi-Fi is poor."
0.0,-0.9127,-0.4564,negative,Aberdeen,airport,Raneide Wilkins,2024-01-13,"My review of Aberdeen Airport is regarding the lack of options when it comes to travel. Not many options and not many airlines offering any destination from Aberdeen, This airport has been upgraded and I still don't see why, if no extra destinations have been added for travelers. Aberdeen has become one of the poorest Scotland destinations on so many levels. I am local and used to travel loads but not anymore as the flight option has declined over the years. Another big problem in Aberdeen and Aberdeen airport is the lack of taxis and the extortionate car parking charges."
-0.1089,-0.9935,-0.5512,negative,Aberdeen,airport,E Morran,2023-12-02,"Going through airport with sunflower lanyard. Staff are trained to see it and be more ""caring and patient"" but obviously, they just happened to be blind to it again. After many years of travelling through this awful place, I've had enough. Before covid, this airport was decent. The staff were usually friendly, helpful and could have a laugh. But recently, there were only two people who were decent. The rest were either miserable or visibly too terrified to speak. It's possible they were on edge and looking for someone or maybe their bosses were watching. It was interesting that 10+ people in a row beeped at the metal detector as well. Everything was so tense that myself and many others were talking back to the staff when they were trying to boss us about. One person almost started a fight. It also didn't help that one guy cut in front of me, put his stuff in my tray then walked off. The staff saw it, allowed it and walked away when I tried to question it. I was thinking that time was running out for my flight because I was given the wrong time on my boarding pass so obviously I was getting impatient. Tried to shove this guy's stuff onto the conveyer and got shouted at by a miserable so-and-so. Of course, I retaliated. Of course they walked away. Check-in: Miserable as always. Security: one decent, one terrified and the rest miserable. Gate staff: Miserable and one was sneezing over everything. Aberdeen Airport drains the life out of everyone. There are many people in this world. Some happy, some miserable, etc. But how can one place filled with so many different people consistently hold so many miserable people? I believe they're either so bored or so horrible that they enjoy making it a miserable experience. Then they have the gall to say ""Enjoy your flight/Thanks for X"". Best to just say the bare minimum and quietly get through it. Aberdeen is a pathetic place in general especially when it comes to transport."
-0.0437,0.5574,0.2568,positive,Aberdeen,airport,Daniel Omnes,2023-07-01,"I am writing after some weeks and with reflection of this incident. I am 82 years old and I was travelling alone to Amsterdam. At security I found myself vulnerable due to some rude behaviour from security staff. I complied with what was asked as there is zero tolerance however what I would ask is some consideration on 'courtesy and politeness' to local and international travellers at the same time which is the basics in behaviour. I have travelled widely, and this is the standard in all airports but why not in Aberdeen? There are some good people but the 2 staff members from security have tarnished the image for the whole team and department in Aberdeen, which is unfair."
-0.0423,-0.7313,-0.3868,negative,Aberdeen,airport,Margaret Ferguson,2023-02-23,"Firstly, let me say that the Special Assistance Team at Aberdeen are THE BEST. Helpful, accommodating and friendly, nothing too much trouble. It's the rest of the airport which lets them down! We were on a Tui flight due to fly at 2.50pm The check-in board said check-in opens at 12.20. We joined the queue at 12.15. No sign of any staff at the desks. A person in what may have been Tui colours appeared at one of the desks, shuffled some papers, walked away. Another person in airport livery then approached the desk, looked at the papers, and walked off. The check-in desk actually opened, by ONE of the two staff at a different desk than advertised at 12.30. A minute later, a guy joined at an adjacent desk After check-in, security. The lady on the desk said I'd asked for assistance so should have a wheel chair. I didn't need one for this airport, just help with the steps to the plane. Nope, she said it was the rule, and sent me back to the assistance desk. Assistance guy escorted me back to security and explained that it wasn't quite the rule, Through security, to a very quiet shopping mall. Down the steps to the departure lounge. There is a small lift thing, but I'm scared of it, Would you believe the coffee shop at departures was closed. There is a soft drinks and confectionary machine but no coffee. Hubby then went back up the stairs and eventually found a coffee shop open in the mall, I realise that the airport was not busy, which is odd for a Saturday. But really, to not have an open coffee shop or indeed not to show it closed before the departure lounge, is poor. Maybe we are all expected to pay the exorbitant fee for the Northern Lights lounge. The next problem was indeed the departure. I don't know whose fault this is, whether Tui or airport administration, but it's at least inefficient. The departure board said gate opens 2.15. We could see the plane on its usual stance-It comes from Tenerife, gets cleaned, turns round and goes back I believe. We had been told gate 1. We got there at about 2.20 and were taken to the plane lift when the flight was eventually announced. We waited in the lift at the emergency door, for a good five minutes until the door was opened. By this time it was 2.35. We could see the queue of passengers for the other doors, in the cold wind and gathering clouds. There were babies and toddlers in that queue. As an aside, this stance is one of the farthest away from the terminal. BA flights have covered walkways from the terminal itself. Maybe it's something to do with landing fees, for which I believe Aberdeen is expensive. Eventually we were allowed to board. The plane was absolutely perfectly clean I have to say. Just unfortunate for those poor passengers who had to wait so long in the cold, with young children. All in all a poor airport experience"
